0,Vancouver Art Gallery,"The Vancouver Art Gallery (VAG) is an art museum located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Situated in downtown Vancouver, the museum occupies a 15,300-square-metre-building (165,000 sq ft) adjacent to Robson Square, making it the largest art museum in Western Canada by building size. Designed by Francis Rattenbury, the building the museum presently occupies was originally opened as a provincial courthouse, before it was re-purposed for museum use in the early 1980s. The building was designated as the Former Vancouver Law Courts National Historic Site of Canada in 1980.
The museum was opened to the public in 1931 in a building designed by architectural firm Sharp and Johnston. The museum expanded its first building once in 1950, before plans were undertaken to move the institution to the former provincial courthouse building. The museum was relocated to the provincial courthouse in 1983. Plans were undertaken by the museum in the late 2000s and 2010s to relocate the institution to a new facility in Larwill Park.
The Vancouver Art Gallery's permanent collection serves as a repository of art for the Lower Mainland region, and has approximately 12,000 works by artists from Canada, and around the world. In addition to exhibiting works from its collection, the museum has also organized, and hosted a number of travelling arts exhibitions.


== History ==
In April 1931, the Vancouver Art Gallery Association was established under the provincial Society Act, in order to establish and maintain a museum for the City of Vancouver. The Association opened the art museum to the public at 1145 West Georgia Street on 5 October 1931. The building was designed by architectural firm Sharp and Johnston, and featured four galleries, one of which included a sculpture hall, a lecture hall, and a library. The cost to construct the building was approximately C$40,000.
 
Works by British, and other European artists dominated the works exhibited at the museum at the time of its opening. In 1938, the museum was the one of the buildings occupied by unemployed protesters during a sitdown strike in the weeks leading up to Bloody Sunday. No paintings were damaged while the protesters occupied the building.In 1950, the museum conducted renovations to its building, reshaping the design of the building towards an International Style of architecture; with the removal of the building's Art Deco facade. Renovations were also conducted to accommodate the 157 works bequeathed to the museum by Emily Carr, with the building reopened to the public in 1951. Cost for the renovation was approximately C$600,000, funded by the City of Vancouver government, and funds raised by Lawren Harris.In 1983 the museum was relocated to its present location, the former provincial courthouse. The building continues to be owned by the Government of British Columbia, although the museum occupies the building through a 99-year sublease signed with the City of Vancouver government in 1974; who in turn leases the building from the provincial government. Before the re-purposed building was opened to the public, it was renovated by architect Arthur Erickson at a cost of C$20 million, as a part of his larger three city-block Robson Square redevelopment. The gallery connects to the rest of Robson Square via an underground passage below Robson Street.

Plans to build a new building for the museum were undertaken in 2004, a result from its need for more exhibition and storage space for its collections. In November 2007, the museum publicly announced plans to move to seek approval from Vancouver City Council to build a new building at Larwill Park, a block formerly occupied by a bus depot on the corner of Cambie and Georgia streets. However, in May 2008, the museum and the City of Vancouver government announced its intention to relocate to an area occupied by the Plaza of Nations. The Vancouver City Council later reversed its decision in April 2013, opting to approve the original proposed site in Larwill Park. In September 2013, the museum formally issued requests for qualifications to construct the new building, receiving responses from 75 architectural firms from 16 countries. In April 2014, Herzog & de Meuron's bid was selected by the museum. The development of the Vancouver Art Gallery's new building is the first project for the architectural firm in the country. Perkins and Will's Vancouver branch was contracted as the project's executive architects.The cost to construct the building has been estimated to be C$330 million, with the federal and provincial governments expected to provide C$200 million, and the museum expected to raise the rest from public and private donors. Should the museum secure its relocation, the museum would occupy the building under similar arrangements as the former courthouse, with the museum leasing the property from the City of Vancouver. Completion of the building was originally announced to be in 2020 by the architect selection committee in 2014. However, as of September 2019, developments for the new building have stalled due to a funding dispute between the federal and provincial governments.


=== Select exhibitions since 2006 ===

The Vancouver Art Gallery has organized and hosted a number of temporary, and travelling exhibitions. A select list of exhibitions held at the museum since 2005 include:


== Building ==

The art museum is located in the former provincial courthouse for Vancouver. The 15,300-square-metre (165,000 sq ft) neoclassical building was designed by Francis Rattenbury after winning a design competition in 1905. The building was opened as a provincial courthouse in 1911, and operated as such until 1979, with the provincial courts moved to the Law Courts, located south of the building. The building was designated the Former Vancouver Law Courts National Historic Site of Canada in 1980. Both the main and annex portions of the building are also designated ""A"" heritage structures by the municipal government. The Vancouver Art Gallery moved into the former courthouse in 1983.The Centennial Fountain on the Georgia Street side of the building was installed in 1966 to commemorate the centennial of the union of the colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia; although it was later removed in 2017 as part of the Georgia Street plaza renovations. Shortly after the provincial courts moved out of the building, the building was renovated for museum use, and as a part of Arthur Erickson's redevelopment of Robson Square. The Annex Building is the only part of the building complex that was not converted for museum use.
The design of the building includes ionic columns, a central dome, formal porticos, and ornate stonework. The building was constructed using marble imported from Alaska, Tennessee, and Vermont. Construction for the building began in 1906 and replaced the previous courthouse located at Victory Square. At the time, the building contained 18 courtrooms. An annex designed by Thomas Hooper was added to the western side of the building in 1912. It was declared a heritage site and retains the original judges' benches and walls as they were when the building was a courthouse.


=== Gathering place ===
The front lawn and steps of the building has hosted a number of public gatherings and protests. The building serves as the monthly meeting spot for Vancouver's Critical Mass, as well as flash mobs, the Zombie Walk, pro-marijuana rallies, and numerous environmental demonstrations. The steps on both the Robson Street and Georgia Street sides of the building are popular gathering spots for protest rallies. The Georgia Street side is also a popular place in the summertime for people to relax or socialize.
In March 2007, the 2010 Olympic countdown clock was placed in the front lawn of the building. It was open for free for the public to see. The clock has since been disassembled, with one half going to BC Place and the other to Whistler Village.


== Permanent collection ==

As of December 2018, the Vancouver Art Gallery's permanent collection had approximately 12,000 works by Canadian, and international artists. The museum's permanent collection is formally owned by the City of Vancouver, with the museum acting as the custodians for the collection under a lease and license agreement. The permanent collection acts as the principal repository of works produced in the Lower Mainland region, with museum acquisitions typically focused on historical and contemporary art from the region. Approximately half of the works in its collection were produced by artists from Western Canada. In addition to art from the region, the collection also has a focus on First Nations art, and art from Asia. The museum's collection is organized into several smaller areas, contemporary art from Asia, photography and conceptual photography, works by indigenous Canadian artists from the region, and artists from Vancouver and British Columbia.The museum's photography and conceptual art collection includes photographs from the 1950s to the present, and includes photos by the N.E. Thing Co. artist collective, photographers of the Vancouver School of conceptual photography, and other artists including Dan Graham, Andreas Gursky, Thomas Ruff, Cindy Sherman, Robert Smithson, and Thomas Struth. The museum's collection of contemporary Asian art includes works by Eikoh Hosoe, Mariko Mori, Fiona Tan, Jin-me Yoon, Reena Saini Kallat, Song Dong, Wang Du, Wang Jianwei, Yang Fudong, and O Zhang.


=== Canadian art ===

Serving as a repository for art for the region, the museum holds a number of works by artists based in the Lower Mainland, in addition to artists based in other regions of British Columbia. The museum's collection includes works from Canadian artists, including members of the Group of Seven, Gathie Falk, Michael Snow, and Joyce Wieland. The museum's collection also features a significant number of works by Emily Carr, dating from 1913 to 1942. The painting Totem Poles, Kitseukla, by Carr, was among the original set of works acquired for the museum's collection prior to opening in 1931. The permanent collections of the Vancouver Art Gallery, along with the collections of the National Gallery of Canada, hold the largest number of works by Carr of any collection in the world.The museum's also features a collection of indigenous Canadian art from the region, including works from Haida, Heiltsuk, Inuit, Kwakwakaʼwakw, Nuu-chah-nulth, Nuxalk, and Tlingit artists. Regular acquisitions of indigenous Canadian works was undertaken by the museum beginning in the 1980s; with the museum's practices prior to the 1980s typically leaving the acquisition of indigenous Canadian works for the collections of ethnographic, or history museums.In 2015, George Gund III bequeathed to the museum 37 First Nations works, including totem poles by Ken Mowatt and Norman Tait, drawings by Bill Reid, and thirteen carved works by Robert Davidson. Other works in the museum's indigenous Canadian collection includes works by Sonny Assu, Rebecca Belmore, Dempsey Bob, Dana Claxton, Joe David, Reg Davidson, Beau Dick, Brian Jungen, Marianne Nicolson, and Lawrence Paul Yuxweluptun.

1,King Edward VII fountain,"The King Edward VII drinking fountain is a fountain in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was erected in 1912 to commemorate the King’s passing. Members of the Imperial Order of Daughters of the Empire  commissioned sculptor Charles Marega to create the feature. It stood outside the courthouse, now the Vancouver Art Gallery in a prominent location until 1966. In 1966 it was moved into storage to make way for a new feature, the B.C Centennial Fountain. The fountain was supposed to be moved to King Edward Street and Cambie Street but the Vancouver Parks Board did not have the budget for cleaning, moving and installing the King Edward fountain and so it ended up in storage until 1983. It now resides on the west side of the Vancouver Art Gallery, facing Hornby Street.

2,Robson Square,"Robson Square is a landmark civic centre and public plaza, located in Downtown Vancouver, British Columbia. It is the site of the Provincial Law Courts, UBC Robson Square, government office buildings, and public space connecting the newer development to the Vancouver Art Gallery.


== Background ==

The British Columbia Centre was a development proposal slated to be completed by 1975. At 208 metres (682 feet), it would have been the tallest skyscraper in the city (and taller by just 7 meters) than the Living Shangri-La, (which currently holds the record). With the defeat of W.A.C. Bennett's Social Credit government in 1972, the plan was scrapped just as the construction phase was about to begin. Government officials saw this potential Skyscraper as a potential disruption to the current Vancouver Skyline. The New Democratic Party government of Dave Barrett responded to fears of the dark shadow that the building would cast on downtown, and commissioned a redesign from another architectural firm, Arthur Erickson Architects. The reconceptualization Erickson came up with was of a skyscraper laid on its back, the ""B.C. Centre on its back."" 
Erickson biographer Nicholas Olsberg describes the design as follows: Arthur came in and said 'This won't be a corporate monument. Let's turn it on its side and let people walk all over it.' And he anchored it in such a way with the courts — the law — at one end and the museum — the arts — at the other. The foundations of society. And underneath it all, the government offices quietly supporting their people. It's almost a spiritual progression.


== Features ==
The new development was completed between 1979 and 1983, encompassing three city blocks and providing 1,300,000 square feet (120,774 m2) of space. The main component is the glass-covered Law Courts, which houses 35 courtrooms in the southern block.  It is 42 metres (138 ft) in height, and the glass roof has a  size of  420 by 115 feet (128 by 35 m),  is supported by a steel space frame structure, covering approximately 50,000 square feet (4,645 m2) of public space. 
The central block contains provincial government offices and, more recently, portions of the University of British Columbia's downtown satellite campus, UBC Robson Square, housed in the lower level.  Above, three cascading waterfalls throughout the complex provide natural air conditioning with 850,000 US gallons (3,218 m3; 707,773 imp gal)  of water.  An outdoor skating rink is located at the lower level that extends below Robson Street and connects to the northern block with the Vancouver Art Gallery, which was renovated as part of the project. 
Typical of Erickson's designs, Robson Square is constructed primarily out of concrete, but softened by its environmental design. In addition to the water features are trees and other flora as well as gradually inclining stairs with an integrated ramp. The open design allows for relatively unobstructed natural light and fresh air, and the waterfalls divert from the noise of downtown traffic. Landscaping on the project was designed by Cornelia Oberlander.
This public square has been highly utilized due to its successful design. As referenced by [William H. Whyte], Plazas need specific elements to unlock the potential of an area for proper utilization and enjoyment. The Robson Square experience is considered successful, from a designer's point of view, because it follows Whyte's [Street Life Project] guidelines.
The complex was completed in three stages at a cost of $139 million. The provincial government offices were finished first in 1978, the Law Courts the following year, and the renovation of the old provincial court building into the new Vancouver Art Gallery was completed in 1983, a decade after the design was started.As of November 23, 2009, Robson Square has been reopened following a multimillion-dollar reconstruction project. Its reopening can be directly attributed to the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver and Whistler. Robson Square provides the only public outdoor skating rink in Vancouver--and is free to use. The rink area is used in the milder months for various public events including Ballroom & Salsa dancing and is the hub for Vancouver's street-dance scene. As noted above, the skating rink is open in the winter; admission is free and skate rentals are $4.00.


== Awards and criticism ==
The architecture and landscape architecture have received acclaim for excellence in design.

In 2011 the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada  (RAIC) awarded its Prix du XXe siècle Award to the complex, describing the concept of a ""linear urban park, importing nature into the city"", as ""a bold, contemplative work of urban design.""
In 1982 the RAIC's awarded the Governor General's Gold Medal to the complex.
In 1979 The American Society of Landscape Architects awarded its President's Award for Excellence, noting the project's  ""extraordinary integration of landscape architecture with architecture"".As in much of Alvar Aalto's architecture, large and complex buildings may be rendered as though they were natural extensions of the topography in which they are situated. This paradigm was surely the primary motivation behind Arthur Erickson's Robson Square development, Vancouver (1983), wherein a megastructure comprising law courts and municipal offices was integrated with a parking garage in such a way as to assume the profile of a stepped escarpment. This last, laid out to the designs of the landscape architect Cornelia Oberlander, features an ornamental sheet of water 90 metres (300 feet) long that cascades over the large plate-glass picture window enclosing the registry office. This artificial architectonic earthwork running through the centre of Vancouver has since been confirmed as a main spine within the city by the medium-rise towers that have grown up around its axis spontaneously over the last decade. In this regard Robson Square has served as an urban catalyst in much the same way as the Rockefeller Center drew the fabric of Manhattan around itself at the end of the 1930s.
One of the main points of accessibility that this plaza has offered its users is an entry feature called the Robson Square Steps. This design has been highly utilized and considered a great achievement of the designer, Arthur Erikson. 
In 2017, local sources called into question the safety of the Robson Square Steps. The steepness of the steps is argued by few as a safety hazard. Additionally, the visually impaired are referenced in the safety concerns of this 40-year-old ramp and stairway design combination.

3,Hotel Vancouver,"The Fairmont Hotel Vancouver, formerly and still informally called the Hotel Vancouver, is a historic hotel in Vancouver, British Columbia. Located along West Georgia Street the hotel is situated within the city's Financial District, in Downtown Vancouver. The hotel was designed by two architects, John Smith Archibald, and John Schofield. The hotel is presently managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts.
Opened in May 1939, the Châteauesque-styled building is considered one of Canada's grand railway hotels. The hotel stands 112.47-metre-tall (369.0 ft), and contains 17 floors. It was the tallest building in Vancouver until the completion of TD Tower in 1972.


== Location ==
Hotel Vancouver sits at 900 West Georgia Street, within the Financial District, the central business district of Downtown Vancouver. The hotel property is bounded by Burrard Street to the northwest, West Georgia Street to the northeast, and Hornby Street to the southeast. To the southwest, the hotel property is bounded by two buildings, including 750 Burrard Street.
The hotel is located close to several attractions in downtown Vancouver. The hotel is situated directly northwest of the Vancouver Art Gallery, as well as Robson Square, a public square adjacent to the art museum. North of the hotel also lies Christ Church Cathedral, the oldest church in the city. The hotel is also situated near two SkyTrain rapid transit stations, Burrard station, and Vancouver City Centre station.


== Design ==


=== Architecture ===

Hotel Vancouver is one of Canada's grand railway hotels, initially built by Canadian National Railway. The building was designed by Canadian architects, John Smith Archibald, and John Schofield. Although construction for the hotel began in 1929, its completion would not occur until 1939 as a result of funding issues during Great Depression. The completion of the hotel required a joint investment into the property from Canadian Pacific Hotels, a division of Canadian Pacific Railway.The hotel was a part of series of Chateauesque grand railway hotels built throughout Canada in the late-19th and early 20th centuries. Like the other grand railway hotels, Hotel Vancouver incorporates elements from chateaus found in France's Loire Valley. Chateauesque features found on Hotel Vancouver includes its prominent copper pitched roof with dormers, and carved stonework encompassing a steel frame. In addition to chateauesque elements found on most grand railway hotels, Hotel Vancouver also incorporates Renaissance architectural detailings, gargoyles, and relief sculptures. In 1939, a number of artists were commissioned to complete the decorative work for the building, including Olea Marion Davis, Charles Marega, Beatrice Lennie, Valentine Shabief, and Lilias Farley.Hotel Vancouver stands 112.47-metre-tall (369.0 ft), containing 17 floors made up of guest rooms and other hotel amenities. After the building was completed in 1939, it became the tallest building in Vancouver until the completion of TD Tower in 1972.


=== Facilities ===

The Fairmont Hotel Vancouver includes 557 guest rooms and suites spread throughout the hotel. Suites at Hotel Vancouver include the Lieutenant Governor's Suite and the Royal Suite. The Lieutenant Governor's Suite was designed with Art Deco stylings, and features black walnut veneer-panelled walls.In 2018, the hotel announced the completion of its four-year renovation project, which saw a reworked main lobby, and guest rooms. The project also restored the 14th floor of the hotel to its original decor from 1939. Restored items on the 14th floor include English harewood doors with bronze doorplates, bronze hallway doors, sapele-panelled walls with bronze strips at its elevator lobby.In addition to lodgings, the hotel also houses several food-based services, as well as a restaurant, Notch8 Restaurant + Bar. The restaurant also hosts the hotel's afternoon tea service. Other facilities at the hotel include a gym, swimming pool, and spa.


== History ==
Plans to develop a railway hotel at the present site of Hotel Vancouver first emerged in the 1920s, from Canadian Northern Railway. In 1929 work on the present Hotel Vancouver commenced for Canadian National Railway. Canadian National Railway built the hotel as a result of a land deal between the city, and Canadian Northern Railway, a company later acquired by Canadian National Railway. The land deal required the city to prepare tidal flats on False Creek for the construction of railway yards and Pacific Central Station. In return, the company guaranteed the construction of a large downtown hotel, and make the city the western terminus for its rail network.Shortly after the erection of the building's steel frame however, work on the hotel was halted, as a result of the Great Depression. Work did not resume on the building until 1937, when Canadian National Railway partnered with Canadian Pacific Railway to complete the new hotel. Work on the hotel was rushed to completion in time for King George VI and Queen Elizabeth's 1939 royal tour of Canada. The hotel was the third hotel in the city to use the name ""Hotel Vancouver"". The first and second Hotel Vancouver were both located southeast of the present hotel on West Georgia Street. In an effort to prevent competition with the new Hotel Vancouver, Canadian Pacific Railway, closed its hotel operations at the second Hotel Vancouver once the new hotel opened. The second Hotel Vancouver building was torn down in 1949, after Canadian Pacific sold the property to Eaton's in December 1948.During the mid-20th century, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio stations were located within Hotel Vancouver. On 1 May 1940, Dal Richards began his career playing in an 11-piece band and a then-unknown 13-year-old Juliette at the hotel's Panorama Roof Ballroom, an event space at Hotel Vancouver. Richard became a regular performer for The Roof, a CBC Radio show broadcast from the hotel.
In 1962, Canadian National Hotels, a division of Canadian National Railway, acquired Canadian Pacific Hotels' share of the property, gaining full ownership of the hotel. From 1963 to 1983, the hotel was managed by Hilton Hotels & Resorts. Canadian National Hotels resumed management of the hotel in 1983, after its management contract with Hilton ended. In 1988 Canadian National Hotels sold its remaining nine properties, including Hotel Vancouver, to Canadian Pacific Hotels.

In 2001, Canadian Pacific Hotels was reorganized as Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, adopting the name from an American company it had purchased in 1999. The hotel's name was changed to the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver as a part of this re-branding effort. In 2007 Fairmont Hotels and Resorts sold 25 hotel properties, including Hotel Vancouver, to Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, although Fairmont continues to manage the hotel. In 2015, the property was sold to Larco Enterprise for C$180 million.In preparation for the building's 80th anniversary, the hotel underwent a C$12 million renovation of the hotel lobby, restaurant, and guest rooms. The renovations took place from 2014 to 2018.

4,TD Tower (Vancouver),"The Fairmont Hotel Vancouver, formerly and still informally called the Hotel Vancouver, is a historic hotel in Vancouver, British Columbia. Located along West Georgia Street the hotel is situated within the city's Financial District, in Downtown Vancouver. The hotel was designed by two architects, John Smith Archibald, and John Schofield. The hotel is presently managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts.
Opened in May 1939, the Châteauesque-styled building is considered one of Canada's grand railway hotels. The hotel stands 112.47-metre-tall (369.0 ft), and contains 17 floors. It was the tallest building in Vancouver until the completion of TD Tower in 1972.


== Location ==

The hotel is also situated near two SkyTrain rapid transit stations, Burrard station, and Vancouver City Centre station.


== Design ==


=== Architecture ===

Hotel Vancouver is one of Canada's grand railway hotels, initially built by Canadian National Railway. The building was designed by Canadian architects, John Smith Archibald, and John Schofield. Although construction for the hotel began in 1929, its completion would not occur until 1939 as a result of funding issues during Great Depression. The completion of the hotel required a joint investment into the property from Canadian Pacific Hotels, a division of Canadian Pacific Railway.The hotel was a part of series of Chateauesque grand railway hotels built throughout Canada in the late-19th and early 20th centuries. Like the other grand railway hotels, Hotel Vancouver incorporates elements from chateaus found in France's Loire Valley. Chateauesque features found on Hotel Vancouver includes its prominent copper pitched roof with dormers, and carved stonework encompassing a steel frame. In addition to chateauesque elements found on most grand railway hotels, Hotel Vancouver also incorporates Renaissance architectural detailings, gargoyles, and relief sculptures. In 1939, a number of artists were commissioned to complete the decorative work for the building, including Olea Marion Davis, Charles Marega, Beatrice Lennie, Valentine Shabief, and Lilias Farley.Hotel Vancouver stands 112.47-metre-tall (369.0 ft), containing 17 floors made up of guest rooms and other hotel amenities. After the building was completed in 1939, it became the tallest building in Vancouver until the completion of TD Tower in 1972.


=== Facilities ===

The Fairmont Hotel Vancouver includes 557 guest rooms and suites spread throughout the hotel. Suites at Hotel Vancouver include the Lieutenant Governor's Suite and the Royal Suite. The Lieutenant Governor's Suite was designed with Art Deco stylings, and features black walnut veneer-panelled walls.In 2018, the hotel announced the completion of its four-year renovation project, which saw a reworked main lobby, and guest rooms. The project also restored the 14th floor of the hotel to its original decor from 1939. Restored items on the 14th floor include English harewood doors with bronze doorplates, bronze hallway doors, sapele-panelled walls with bronze strips at its elevator lobby.In addition to lodgings, the hotel also houses several food-based services, as well as a restaurant, Notch8 Restaurant + Bar. The restaurant also hosts the hotel's afternoon tea service. Other facilities at the hotel include a gym, swimming pool, and spa.


== History ==
Plans to develop a railway hotel at the present site of Hotel Vancouver first emerged in the 1920s, from Canadian Northern Railway. In 1929 work on the present Hotel Vancouver commenced for Canadian National Railway. Canadian National Railway built the hotel as a result of a land deal between the city, and Canadian Northern Railway, a company later acquired by Canadian National Railway. The land deal required the city to prepare tidal flats on False Creek for the construction of railway yards and Pacific Central Station. In return, the company guaranteed the construction of a large downtown hotel, and make the city the western terminus for its rail network.Shortly after the erection of the building's steel frame however, work on the hotel was halted, as a result of the Great Depression. Work did not resume on the building until 1937, when Canadian National Railway partnered with Canadian Pacific Railway to complete the new hotel. Work on the hotel was rushed to completion in time for King George VI and Queen Elizabeth's 1939 royal tour of Canada. The hotel was the third hotel in the city to use the name ""Hotel Vancouver"". The first and second Hotel Vancouver were both located southeast of the present hotel on West Georgia Street. In an effort to prevent competition with the new Hotel Vancouver, Canadian Pacific Railway, closed its hotel operations at the second Hotel Vancouver once the new hotel opened. The second Hotel Vancouver building was torn down in 1949, after Canadian Pacific sold the property to Eaton's in December 1948.During the mid-20th century, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio stations were located within Hotel Vancouver. On 1 May 1940, Dal Richards began his career playing in an 11-piece band and a then-unknown 13-year-old Juliette at the hotel's Panorama Roof Ballroom, an event space at Hotel Vancouver. Richard became a regular performer for The Roof, a CBC Radio show broadcast from the hotel.
In 1962, Canadian National Hotels, a division of Canadian National Railway, acquired Canadian Pacific Hotels' share of the property, gaining full ownership of the hotel. From 1963 to 1983, the hotel was managed by Hilton Hotels & Resorts. Canadian National Hotels resumed management of the hotel in 1983, after its management contract with Hilton ended. In 1988 Canadian National Hotels sold its remaining nine properties, including Hotel Vancouver, to Canadian Pacific Hotels.

In 2001, Canadian Pacific Hotels was reorganized as Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, adopting the name from an American company it had purchased in 1999. The hotel's name was changed to the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver as a part of this re-branding effort. In 2007 Fairmont Hotels and Resorts sold 25 hotel properties, including Hotel Vancouver, to Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, although Fairmont continues to manage the hotel. In 2015, the property was sold to Larco Enterprise for C$180 million.In preparation for the building's 80th anniversary, the hotel underwent a C$12 million renovation of the hotel lobby, restaurant, and guest rooms. The renovations took place from 2014 to 2018.

6,750 Burrard Street,"750 Burrard Street (also known as 969 Robson Street, or ""Robson Central"") is a building in Downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, at the northeast corner of Robson Street and Burrard Street.
The site was home of the main branch of the Vancouver Public Library from 1957 to 1995. In December 1996, Canada's first (and ultimately only) Virgin Megastore opened on the lower level; Virgin eventually decided to exit the Canadian market and sold the location to HMV in September 2005. In late 2011, HMV Canada, now separately owned by Hilco UK, announced plans to close the Burrard location in January 2012 as part of a corporate refocusing towards smaller locations. HMV closed at this location on January 23, 2012.
The southeast corner of the building was also the first Planet Hollywood in Vancouver opened on March 16, 1997.  The main entrance was on 969 Robson Street.  It was closed in October 1999 after bankruptcy.The upper levels were taken over in fall 1997 as studios for the newly launched independent TV station VTV. The station later became part of the CTV Television Network (now owned by Bell Media), and the site now serves as Bell Media's west coast headquarters. The site selection, and much of the VTV format, had been inspired by Toronto station City and the iconic downtown studios that were at the time synonymous with the station. Incidentally, CTV would later acquire the Toronto building in question (but not City TV).
The Globe and Mail, which was co-owned with CTV from 2001 to 2010, later moved its Vancouver offices into part of CTV's space; its offices remain in the building despite no longer sharing common ownership with CTV. Later, radio stations 94.5 Virgin Radio, 103.5 QMFM, TSN Radio 1040 and TSN Radio 1410 (now BNN Bloomberg Radio 1410), all co-owned with CTV since 2007, also moved into the building. In the early 2010s, CTV reduced its space so that its offices are no longer directly accessible from Burrard Street; though it remains in the same building, it now uses the address 969 Robson Street.
Besides Bell Media and the Globe, current occupants include a flagship Victoria's Secret / Pink store, as well as a Clearly Contacts retail store.

9,Downtown Vancouver,"Downtown Vancouver is the southeastern portion of the peninsula in the north-central part of the City of Vancouver. It is the main city centre and central business district of the city, Metro Vancouver, and the Lower Mainland regions.


== Geography ==

The downtown area is generally considered to be bounded by Burrard Inlet to the north, Stanley Park and the West End to the west, False Creek to the south, and the Downtown Eastside to the east. Most sources include the full downtown peninsula (adding the West End neighbourhood and Stanley Park) as downtown Vancouver, but the City of Vancouver defines them as separate neighbourhoods.
Besides the readily identifiable office towers of the financial and central business districts, Downtown Vancouver also includes residential neighbourhoods in the form of high-rise apartment and condominiums, in Yaletown and Coal Harbour. Other downtown neighbourhoods include the Granville Mall and Entertainment District, Downtown's South, Gastown, Japantown, and Chinatown.


== Demographics ==


== Architecture ==

The downtown area includes most of the remaining historic buildings and many of the larger notable buildings in the region. All but one of Vancouver's tallest buildings are located within Downtown Vancouver, the one being Marine Gateway North located next to Marine Drive station.


=== Sports ===
There are two major sporting facilities in the downtown core, Rogers Arena (formerly GM Place) and BC Place Stadium. The NHL's Vancouver Canucks play at Rogers Arena, while the CFL's BC Lions and the MLS's Vancouver Whitecaps FC use the neighbouring BC Place Stadium. SkyTrain Stadium-Chinatown station provides easy rapid transit access to the district.


== Transportation ==

The presence of water on three sides limits access to downtown Vancouver. There are four major bridges: the Lions Gate Bridge, connecting to the North Shore municipalities and the Trans Canada Highway, and the Burrard Street Bridge, Cambie Street Bridge, and Granville Street Bridge, which provide access to the commercial and residential areas south of False Creek.
The historic Waterfront station is the principal transit hub for the downtown core. There are six subway stations located in downtown Vancouver running on two SkyTrain lines: the Expo Line and Canada Line. The Expo Line travels from Waterfront station at the foot of the central harbor and through Dunsmuir Tunnel to the east. The Canada Line travels from Waterfront station and tunnels south under Granville Street and Davie Street, linking downtown to central Richmond and Vancouver International Airport. SeaBus is a passenger-only ferry that connects from Waterfront station to the North Shore in 10–12 minutes. The West Coast Express commuter rail system travels from Waterfront station to the eastern suburbs and exurbs. The West Coast Express travels from Waterfront to Moody Centre, Coquitlam Central, Port Coquitlam, Pitt Meadows, Maple Meadows Station, Port Haney and Mission City as its terminus station Terminals are also available near Waterfront station for float planes and helicopters. 

Most north-south Vancouver bus routes serve Downtown Vancouver, in addition to suburban routes from the North Shore and Burnaby. The bus rapid transit line 98 B-Line had eight stops in the downtown core, primarily along Seymour Street and Burrard Street. This service was replaced on August 17, 2009 by SkyTrain's Canada Line. The 95 B-Line started service in December 2016 in conjunction with the opening of the Evergreen Extension, connecting downtown to Simon Fraser University along Hastings Street.
There are two private passenger water taxi operators (False Creek Ferries and The Aquabus), providing service between several downtown neighbourhoods, False Creek, and Granville Island.
The city is planning to extend the downtown streetcar from its current route of Granville Island to the Main Street SkyTrain station, with future plans extending it to Chinatown and then to Stanley Park.

10,Anglican Diocese of New Westminster,"The Diocese of New Westminster is one of five dioceses of the Ecclesiastical Province of British Columbia and the Yukon of the Anglican Church of Canada. The see city is Vancouver. The current bishop is Melissa Skelton. Skelton was consecrated and installed March 1, 2014. She is the ninth bishop of the diocese, the first woman, the first American and the first person who had a previous career prior to ordination to the priesthood to be elected bishop of the 140-year-old diocese. On May 12, 2018, Melissa Skelton was elected Metropolitan of the Ecclesiastical Province of BC/Yukon which includes the title of Archbishop. Melissa M. Skelton was the first woman to be elected archbishop in the Anglican Church of Canada and the second woman to have that title throughout the world wide Anglican Communion. The Dean of New Westminster and Rector of the Cathedral Church, Christ Church, is Christopher Pappas and the Executive Archdeacon of the Diocese is G. Douglas Fenton.
The diocese encompasses about 78,000 square kilometres of the Lower Mainland in the civil province of British Columbia, comprising the Regional Districts of Metro Vancouver, Fraser Valley, Sunshine Coast, Powell River and part of the Regional District of Squamish-Lillooet (including  Squamish and Whistler).
The diocese was founded in New Westminster in 1879, but with the phenomenal growth of the City of Vancouver, the see city was moved there in 1912. There are, therefore, two churches styled as ""cathedrals"" in the diocese — Christ Church Cathedral in Vancouver has been the cathedral since 1929, while Holy Trinity Cathedral in New Westminster was the cathedral from 1892 to that date. Although no longer a cathedral, the Diocesan Synod allowed Holy Trinity to keep the title ""cathedral"" as a courtesy for historical reasons (it is, strictly speaking, a pro-cathedral).
The diocese has 66 active parishes and 3 emerging faith communities with approximately 18,000 members on its parish rolls according to the recent statistics stated in the official publication Topic.
The diocese has traditionally been at the forefront of progressive causes in the Anglican Communion. In 1976, David Somerville was one of the first bishops of the Canadian Church to ordain women. In 2002, the diocese became the centre of an international controversy within the Anglican Communion due to its decision to bless same-sex unions. Several conservative ecclesiastical provinces in the Communion, particularly those in Africa, have severed relations with the diocese over the issue (see Homosexuality and the Anglican Communion).
At the May 11, 2016 meeting of Diocesan Council the governing body of the Diocese of New Westminster, Council unanimously passed the following motion:
That Diocesan Council, on behalf of the Diocese of New Westminster:
I.	Accept the invitation of the Episcopal Diocese of Northern Philippines to enter into a companion relationship seeking opportunities for prayer, mutual learning, and witness to the gospel (the ""Companion Relationship"");
II.	undertake an annual evaluation of the Companion Relationship to ensure that the Companion Relationship satisfies the mutual goals of the two dioceses (the ""Annual Evaluations""); and
III.	ask the Bishop to appoint members from the Diocese of New Westminster to a joint-diocesan working group to oversee the Companion Relationship and to undertake the Annual Evaluations. Bishop Brent Alawas of the Episcopal Diocese of Northern Philippines] travelled from Bontoc to Vancouver on May 12, 2016 and was present as a guest speaker at the diocesan mission conference on May 14, 2016
The diocesan offices, gathering space, meeting rooms and archives are located at 1410 Nanton Avenue in the Shaughnessy section of the City of Vancouver, BC. V6H 2E2


== Coat of arms and badge ==
The Coat of Arms and Badge are both official marks for the diocese. In practice, the crest is generally used more when the bishop is involved directly, and the badge when specifically referencing only the diocese.
The Coat of Arms, with much history behind it, was acquired by Bishop Gower in 1960. It strongly references that of Westminster Abbey, London, UK.
The Badge (a blue circle, gold cross and birds over white wave) was created for the diocesan Communications Committee with the help of Robert Watt, Chief Herald of Canada and officially adopted at the 2007 Diocesan Synod
See the complete description of the Badge, comparison of the Coat of Arms and Badge and Permitted Usage
The badge is a proper heraldic symbol for use on diocesan and parish materials. It incorporates key elements of the diocesan Coat of Arms, but is less detailed, and the Badge is easier to reproduce properly than the very detailed Coat of Arms.

11,Christ Church Cathedral (Vancouver),"Christ Church Cathedral in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, is the second cathedral church of the Anglican Diocese of New Westminster of the Anglican Church of Canada. A place of worship in Greater Vancouver, the cathedral is located at 690 Burrard Street on the north-east corner of West Georgia Street and Burrard Street, directly across from the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver.


== History ==
Christ Church is a daughter church of St. James' Anglican Church. The first service was held, without a church building, on December 23, 1888, at 720 Granville Street. On February 14, 1889, a building committee was formed to collect the necessary funds for the erection of the church. It would be located on land bought from the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR); Henry John Cambie, chief engineer of CPR's Pacific Division and People's Warden of the new church, was a key negotiator in acquiring the property.By October 1889, Christ Church's basement was built and on October 6, the opening service was held for 52 parishioners. The joy of a new church did not last forever. By 1891 the CPR objected to the unfinished building that had quickly been nicknamed the root house. It was viewed an ""eyesore"" and the parishioners feared they would lose their location due to lack of funds to complete the building. The architect
Robert Mackay Fripp submitted a proposal for completion of the church, 1892.A financing scheme was developed by a parishioner and the cornerstone was finally laid July 28, 1894, and the church dedicated on February 17, 1895. The church was built in the Gothic Style with ceiling made of cedar planking and ceiling beams and floor constructed out of old growth Douglas fir. By 1909 the first expansion was done and by 1911, the first organ had already worn out. It used a human blower hired at $5 per month and was replaced by a new organ manufactured by Wurlitzer. 

In 1920, electricity replaced candles for lighting, and in 1930 the lanterns now in the church were installed.In 1929, the Archbishop of New Westminster constituted Christ Church as the Cathedral Church of the Diocese replacing Holy Trinity Cathedral located in the City of New Westminster. The church planned to build a bell tower, but in 1943, the city by-laws were changed to restrict church bells. In November 2016, a bell tower was inaugurated. Its four bells are rung daily at 8 am and 6 pm and before church services.In 1949, after many building alterations, the Casavant organ was installed. Constructed partially of war surplus parts and remnants of the Wurlitzer, the instrument served well but had a problematic history.In 1971, the church membership voted to demolish the building and replace it with a hi-rise tower complex designed by Arthur Erickson. The redevelopment was opposed by the public and in 1976 after much lobbying; the cathedral was named a Class A Heritage building in the municipality of Vancouver and the Province of British Columbia.In 1995, an eleven-year program of restoration and renewal was begun. Christ Church Cathedral is the Regimental Church of the Seaforth Highlanders and is in the process of being designated Regimental Church of the BC Regiment, Duke of Connaught's Own.
Bishop Michael Ingham authorized a liturgy for the celebration of lesbian and gay covenants in December 2002. Christ Church Cathedral's Annual Vestry meeting in February 2003 gave approval for the ministry to be offered as part of the parish's pastoral care for the community. The spring and fall of 2004 saw the installation of a Kenneth Jones tracker organ in the south gallery of the renovated Cathedral. Comprising a three manual console and 2500 pipes, 1700 salvaged from the Casavant, it is the first Christ Church Cathedral organ custom built to speak with optimum effect in the sanctuary.On September 25, 2014, the parish submitted ""A Statement in Favour of the Solemnization of Same Sex Matrimony in the Anglican Church of Canada"" to the Anglican Church of Canada's commission on the marriage canon. This statement was submitted by the cathedral's clergy, wardens and parish council.


== Worship ==

Holy Communion is celebrated using both the Book of Common Prayer and the Book of Alternative Services. Both a simple spoken celebration and a choral or sung eucharist celebrated with congregational hymns featuring an eclectic mix of Mass settings, psalmody, anthems and instrumental music are practised. Music in worship ranges from plainsong to motets from the baroque and classical periods to contemporary and world music. Cathedral musician, Rupert Lang is a prolific and respected composer and many of his sacred pieces debut during this liturgy.
The cathedral clergy share preaching duties at services with guest preachers booked throughout the year. Guest preachers in the recent past have included a former Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, and the noted environmental scientist David Suzuki. It is also the church at which the royal family worships when in Vancouver.In May 2014, the cathedral formed St. Brigids, an emerging Christian community rooted in the Anglican tradition. The community identifies with the Emerging Church movement.


== Deans of New Westminster ==
Holy Trinity Cathedral in New Westminster formerly housed the Dean of New Westminster, until that seat was moved to Christ Church Cathedral in Vancouver in 1929. The following is a list of Deans of New Westminster since 1929:


== Heraldry ==
The Celtic Cross, which is found on both the Cathedral's exterior and interior, represents the roots of the Anglican Communion in the British Isles. The spindle whorl and the three salmon in the style of the Coast Salish Nation, represent the First People of Canada and the original inhabitants of the west coast.
The Greek letters Chi (X) and Rho (P) in the centre are the initials of the words Christus Rex, Christ the King. The motto is ""I hold before you an open door"" (Revelation 3:8), the title of the first sermon preached in the Cathedral by the Rector, the Rev. H. B. Hobson, December 23, 1888.

13,Hotel Vancouver (1916),"The Hotel Vancouver, the second of three by that name, was a 15 story (77m) Italian Renaissance style hotel built in 1916 by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The architect was Francis S. Swales.
The hotel closed in 1939, when an arrangement was made with rival Canadian National Railway (CNR) to jointly operate CNR's new hotel, located two blocks away. That hotel, which took over the name Hotel Vancouver, is still operating today. The 1916 CPR building survived until 1949 when it was demolished by the Eaton's department store chain.


== Famous Guests ==
Many famous people stayed at this hotel, including Winston Churchill, Sarah Bernhardt, Babe Ruth, Ethel Barrymore, and Anna Pavlova. It was also much loved by the people of Vancouver, who made its rooftop dining room and dance floor, the Panorama Roof, a favourite place for a night out.


== Structure and Location ==
The structure was one of the triumvirate of large, ornate buildings which anchored the centre of town at Georgia and Granville streets: the Hudson Bay Store, Birks Building, and Hotel Vancouver.  Only the Hudson Bay store remains of those three jewels of the city's golden age of Edwardian architecture.  Also attached to the hotel and built by the CPR was the Vancouver Opera House, later an Orpheum theatre, the city's first. It had become the Lyric Theatre by the time it was demolished to make way for the construction of Pacific Centre.
The site is one of the highest points in the downtown peninsula, good for an imposing building, a fact not lost on the Canadian Pacific.
The upstart Canadian Northern wanted to impress the town to further its rivalry with the Canadian Pacific. To this end, the east side of False Creek was filled in to expand rail yards and situate a Beaux Arts railway station. Once flanked by a much more elaborate Great Northern station, since demolished, the Pacific Central Station still stands today. In an agreement with the city, the Canadian Northern promised to build a new hotel. However, the First World War and the insolvency of the Canadian Northern Railway delayed the start of the project; the successor Canadian National began construction in 1928. The Great Depression delayed the opening of the third Hotel Vancouver until 1939. Money to complete the hotel was finally provided by the Canadian government in 1937 as an unemployment relief projet in the dark days of the Depression. Fearing the market was not large enough for competing hotels, the railways agreed to a joint CP-CN hotel as a condition of the completion.


== World War II ==
During the Second World War, the second Hotel Vancouver was used as a barracks. The building was boarded up and placed under guard at the end of the war, a time when returning veterans were having difficulty finding housing. In January 1946 thirty-five veterans, unimpeded by Army sentries, took over the vacant hotel and announced the building was now veterans housing. They organized themselves and soon were housing approximately 1,000 veterans and some spouses.
The building was used by the veterans until 1948 and torn down a year later. The block became a parking lot until 1969.  The Pacific Centre, including the TD Tower and the main Vancouver Eaton's Store (now Nordstrom), was constructed between 1969 and 1973 and stands on the site today.


== Media depictions ==
The hotel was recreated in virtual form in the 2014 interactive work Circa 1948.

14,Pacific Centre,"Pacific Centre (corporately styled as CF Pacific Centre) is a shopping mall located in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and managed by Cadillac Fairview. Based on the number of stores, most of which are underground, it is the largest mall in Downtown Vancouver with over 100 stores and shops and the 7th busiest mall in Canada with 22.1 million annual visitors as of 2018. The mall is directly connected to the Hudson's Bay department store, Vancouver Centre Mall, two SkyTrain subway stations, and the Four Seasons Hotel Vancouver.


== History ==
Built between 1971 and 1973, it was an unofficial Eaton Centre. The Pacific Centre was home to an Eaton's department store, succeeded by Sears Canada after 2002 and vacated in the fall of 2012. A Nordstrom store opened in its former space in 2015.
The City of Vancouver approved a 578,000 sq ft. expansion of Pacific Centre, including retail premises that will extend to the street on both sides of West Georgia Street, and a direct link connecting the shopping centre with the new Vancouver City Centre SkyTrain station on Granville Street. The link opened in the summer of 2009 in conjunction with the opening of the Canada Line.
In November 2012, B.C. attorney general Shirley Bond ordered an investigation into a Downtown Vancouver Business Improvement Association (DVBIA) security guard, who had physically assaulted a person with a disability whom he had accused of shoplifting. During the altercation, which was recorded on security cameras and witnesses' cellphones, the guard was seen hitting the man, throwing him from his wheelchair, and yelling profanities at him. In January 2013, the Ministry of Justice ruled that the guard had used unnecessary force. He was fined $230, and had his security license suspended for two month with a condition requiring re-certification on use of force before he could receive his license.On January 20, 2017, Cadillac Fairview announced an agreement to sell a 50 percent interest in its Vancouver properties, including Pacific Centre, to the Ontario Pension Board and Ontario's Workplace Safety and Insurance Board, each to hold a 25% stake. Cadillac Fairview, itself a subsidiary of the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, will retain the remaining 50% interest and continue to manage the properties.

16,Scotia Tower,"Scotia Tower is a prominent skyscraper located at 650 West Georgia Street in Downtown Vancouver.
The 15th tallest building in the city, it stands at 138 m or 35 storeys tall and completed in 1977 and is a landmark skyscraper near the end of the central business district. The building houses Scotiabank operations for British Columbia and the underground Vancouver Centre, with its various shops and attendant street retail and theatres. The malls are linked to Pacific Centre and Hudson's Bay and a SkyTrain subway station via subterranean passages beneath Georgia and Granville Streets.
The Georgia and Granville corner of the site was the former location of the Birk's Store in Vancouver, an ornate Edwardian edifice that was torn down in 1974 to make way for construction of the Scotia Tower and Vancouver Centre.  Birk's was the first tenant in the new corner-retail location after the Centre's construction but has since moved to Granville and West Hastings; that location is now the main downtown store of London Drugs.
The Georgia Street side of the Scotia Tower-Vancouver Centre was the location of the old Strand Theatre, the only one of Vancouver's Theatre Row not directly on Granville Street. That movie house was later replaced by the Vancouver Centre Cinemas (now closed) in 1977.

20,"Granville Mall, Vancouver","The Granville Mall is a transit mall and pedestrian zone in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It comprises the section of Granville Street in Downtown Vancouver between Hastings and Smithe streets. Most routes that service the mall are primarily trolleybuses operated by TransLink; in addition to bus service, the Granville Mall can be accessed by SkyTrain from either Granville and Vancouver City Centre stations of the Expo and Canada lines, respectively.


== History ==

The idea of closing off a section of Granville Street to automobile traffic arose after the city withdrew its freeway plan in 1968 due to community opposition. The city concluded that automobile use within downtown should be restricted in order to avoid overloading the area's street network, and subsequently designated the section of Granville between Hastings and Nelson streets a pedestrian and transit mall. The Granville Mall opened for service on September 15, 1974.The Downtown Vancouver Association sought to re-open Granville between Nelson and Georgia streets to general traffic, and the city proceeded with that proposal in 1987 on a trial basis. The trial was declared unsuccessful and cancelled the following year, although the city did re-open one block between Nelson and Smithe streets to general traffic in 1989, widening the section to four lanes.On April 24, 2006, the mall between Robson Street and Hastings Street was closed to all traffic, including transit buses, to allow construction of the Canada Line subway and Vancouver City Centre station. During this closure, buses were re-routed to Seymour Street (northbound), Howe Street (southbound, routes crossing the Granville Street Bridge), and Richards Street (southbound, routes within downtown). As part of this construction, the 800, 600, and 500 blocks of Granville (between Smithe and Robson, and then again between Georgia and Pender) were open to all traffic, northbound, including on-street metered parking.
Before its closure, the Granville Mall was used by over 1,900 buses (90% electric trolleybuses) and 47,500+ transit riders on weekdays. Following studies and consultations, Vancouver City Council decided in the spring of 2006 to carry out a redesign of the mall after completion of the Canada Line subway under the street. Trolleybus service on the mall resumed on September 7, 2010; the buses continue to use Howe and Seymour streets in the evenings on weekends and holidays.


== Entertainment district ==

In somewhat of a contrast to the hustle and bustle of transit during the day, the centre portion of the Granville Mall and nearby streets play host to the city's primary urban retail and adult nightlife district after the evening rush hour. Known simply as the Granville Entertainment District contains countless bars, dance clubs, venues, restaurants, hotels, and shops with neon lights and a particularly urban gritty vibe are open daily until late into the night and extend to the wee hours of morning on weekends.  The entertainment district was created by city zoning policies, concentrating adult nightlife operations which had previously been scattered throughout the greater downtown peninsula.

In the week preceding this event posters were put up around town inviting people to a 'Riot at the Hyatt'. At the event crowds surrounded the hotel where Prime Minister Jean Chrétien was speaking. Vancouver police waded into the crowd of demonstrators and, according to critics, ""beat them with wooden nightsticks"".  Several young people were injured. The Vancouver police investigated the matter for over a year and eventually issued a report concluding that the victims’ complaints of excessive force were unsubstantiated.

== History ==
Tamura and his wife moved to Vancouver in 2005. They opened the first Japadog stand that same year. A second stand opened in Vancouver in the summer of 2009. As of March 2013, the company now has four locations in Vancouver and a fifth one in New York City (now closed). In 2014, they opened a sit-down store in Los Angeles, California. In addition to their three mobile stands in Vancouver, in 2010 they opened a sit-in restaurant, allowing them to serve extra items such as desserts and their unique french fries, called ""shaked fries."" The kitchen staff prepare them by placing the cooked fries in a paper bag and seasoning and shaking them until coated.

23,Granville Entertainment District,"The Granville Entertainment District is a neighbourhood in Downtown Vancouver known for its vast assortment of bars, danceclubs, restaurants, nightlife, and urban adult oriented shops and entertainment. The entertainment district centred on a seven-block stretch of the Granville Mall and surrounding streets.


== History ==

The Vancouver city council originally came up with the concept of having most of the downtown's drinking establishments centred in one area in the late 1990s. The initiative came with an extension of late night liquor service to 3:00am, and according to Vancouver Police reports, has resulted in a steady increase of assaults and calls for police assistance in the area.
Prior to the establishment of the current Entertainment District, in what is now the Granville Mall was home to a number of movie theatres, which gave that stretch of Granville Street the nickname ""Theatre Row"" for many years. The closure of those theatres over the years (and the conversion of some of them into their current nightclub forms), however, has left no more movie theatres still operating in the former Theatre Row area as of November 4, 2012 (the date of the closure of the last remaining theatre there, the Granville 7 Cinemas).


=== Former Theatre Row ===
Capitol, 820 Granville (1920-1974, 1977-2005 as Capitol 6; demolished for the Capitol Residences condominium tower)
Caprice, 965 Granville (1912-1967 as Dominion, 1967-1988 as Downtown, 1992-1999; now the Caprice Nightclub)
Colonial, 603 Granville (1929-1972; demolished for the second phase of Pacific Centre)
Granville 7, 855 Granville (1912-1938 as Globe, 1938-1964 as Paradise, 1964-1986 as Coronet, 1987-2012; was the last remaining cinema complex on Granville Street before its closure. Still under the name Granville 7, most recently owned and operated by Empire Theatres.)
Lyric, 765 Granville (1891 - 1907 as Vancouver Opera House, 1913-1927 Orpheum, 1927-1935 Vancouver Theater, 1935-1947 and 1964-1969, 1947-1960 as International Cinema; demolished to make way for Eatons Department Store, now location of Nordstrom.)
Orpheum, 884 Granville (1927-1975; concert hall and home of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra since 1977. Originally built as the New Orpheum)
Paradise, 919 Granville (1949-1972 and 1984-1989 as Studio, 1972-1978 as Eve, 1979-1981 as Lyric, 1981-1984 as Towne, 1989-1999; now the Studio Nightclub)

Vancouver Centre, 650 West Georgia at Granville (1977-2002; now used by JLS Business College) (although officially addressed to West Georgia Street, technically part of Theatre Row due to its proximity with Granville. It basically sat on the site of the Strand and old Birks Building)

25,Park Place (Vancouver),"Park Place is a signature skyscraper located at 666 Burrard Street in Downtown Vancouver's Financial District. Park Place has 35 storeys, and was completed in 1984. It stands at 140 m (459 ft) and is one of the tallest buildings in the city.


== Description ==

The building is located at the corner of Burrard Street and Dunsmuir Street, across the street from the Burrard SkyTrain station. Although the building only uses 35% of the site, at 64,856 square metres (698,100 sq ft) it is the largest office building in British Columbia. The rest of the site is dedicated to open green space, including water features and a small amphitheatre.
The Postmodern architecture of the building is expressed through its pink granite facade adorned with flush-mounted copper-glazed windows that mach the granite's appearance. The building bears many similarities to the Brookfield Place in New York City, which was constructed around the same time.
This building is rare in its use of the address 666, because of the negative connotations of that number in North American culture. However, in Chinese culture 666 is considered one of the luckiest numbers. The decision was likely motivated by the city's large population of Chinese Canadians and strong ties to China, especially Hong Kong.

26,Orpheum (Vancouver),"The Orpheum is a theatre and music venue in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Along with the Queen Elizabeth Theatre and the Vancouver Playhouse, it is part of the Vancouver Civic Theatres group of live performance venues. It is the permanent home of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. The Orpheum is located on Granville Street near Smithe Street in Vancouver's downtown core. The interior of the theatre was featured prominently in the award-winning 2004 reboot of Battlestar Galactica, where it is dressed to portray a heavenly opera house.


== History ==

Designed by Scottish architect Marcus Priteca, the theatre officially opened on November 8, 1927 as a vaudeville house, but it hosted its first shows the previous day. The old Orpheum, at 761 Granville Street, was renamed the Vancouver Theatre (later the Lyric, then the International Cinema, then the Lyric once more before it closed for demolition in 1969 to make way for the first phase of the Pacific Centre project). The New Orpheum, which was the biggest theatre in Canada when it opened in 1927, with three thousand seats, cost $1.25 million to construct. The first manager of the theatre was William A. Barnes.Following the end of vaudeville's heyday in the early 1930s, the Orpheum became primarily a movie house under Famous Players ownership, although it would continue to host live events on occasion. Ivan Ackery managed the Orpheum during most of this period, from 1935 up until his 1969 retirement.In 1973, for economic reasons, Famous Players decided to gut the inside of the Orpheum and change it into a multiplex. A ""Save the Orpheum"" public protest and fundraising campaign was launched, which even Jack Benny flew in to help with, and the Orpheum was saved.  On March 19, 1974, the City of Vancouver bought the theatre for $7.1 million, with $3.1 million coming from the city itself, and $1.5 million from each of the provincial and federal governments. The Orpheum closed on November 23, 1975 and a renovation and restoration was done by the architectural company Thomson, Berwick, Pratt and Partners. It re-opened on April 2, 1977 and has since been the permanent home of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. Tony Heinsbergen, a U.S. designer who originally chose the color scheme for the interior (ivory, moss green, gold and burgundy) was brought back, fifty years later, for the renovation. In 1983, an additional entrance was opened on Smithe Street.

The theatre was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1979. The Orpheum's present neon sign was installed during the 1970s, donated by to the theatre by Jim Pattison. The theatre and its neon sign have been used as a key location in several episodes of the science-fiction series Battlestar Galactica and Fringe, as well as Highlander: The Series. It was also the location of the filming of the Dan Mangan documentary What Happens Next? by Brent Hodge.
In 2006, the Capitol Residences development was proposed for the old Capitol 6 cinema site adjacent to the Orpheum. The City of Vancouver gave the developer permission for extra height and density on their site in return for a major expansion to the Orpheum, including a long desired back stage area. This was the largest amenities trade in the history of the city, and will increase the usability of the facility.

27,Granville station (SkyTrain),"Granville is an underground station on the Expo Line of Metro Vancouver's SkyTrain rapid transit system. The station is located in Downtown Vancouver on the portion of Granville Street that is known as the Granville Mall. The station is accessible from the surface via entrances on Granville Street and Seymour Street (both between Georgia and Dunsmuir streets), and the Dunsmuir entrance between Granville and Seymour.
The station serves the shopping and entertainment districts along Granville and Robson streets, as well as the office and shopping complexes of Pacific Centre and Vancouver Centre.  The station is also within walking distance of such amenities as Robson Square (home of the Vancouver Art Gallery, the Provincial Court of British Columbia, and a satellite campus of the University of British Columbia), the Orpheum Theatre, Vancouver Library Square, TD Tower, Scotia Tower and the HSBC Canada Building.


== History ==

Granville station opened in 1985 and is named for nearby Granville Street, which name is derived from ""Granville"", the name of the original settlement that preceded Vancouver prior to its incorporation in 1886. The Austrian architecture firm Architektengruppe U-Bahn was responsible for designing the station.On September 22, 2006, elevator access was introduced from Dunsmuir Street with the completion of the neighbouring Hudson on Granville development, and large signs were added at the platform level to guide passengers to the newly available elevators. The entrance has separate escalator access to the platform levels independent of the existing station in a similar two up/one down configuration for the longest bank, and a ticket-vending level with a connection to the existing Granville Mall entrance and the Hudson Bay / Pacific Centre shopping mall. There are retail spaces within the new addition's ticket vending lobby and in the passageway to Hudson Bay.
The design of the addition, its capacity, and connection to Granville Mall made it possible for the original facility to be closed entirely; however, it remained in full service. The original station area closed only temporarily for lighting upgrades from October 23, 2006, to mid-November.

On May 8, 2018, TransLink announced the Granville Station Escalator Replacement Project as part of the TransLink Maintenance and Repair Program. The replacement of six escalators began on May 26, 2018, resulting in the closure of the Seymour Street entrance and the closure of the Granville/Seymour concourse. On July 17, 2020, the escalators returned to service and the Seymour Street entrance was re-opened.


== Structure and design ==
Like Burrard station, the station was built inside the Dunsmuir Tunnel and has a distinctive platform design. The westbound track (to Waterfront) is stacked above the eastbound track (to King George and Production Way–University stations), with the westbound platform being one level above the eastbound platform. At approximately 25 metres (82 ft) underground, Granville station is the deepest subway station on the Expo Line.


== Services ==

Granville station is one of four SkyTrain stations on the Expo Line that serve Downtown Vancouver. It connects with many TransLink bus routes, including trolleybus routes on the Granville Mall and suburban bus routes (running on nearby Georgia Street) heading to and from North and West Vancouver. Passengers are able to transfer to the Canada Line (served by Vancouver City Centre station) by walking through Pacific Centre or Vancouver Centre and the Hudson Bay department store, although the only direct transfer point is at Waterfront station.
There is a small retail space standing at the bottom of the long escalator bank in the original station area, where the corridor splits into the westbound and eastbound routes. It is one of the few stores located entirely within a fare paid zone of any SkyTrain station.
Granville station is unique in being one of only a few stations having no surface entrance building of its own, independent of any adjacent buildings (Main Street–Science World station is another for example). The station has three entrances: Granville Mall through the Hudson’s Bay Company department store, Seymour Street with direct access to the ticketing platform, and Dunsmuir Street through the Hudson condominium development.

== Foundation and Locations ==
In 2004, Sprott Shaw Community College (SSC) decided to expand its educational offerings. The goal was to offer SSC graduates and others an easier way to obtain a BBA. After receiving the rights by the Minister of Advanced Education to offer the new degree, SSC had to differentiate the two schools. Sprott Shaw Degree College (SSD) was created with the intention of distinguishing itself from its vocational offerings. The first president was Dean Duperron. In 2007 the first Chancellor, the Honourable Brian Peckford was appointed.
Acsenda School of Management has had four campuses in its history. The first campus was located in Burnaby, then moved to West Georgia and Granville Street, then 1090 West Pender Street. Today, the Acsenda campus is located at 666 Burrard Street.


== Programs ==

29,Law Courts (Vancouver),"The Law Courts building is part of the landmark Robson Square complex in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  It was designed by renowned Canadian architect Arthur Erickson.  The Law Courts building occupies the southern block of the three city block complex, provincial government offices the middle block, and the Vancouver Art Gallery the northern block.  The building is used exclusively by the two higher courts of the Province of British Columbia: the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal.


== Background ==
The project began as The British Columbia Centre, a provincial government project to replace the neo-Classical courthouse forming the northern of the three Robson Square blocks which now houses the Vancouver Art Gallery.  The proposed 50-storey tower, at 208 metres (682 feet), would have been the tallest skyscraper in the city (and taller than the Living Shangri-La, which holds the record as of 2011). In 1972 the provincial government of WAC Bennett was defeated by the NDP government of Dave Barrett. Just as the tower's construction phase was about to begin the plan was scrapped and Arthur Erickson Architects was commissioned to create a new design in 1973.  The concept was revised into a ""horizontal highrise"", ""B.C. Centre on its back.""  The inspiration for this has been credited both to the architect and to the government minister responsible for the courts.  The building opened in 1980.


== Architecture ==
The building is a 7-storey structure housing 35 courtrooms and is 42 metres (138 ft) in height.  It is largely covered by a roof of green-tinted glass over a space-frame structure covering approximately 50,000 square feet (4,645 m2), more than one acre, of occupied space.  The entry and public circulation spaces are open to this roof, forming a large skylit indoor public atrium.  Access is directly from the street and by an upper-level walkway connecting to the Robson Square rooftop garden to the north, forming a three-block accessible-for-all roof integrated into the city core.  Its innovative architecture and urban design have been recognized as one of the world-renowned landmarks of downtown Vancouver, incorporating ""a style that remains connected to the surroundings, with a sensitivity for nature and the environment.""Erickson described his concept as: ""This won’t be a corporate monument. Let’s turn it on its side and let people walk all over it.""The tan-coloured concrete structure is exposed on the exterior and interior of the building.  The other main exterior material is green-tinted glass.  The late-modernist geometric form and hard materials are softened by an extensive use of landscaping around the building, in a series of horizontal planters terracing up from street level into the large public indoor atrium, and on the rooftop terrace.  The landscape design was undertaken in Erickson's office by landscape architect Cornelia Oberlander.  Incorporating trees and landscaping into a building was a new concept for Vancouver at the time.


== Awards ==
The architecture and landscape architecture have received acclaim for excellence in design.

In 2011 the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada  (RAIC) awarded its Prix du XXe siècle Award to the complex, describing the concept of a ""linear urban park, importing nature into the city"", as ""a bold, contemplative work of urban design.""
In 1982 the RAIC's awarded the Governor General's Gold Medal to the complex.
In 1979 The American Society of Landscape Architects awarded its President's Award for Excellence, noting the project's  ""extraordinary integration of landscape architecture with architecture"".

34,Burrard station,"Burrard is an underground station on the Expo Line of Metro Vancouver's SkyTrain rapid transit system. The station is located in Downtown Vancouver on Burrard Street, where Melville and Dunsmuir Streets meet, and is the western terminus of the R5 Hastings St that provides service to Simon Fraser University.
The station serves Vancouver's financial district and is within walking distance of the Coal Harbour and West End neighbourhoods. The station is accessible via the surface from Art Phillips Park or via the underground shopping centres of the Royal Centre and Bentall Centre skyscraper complexes.


== History ==
Burrard station opened in 1985 and is named for nearby Burrard Street, which in turn is named for Sir Harry Burrard-Neale. Prior to the opening of the Canada Line in 2009, Burrard station was the northern terminus of the 98 B-Line and was served by a number of bus routes that provided service to Vancouver's southern suburbs of Delta, Richmond, Surrey, and White Rock. In 2016, bus service to the eastern suburbs of the Tri-Cities was discontinued when the Millennium Line's Evergreen Extension opened.


== Structure and design ==
The structure housing the surface station entrance was designed to resemble Victorian-era British railway stations, with a peaked glass roof. The station was designed by the Austrian architecture firm Architektengruppe U-Bahn.When originally opened, the station's only underground passage was to the Bentall Centre skyscraper complex. A connection to the Royal Centre complex was constructed some years later, while an anticipated underground passage to the Park Place skyscraper across the street was never built. The construction of a new east entrance to the station, at the southeast corner of the intersection of Burrard and Dunsmuir, was considered as part of upgrades to the station included in TransLink's 10-Year Vision, but the cost of such an addition was higher than expected and TransLink turned to reviewing options to improve the existing entrance.Like Granville, the station was built inside the Dunsmuir Tunnel and has a distinctive platform design. The inbound track (to Waterfront) is stacked on top of the outbound track (to King George and Production Way–University), with the inbound platform being one level above the outbound platform.


== Services ==
Burrard station is one of four SkyTrain stations on the Expo Line that serve Downtown Vancouver. It has connections with many TransLink bus routes in Metro Vancouver; these buses serve the city of Vancouver, Burnaby, the city and district of North Vancouver, and West Vancouver.


== Station information ==


=== Station layout ===


=== Entrances ===
Burrard Street entrance: the main entrance for Burrard station, with connections to Royal Centre and Bentall Centre at concourse level. Three escalators are available between platform and concourse level, and 1 up-escalator between concourse and street level. Fare gates are located at inbound platform level for this entrance.
Burrard Street elevator access : separated from the main entrance at street level and located to the north, closer to the Burrard and Dunsmuir intersection. A small station house accommodates fare gates at street level. At platform level, the access to the elevator is behind a narrow door and a short corridor.


=== Transit connections ===

Burrard station provides an on-street transit exchange on Burrard, Dunsmuir, and Thurlow Streets. Bus bay assignments are as follows:

35,Vogue Theatre,"Vogue Theatre is an Art Deco/Art Moderne styled building originally built as a movie house and is presently used as an event venue for the performing arts. Situated on Vancouver’s “Theatre Row"", the building was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1990.


== History ==
The Vogue Theatre was designed by architects Kaplan & Sprachman. Construction began in 1940 and was completed in 1941. The Vogue has hosted such events such as Vancouver’s ComedyFest, Vancouver International Film Festival and Vancouver International Jazz Festival. 
It was operated by Canadian Odeon Theatres until 1984, then by Cineplex Odeon, until its closure in 1987. 
In 2010, the property`s owner, Gibbons Hospitality Group, announced intentions of restoring many of the original features of the Vogue and using it as an event space.


== Architecture ==
The Vogue Theatre is an example of Art Deco or Moderne architecture. The Vogue has been a National Historic Site of Canada since it was officially recognized by the federal government on November 20, 1993, under Historic Sites and Monuments Act.

=== Exterior Design ===
The Vogue Theatre is crafted in the Art Deco style, emphasizing sleek lines and fluid contours. It has symmetrical façades, constructed in a mixture of textured concrete and terrazzo panels with wrought-iron screens. One of the defining features of Vogue is its large neon sign which is topped by silhouette of the Roman Goddess Diana.


=== Interior Design ===
The Vogue Theatre has 1,161 seats, with 614 on the orchestra level, 211 in the Dress Circle, and 336 on the Upper Circle. It has curved balconies and curved ceilings in the Art Deco style.
The Vogue has an elaborate modulated lighting system. The stage, made of black-painted maple, is equipped with a flying system 30 feet above the floor. The air-conditioning systems and ducts are concealed in the ceiling coves, which improves the acoustics of the theatre.

36,1994 Vancouver Stanley Cup riot,"The 1994 Vancouver Stanley Cup Riot occurred in Downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on the evening of June 14, 1994, and continued into the following morning. The riot followed Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals in which the Vancouver Canucks lost to the New York Rangers. It was Vancouver's first riot since 1972, when the Rolling Stones American Tour 1972 led to confrontations between the police and 2,000 outside the Pacific Coliseum.


== The riot ==
After the NHL game ended, an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 individuals converged upon Downtown Vancouver. The gathering developed into a riot at Robson and Thurlow Street, after an accident involving a man who fell from a lamp standard into the crowd below.  The police, who were on bicycles, attempted to escort paramedics into the crowd.  When members of the crowd attempted to take a bicycle from one constable, police retreated and warned the crowd to disperse.  Shortly after the riot squad congregated on Thurlow St. on the West side, police fired tear gas into the crowd, causing people to run in all directions.  Many major retailers along Robson had their windows broken, including an Eaton's department store which had more than 50 smashed. The storefronts were eventually guarded by a constable as police regained control of the streets.Tear gas wafted through the open windows of West End residents that night. St. Paul's Hospital responded to the situation by placing guards at the emergency room entrance to prevent tear gas victims from entering, claiming there was nothing that could be done for them.  Eventually, as reported in The New York Times, bowls with water were placed outside by the security guards for those suffering from tear gas. Total damage to the downtown core was estimated at $1.1 million Canadian Dollars.Subduing the crowd required the direct involvement of over 540 officers, of the Vancouver Police Department and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Numerous individuals were arrested and charged, and up to 200 people were injured.


== Aftermath ==
Ryan Berntt, a rioter who was shot in the head with a plastic bullet by police, causing a four-week coma and permanent brain damage, filed a civil suit against police and the City of Vancouver claiming excessive force. In 1997, he was found 75 percent liable for his own injuries, however, the British Columbia Court of Appeal ordered a new trial in 1999. In 2001, Berntt's civil suit was dismissed by the Supreme Court of British Columbia.In New York City, although the celebrations marking the Rangers' first championship in 54 years were peaceful and there were no reports of violence or arrests, they were marred by the Vancouver riots. Rudy Giuliani, who became the city's mayor just five months before, NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, and Rangers President and General Manager Neil Smith said that the Rangers and people in New York City were in shock over the news of the riots and that the shockwaves of it had traveled to the city and put it on the highest alert. Bratton canceled days off for the New York City Police Department on June 17, 1994, the day of the parade for the Rangers, as a precaution against what happened in Vancouver happening in New York City.During their broadcast of the post-game celebrations following Game 7, Hockey Night in Canada's Ron MacLean said when the network broadcast scenes outside Madison Square Garden that the NYPD avoided a large-scale riot by ""continuing to bolster their situation in anticipation of a wild night in Manhattan.""Seventeen years later, the Canucks played the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup Finals. They again lost in Game 7, on June 15, 2011, resulting in a similar riot.

Ryan Berntt, a rioter who was shot in the head with a plastic bullet by police, causing a four-week coma and permanent brain damage, filed a civil suit against police and the City of Vancouver claiming excessive force. In 1997, he was found 75 percent liable for his own injuries, however, the British Columbia Court of Appeal ordered a new trial in 1999. In 2001, Berntt's civil suit was dismissed by the Supreme Court of British Columbia.In New York City, although the celebrations marking the Rangers' first championship in 54 years were peaceful and there were no reports of violence or arrests, they were marred by the Vancouver riots. Rudy Giuliani, who became the city's mayor just five months before, NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, and Rangers President and General Manager Neil Smith said that the Rangers and people in New York City were in shock over the news of the riots and that the shockwaves of it had traveled to the city and put it on the highest alert. Bratton canceled days off for the New York City Police Department on June 17, 1994, the day of the parade for the Rangers, as a precaution against what happened in Vancouver happening in New York City.During their broadcast of the post-game celebrations following Game 7, Hockey Night in Canada's Ron MacLean said when the network broadcast scenes outside Madison Square Garden that the NYPD avoided a large-scale riot by ""continuing to bolster their situation in anticipation of a wild night in Manhattan.""Seventeen years later, the Canucks played the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup Finals. They again lost in Game 7, on June 15, 2011, resulting in a similar riot.

38,Electra Building,"The Electra Building is a major structure in Vancouver, British Columbia.


== History ==
The structure was built by John Laing & Sons in 1957 as the new headquarters for the BC Electric Company, under its president Dal Grauer. A few days after Grauer's death in 1961, it became part of a new provincial crown corporation named BC Hydro. The 21 story, 89 m (293 ft), building was designed by Charles Edward ""Ned"" Pratt. At the time it was claimed to be the tallest building in the Commonwealth, although this was not true. After BC Hydro moved to new offices in Vancouver and Burnaby in the late 1990s, the building was sold, and in 1998, was renovated and converted primarily into residential condo space, although BC Hydro continues to operate the Dal Grauer Substation, whose space is integral with Electra.

While BC Electric's offices were in the building ten large air horns on top of the structure played the first four notes of O Canada at noon every day.  The horns have since been moved to the Pan Pacific Vancouver roof. They are owned and managed by Canada Place.

39,Dunsmuir Tunnel,"The Dunsmuir Tunnel is a subway tunnel below Dunsmuir Street in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The tunnel is used by the Expo Line of Metro Vancouver's  SkyTrain rapid transit system. It is located downtown and has Burrard and Granville stations built within the tunnel. The western tunnel portal is located midway between Waterfront and Burrard stations, while the eastern portal is adjacent to Stadium–Chinatown station.


== History ==

The tunnel was originally built by the Northern Construction Company in 1932 connecting the Canadian Pacific Railway railyards on Burrard Inlet and False Creek at a cost of $1.6 million.  The tunnel's original east portal was located further south than the current portal, easing trains into the False Creek yards on a gentle southward curve. It was clearly visible until about 2005, where it was almost completely hidden next to an outdoor storage area behind the Costco. The original portal was destroyed in 2011 to make way for a new development, but there remains an abandoned section of tunnel, unused by SkyTrain.The tunnel was taken over by BC Transit in the early 1980s when the SkyTrain system was built in conjunction with Expo 86. Because the tunnel is only wide enough to accommodate a single railway track but with sufficiently high clearance, a superstructure was built inside the tunnel to carry the westbound SkyTrain track above the eastbound track.  This results in the two stations within the tunnel having a split platform configuration.

41,Living Shangri-La,"Living Shangri-la is a mixed-use skyscraper in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and is the tallest building in the city and province. The 62-storey Shangri-La tower contains a 5-star hotel and its offices on the first 15 floors, with condominium apartment units occupying the rest of the tower. The building's podium complex also includes a spa, Urban Fare specialty grocery store, a Vancouver Art Gallery public display, and a curated public sculpture garden. The high-rise stands 200.86 metres (659 ft) tall and there is a private roof garden on floor 61. It is the 7th tallest building in Canada.
As part of the development deal, the Coastal Church, built in 1919 and located at the west end of the site, underwent a $4.4 million restoration.


== Hotel ==
The Shangri-La Hotel Vancouver is a full-service hotel that is part of the building. It is a member of the Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts chain, and is Shangri-La's first North American property. The hotel occupies floors Ground to 15 with 119 rooms (including a presidential suite on the 15th floor). There is no 4th or 13th floor. The hotel includes 5-star services such as restaurants, shops, and Chi The Spa at Shangri-La.


== Residences ==
Living Shangri-La also contains 307 residential units, consisting of 234 general live-work homes on floors 16 to 43 and 63 private access residential units on floors 44–60 with three penthouses on floor 61. The condominium units are accessible from the entrance at 1128 West Georgia Street and 1111 Alberni Street.


== Construction ==
The project required 3.1 million man-hours of employment, 15,000 truckloads of earth excavated, 51,000 cubic metres (1,800,000 cu ft) of concrete, and 7,000 metric tons (6,900 long tons; 7,700 short tons) of reinforcing steel. During the height of construction activity, 1,000 workers were on site constructing one floor per week. The Shangri-La set Vancouver's record for the deepest excavation of 26 m (85 ft), defeating the past record of 23 m (75 ft) set by the One Wall Centre, and it officially became the tallest building in Vancouver on October 2, 2007. The total cost of this building was near CA$350 million. The tower crane on top of the building was fitted with Christmas lights on November 13, 2007, and was the tallest crane illuminated in Vancouver in 2007.A windstorm on January 15, 2008, caused loose construction materials to blow off the building and into the streets below. Parked vehicles were damaged by falling plywood, but there were no injuries. The neighbouring Terasen Gas building also sustained damage in the storm. Police closed off West Georgia Street for over twelve hours.The development was marketed by Bob Rennie of Rennie Marketing Systems.

42,Trump International Hotel and Tower (Vancouver),"The Trump International Hotel and Tower Vancouver is a skyscraper and former hotel in Downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The 63-storey, 187.8-metre (616 ft) tower that the hotel was located in is at 1151 West Georgia Street, and was completed in 2016. The tower is the second tallest building in the city, after the Shangri-La tower located across West Georgia Street.
The tower, designed by architect Arthur Erickson, is triangular in shape, twisting gradually with height up to 45 degrees from bottom to top. The building is described as having a 'hyperbolic paraboloid' form; the design is similar to the Absolute Tower in Mississauga, Ontario and Turning Torso in Malmö, Sweden. The developer, Holborn Group, is aiming for LEED Silver certification for the building. Holborn is backed financially by Tony Tiah Thee Kian, chairman of TA Enterprise. The nine-level derelict building formerly occupying the site was demolished.
On August 28, 2020 it was announced that the Hotel would remain permanently closed. Over 250 employees temporarily laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The hotel was informed without warning that they had lost their jobs permanently.


== History ==
The initial project was cancelled on February 25, 2009. Buyers who purchased luxury condos in the tower received letters informing them of the project's cancellation. On June 1, 2009, Holborn Group president Joo Kim Tiah said his company still wanted to see the plan completed on the prime downtown site—if the City of Vancouver wanted to work with him.On August 21, 2009, it was announced that the project would definitely resume, possibly as an even taller building (pending approval from the city) while keeping the same design by Arthur Erickson who died in May of the same year. Work on the project would resume as soon as early 2010, after the Winter Olympics (construction work was not permitted during the Olympics). However, it was not certain as of August 21, 2009, if the Ritz-Carlton ""brand"" would still remain associated with the project. Developers announced August 27, 2009, that the project will proceed. They are re-proposing the project, requesting a height increase from 182.9 metres (600 ft) to 187.8 metres (616 ft).  The proposal called for a higher number of smaller housing units with a more efficient use of floor space while keeping the exterior of the tower aesthetically unchanged (outside of the height increase).  The new proposal went through a series of public hearings before Vancouver city council was scheduled to vote on it in November 2009.
The project was finally revitalized in mid-2011 without Ritz-Carlton as the hotelier. The tower was posthumously redesigned from 58 to 67 storeys and an additional 2 floors of underground parking. In mid-2012, the new hotel tenant was announced to be Marriott. Excavation recommenced in the spring of 2012, with actual construction work beginning in August. By November 2012, the foundation had been completed and substantial construction had commenced, with half of the first floor of parking being completed.
In 2013 at a local press conference, Holborn Group president Joo Kim Tiah, developer of the site, along with the Trump Organization president Donald Trump, accompanied by his three children Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric, unveiled the $360 million Trump International Hotel & Tower Vancouver.
The 63-story condo and hotel complex opened on February 28, 2017, with Donald Jr. and Eric Trump joined by developer Joo Kim Tiah. The opening was met with public protests and a boycott of the ceremony by Mayor Robertson and other local politicians. The building consists of the Trump Hotel on the first 15 floors, topped by 217 condos on the remaining floors.On March 1, 2018, CNN reported that the FBI has opened a counterintelligence investigation into Ivanka Trump; scrutinizing her international business deals at the tower.On August 28, 2020, the hotel reportedly closed permanently and is filing for bankruptcy. The property's website is no longer accepting reservations.

On December 15, 2015, Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson wrote a letter to the developers of the Trump Tower Vancouver to remove Donald Trump's name from the building. Robertson stated that ""Trump’s name and brand have no more place on Vancouver’s skyline than his ignorant ideas have in the modern world."" A petition to remove the name was also mentioned in the letter, with more than 5000 residents voicing their concerns. British Columbia Premier Christy Clark agreed with the movement, stating that ""Donald Trump doesn’t represent our city."" Similar movements occurred in Toronto, default by Talon led to the Trump International Hotel and Tower, Toronto being purchased for renovation and renaming in 2017.

== Accident ==
On January 7, 1981, four carpenters – Donald Davis, Gunther Couvreux, Brian Stevenson and Yrjo Mitrunen – were killed while constructing Bentall Four. They were preparing a platform known as a 'fly form' (see formwork) for the last concrete pour on the roof, when it broke free. Without warning the fly form; known as 'fly form E', fell over the edge and carried the four men to their deaths. The news of this horrific accident shocked people across Canada and around the world.
On February 23, 1981, the Coroner's Inquest was held in Vancouver. It would be referred to as a marathon inquest, since it went into the eighth day with 30 witnesses being called upon to testify. Anthes Equipment Ltd was the company that designed and supplied the fly forms to the contractor building the tower. Anthes Equipment Ltd of Toronto was not registered to be working in BC at the time of the accident; leaving them liable to civil action. The equipment they supplied was also non-compliant with the specifications required in BC at the time.One of the widows; Carol Davis, individually filed a writ on February 19, 1982, in the Supreme Court in an unprecedented action against Anthes Equipment Ltd. The other families elected to allow the Workers Compensation Board to sue on their behalf. On February 23, 1984; the fourth day into the trial, Carol Davis accepted an out-of-court settlement from Anthes Equipment Ltd.

44,Holy Rosary Cathedral (Vancouver),"The Metropolitan Cathedral of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary, commonly known as Holy Rosary Cathedral, is a late 19th-century French Gothic revival church that serves as the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vancouver.  It is located in the downtown area of the city at the intersection of Richards and Dunsmuir streets.The construction of the cathedral began in 1899 on the site of an earlier church by the same name.  It opened on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 8, 1900, was blessed the day after, and was consecrated in 1953.  The style has been described as resembling the medieval Chartres Cathedral in France.  The church was elevated to the status of cathedral in 1916.  It is listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register and is a legally protected building.


== History ==


=== Original structure (1887–1899) ===
The parish was established in June 1885 and Father Patrick Fay, the chaplain to Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) workers, was chosen as pastor.  He officiated the first mass of the parish on the feast of Our Lady of the Rosary in the same year at an unknown location.  Although masses were held in Blair's Hall and Keefer's Hall, it became apparent that a new and permanent church was necessary to cope with the growing number of parishioners, which consisted of 69 families.

In order to pick a site for the new church, legend has it that Father Fay went to the Coal Harbour waterfront, looked south towards the forested land (present-day Downtown Vancouver) and chose the area that contained the tallest tree.  Construction began in 1886 and the wooden church was completed and blessed in the following year.  Two years later, the church was enlarged and a bell tower was added.


=== Present-day cathedral ===
With the rapid growth of Vancouver at the time, plans were made for a greater expansion of the church.  Because Fay was transferred in 1892 and died shortly after, Father Eumellin succeeded him in overseeing the plan for construction from 1893 to 1897.  Then, the new pastor of the church, Father James McGuckin, took over the project.  By that time, the number of parishioners had outgrown the size of the church building.  In order to fund the construction of the new church, the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate (OMI) – the religious order McGuckin belonged to – mortgaged their headquarters in France, and before his death, Fay worked as a CPR foreman for a construction crew.  Initially, parishioners and the OMI were skeptical of the project; the parish was already heavily in debt when McGuckin became pastor, the Catholic community in Vancouver – though ""rapidly growing"" – was still ""relatively small"" in number, and a friend of McGuckin who was a contractor was unable to provide the funds he had initially pledged.  These problems culminated in the construction project being labelled ""McGuckin's Folly"".

Despite these doubts, the cornerstone of the new church was laid on July 16, 1899, by Archbishop Adélard Langevin of Saint Boniface.  Thomas Ennor Julian and H.J. Williams were hired to be the architects, and in just 491 days, the construction was completed.  At the time it was finished, the building was praised as ""the finest piece of architecture west of Toronto and north of San Francisco.""  The new Church of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary opened on December 8, 1900 – the Feast of the Immaculate Conception – and was blessed one day later by Archbishop Alexander Christie of Portland, Oregon.  By the end of the decade, it became ""the most financially important parish"" in the archdiocese, since it was the only church that not only could break-even, but could also churn out a surplus.  Because of this, Archbishop Timothy Casey wanted to make the church the cathedral for the metropolitan see.  The OMI were extremely reluctant to give up their church, and even attempted to give Casey money so that he could buy land elsewhere to build a new cathedral.  Nonetheless, the church was elevated to the status of cathedral in 1916, but the Oblates were permitted to remain.  The OMI – which administered the parish since 1893 – eventually left in 1927 after difficulties arose from the mortgage agreement that had helped pay for the construction of the cathedral.  This was coupled with the ""growing manpower shortage"" caused by a declining number of members joining the order.Since a Catholic church can only be consecrated once it has become free from debt, the cathedral did not have its rite of consecration held until October 3, 1953, fifty-three years after it first opened.  The ceremony – which commenced just after daybreak – was officiated by the Archbishop of Vancouver William M. Duke, with the subsequent solemn pontifical Mass celebrated by Michael Harrington, the Bishop of Kamloops.  Approximately thirty-five bishops from across Canada and the United States attended the event, which coincided with Duke's golden and silver jubilees of his priestly ordination and consecration as a bishop, respectively.On October 7, 1952, the feast day of the cathedral's namesake, a gunman entered the church and fired a round from his rifle at the altar.  No one was hurt and he was arrested shortly after.  A minor tilt in the bell tower of the cathedral was detected in April 1959, probably due to the drilling and blasting of a nearby tunnel.

Many significant events have taken place at the cathedral.  In 1936, it hosted an archdiocesan-level Eucharistic Congress, the first congress ever to be celebrated in Western Canada.  Forty-eight years later, in 1984, Pope John Paul II visited the church as part of his pastoral visit to Canada.  In late September 2001, the cathedral became the first place in Canada to host the relics of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux during her reliquary's three-month-long tour of the country.Over the years, several notable people had their funeral requiem mass said at the cathedral, including beloved local lifeguard and swim instructor Joe Fortes (1922), Chief Dan George of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation (1981), and former Vancouver police commissioner William Cameron Murphy in 1961.  The funeral of Fortes in February 1922 saw the cathedral filled to capacity, with thousands of others braving the rain and cold weather to view the funeral procession on the streets of Vancouver.  Requiem masses were also held at the cathedral for popes Pius XI (1939) and John Paul II (2005), while an interfaith requiem was also held for former Governor General of Canada Georges Vanier in 1967.


== Architecture ==

The cathedral, built in a French Gothic style, is cruciform in the shape of the Latin cross.  The exterior walls of the church were built from sandstone originating from Gabriola Island, while its foundations were made of granite. The two bell towers – which are asymmetric – have been labelled as the cathedral's ""most prominent visual feature"".  The taller steeple was originally designed to have flying buttresses at the bottom.  The interior features columns that support the nave which are made from red Scagliola marble. The cathedra is situated at the centre of the sanctuary, surrounded by an oak altar-piece and two towers of reredos.  In total, the dimensions of the church building are 161 ft (49 m) long, 104 ft (32 m) wide and 62 ft (19 m) tall, with the taller steeple rising to 217 ft (66 m).Over the years, the cathedral has undergone a series of renovations.  In late 1932, the ""tin scales"" that covered spire of the taller steeple were cleaned and repaired, and the cross atop of it was repainted.  The reordering of the sanctuary took place in the 1960s after the Second Vatican Council.  Refurbishing also took place prior to Pope John Paul II's visit to the cathedral in 1984.  The cathedral was completely re-roofed from 1995 to 1997, with zinc being utilized on the roof to resemble slate.  In December 2002, some of the carpeting was removed and replaced with Italian ceramic tiles, and the inside of the church was repainted from 2004 to 2006.


=== Bells ===
When the cathedral was first built, seven bells – representing the sacraments – were cast at the Fonderie Paccard in Annecy-le-Vieux, Savoy, France and were blessed on October 21, 1900.  However, they were soon found to be out of tune and were sent back to Europe, this time to a foundry near Bristol.  This time, eight bells were made in order to complete an entire octave when rung.  They were reinstalled in the cathedral in 1906 and operate on change ringing.  They are one of the few peal of bells hung in the English style found in North America, and one of three in British Columbia – the others are located at Westminster Abbey in Mission and Victoria's Christ Church Cathedral.  The bells were notably rung on Dominion Day in 1911 – the first peal ever to be rung in Canada – and on February 12, 2010, in honour of the opening of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.


=== Organ ===

The cathedral's pipe organ was originally built and inaugurated in the autumn of 1900.  Manufactured by the Karn–Warren Organ Company in Woodstock, Ontario, the organ is the ""oldest romantic-style organ"" in the province ""remaining in its original location"".  Over the years, the instrument's condition deteriorated due to ""general wear and tear"", shoddy repairs and water damage caused by the leaking roof.  As a result, the organ was dismantled in 1999 and transported to Casavant Frères in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec.  It was restored within two years and returned to the church, where it was blessed in Easter of 2000.  In that same year, an organ concert series was hosted at the cathedral for the first time, and has been held annually since.


=== Stained glass windows ===
There are currently 21 stained glass windows at the cathedral.  The most renowned ones are the five windows made by Canadian artist Guido Nincheri.  They depict Our Lady of the Holy Rosary, the Baptism of Our Lord, Jesus Healing the Sick, Jesus with the Children and the Assumption.  The window showing Our Lady of the Holy Rosary featured on Canada Post's annual Christmas stamp in 1997.  Furthermore, the Institute for Stained Glass in Canada documented the stained glass windows at the cathedral.


=== Sculpture of Homeless Jesus ===

A copy of the bronze sculpture Homeless Jesus by Canadian artist Timothy Schmalz was installed in front of the cathedral in the spring of 2017.  It shows a life-size man with a long overcoat lying on a park bench.  His face is hidden underneath a hood, and his bare feet have stigmata.  According to Stanley Galvon, the rector at the time, the statue is intended to be ""a catalyst to make people think about"" the city's homelessness crisis.


== Modern day ==
The cathedral made news in 2007, with the Vancouver Police Department having to be called in on a weekly basis; cathedral staff claimed they were ""under siege"" by panhandlers who frequented the building and who were involved in at least one incident daily.  These revelations came to light when a homeless man mugged an 81-year-old parishioner in the cathedral on August 1 of that year and was caught on camera.On March 23, 2008, First Nations protesters disrupted an Easter Sunday Mass at the cathedral by demonstrating on the outside steps.  They ordered the Church to ""get off native land"" and demanded that they disclose the burial locations of children who died in residential schools.  A similar protest occurred on October 30, 2011, when a splinter group from the Occupy Vancouver movement marched to the cathedral from the Vancouver Art Gallery.  They attempted to enter the cathedral and occupy it but were thwarted by Vancouver police officers and Knights of Columbus.Sunday Mass was celebrated without a congregation for the first time in the cathedral's history on March 22, 2020.  This came as a result of the Archdiocese suspending all public masses starting from March 21 onwards, in response to the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.  Public masses at the cathedral resumed three months later in June, with capacity reduced to 50 people per Mass in order to adhere to the physical distancing requirements set out by the provincial health authorities.

45,St. Andrew's Wesley Church,"St. Andrew's Wesley Church is a church located in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The church was designed by Twizel and Twizel and is constructed from Nelson Island (British Columbia) granite and Haddington Island (British Columbia) stone.St. Andrew’s-Wesley Church was completed in 1927 for the union of Presbyterian, Methodist, Congregational and Local Union Churches. The name combines the congregations of St. Andrew’s Presbyterian and Wesley Methodist.

Earlier historyMethodist missionaries arrived in Vancouver from Britain around 1859. A church was eventually built on Water St. in 1875 but was destroyed in the Great Vancouver Fire of 1886. In 1887, the congregation divided into two: Princess Street and Homer Street.
In 1870 a Presbyterian congregation was organized in a local community schoolhouse. First Presbyterian Church was erected on Cordova Street but was also destroyed in the 1886 fire. The congregation then moved to a larger centre on the corner of Gore and Hastings Streets in 1892. Both church congregations built, inhabited and sold several ever-larger church buildings.
In 1927 St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church on Georgia and Richards, and Wesley Methodist, amalgamated as St. Andrew’s-Wesley United Church. The sale of that smaller property allowed the growing combined congregations to purchase the current site on Burrard and Nelson streets. The “Cathedral Church of the United Church in B.C.” - St. Andrew’s-Wesley’s new building was opened on May 26, 1933, with Rev. Dr. Willard Brewing as first minister of the united congregation.

=== One Book, One Vancouver ===
One Book, One Vancouver was a citywide book club sponsored by the Vancouver Public Library. Titles were selected by the library staff, who voted on one of four titles presented by the One Book, One Vancouver Organizing Committee. It was discontinued after 2010.


== History ==
In January 1869, the manager of the Hastings Mill, J.A. Raymur, started the New London Mechanics Institute, a meeting room and library for mill employees. In March 1869, it was renamed the Hastings Literary Institute, in honour of Rear Admiral the Honourable George Fowler Hastings. No official records of the Hastings Literary Institute have survived, but it is known that membership was by subscription.  The Hastings Literary Institute continued to exist until the Granville area was incorporated as part of the new City of Vancouver on April 6, 1886.
Following the Great Vancouver Fire on June 13, 1886, 400 books from the now-defunct Hastings Literary Institute were donated to the newly established Vancouver Reading Room. In December 1887, the Reading Room opened at 144 West Cordova Street, above the Thomas Dunn and Company hardware store. It was also known as the Vancouver Free Library and the Vancouver Free Reading Room and Library.
By the late 1890s, the Free Reading Room and Library in the YMCA Building on West Hastings had become overcrowded. During this period, the American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie was giving money to cities and towns to build libraries. In 1901, the City of Vancouver approached Carnegie about donating money for a new library to replace the space in the YMCA Building.

In 1901, American steel magnate, Andrew Carnegie agreed to donate $50,000 to build a city library if Vancouver would provide free land and $5,000 annually to support its operation. A fight immediately developed between East and West side Vancouver as to who would get the new cultural institution. A public plebiscite fixed the site at Hastings and Westminster (now Main) Streets, next door to the first City Hall. The cornerstone was laid by the Grand Lodge of the Masonic Order on March 29, 1902 and under it were placed Masonic documents, a copy of the City’s Act of Incorporation, lists of various officials and examples of the postage stamps and coins then in use. The building was designed by Vancouver architect George Grant and is in the style of Romanesque Renaissance, with a domed Ionic portico and French mansard roof. Granite for the foundation came from Indian Arm and sandstone for the 10"" thick walls came from Gabriola Island. A fantastic marble, spiral staircase was built by Albion Iron Works of Victoria. It cost $2.279 million and 9,888 pounds of steel and iron were used. A large multi-panel stained glass window with 3 smaller windows below was designed and crafted by N.T. Lyon of Toronto. Depicted in the windows are John Milton, William Shakespeare, Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott, Sir Thomas More, and Edmund Spenser. The 3 small windows were removed in 1958 when the library was converted into the museum. They were missing for many years but were located intact and returned to the building in 1985. Inside was hardwood panelled walls and ceilings and oak floors. The rooms were heated by eight fireplaces. There were special reading rooms for ladies and for children, a chess room, newspaper reading room, picture gallery, lecture hall, and on the third floor the Art, Historical and Scientific Association (now called the Vancouver Museum). The library opened in November 1903. This branch is now primarily used as a community centre for residents of the Downtown East Side neighbourhood.

The Vancouver Public Library continued to occupy the Hastings and Main site until the opening of a new central library at 750 Burrard Street in 1957. The move from the Carnegie site to the new location at 750 Burrard began in mid-October 1957, and the official opening of the new library was held on November 1, 1957. The library remained at the Burrard building until April 22, 1995, when it closed in preparation for the move to a new location at Library Square (350 West Georgia Street). The central branch opened in Downtown Vancouver on May 26, 1995 and cost CAD $106.8 million to build.
In September, 2009, the library cancelled a room booking made by the group Exit International to hold a workshop by Dr. Philip Nitschke about assisted suicide. The cancellation came despite months of negotiation between Exit and library administration. The library stated that it had received a legal opinion stating the workshop as described could contravene Canada's Criminal Code, but would not make the opinion public. The workshop was held at Vancouver's Unitarian Church. ""Whatever the reasons of the library were, it's obviously not affecting the decision by the Unitarian Church,"" Dr. Nitschke said. David Eby, executive director of the BC Civil Liberties Association, which failed to get the ban lifted, said ""Usually, librarians are our closest allies in this free-speech debate.""

== Branches ==
In 1927 the first permanent branch was opened in Kitsilano (2375 West Fourth Avenue). Sixteen years later, in 1943, the second branch, Kerrisdale (Forty-second Avenue and West Boulevard), came into service. Other branches followed throughout the years, with the last branch, the Terry Salman Branch, opening in 2011. The Strathcona Branch, which shared its collection and facilities with Lord Strathcona Elementary School, was removed from the system in 2016, pending the opening of the nə́c̓aʔmat ct Strathcona Branch in same community in 2017.

The Vancouver Public Library system now consists of 22 branches situated throughout the city.  Since 2013, all branches are open at least Tuesday through Sunday. The administration centre, and also the largest branch, known as the Central Branch, is located at Library Square in downtown Vancouver.
The oldest existing branch, the Kitsilano branch, is the regional reference library for the North Area division of the Libraries. The largest non-Central branch in terms of volumes held, is the Renfrew Branch, with 325,000 volumes.  The Renfrew Branch is listed as having the largest square footage, at 16,000 square feet, while the Kensington branch at 7,100 square feet is one of the larger branch libraries.The approximate number of volumes in each VPL branch are:


=== Central branch ===

Consolidating Vancouver Public Library's Central Branch, Federal Office Tower, and retail and service facilities, the Library Square occupies a city block in Downtown Vancouver. Centred on the block, the library is a nine-story rectangular box containing book stacks and services, surrounded by a free-standing, elliptical, colonnaded wall featuring reading and study areas that are accessed by bridges spanning skylit light wells. The building is located in the eastern portion of the Vancouver Central Business District. The address of the library is 350 West Georgia Street, and the Federal office tower is addressed at 300 West Georgia Street. Levels 8 and 9 were previously leased to the Provincial government. Their address was 360 West Georgia Street.
VPL Central branch internal glass facade overlooks an enclosed concourse formed by a second elliptical wall that defines the east side of the site. This glass-roofed concourse serves as an entry foyer to the library and the more lively pedestrian activities at ground level. Public spaces surrounding the library form a continuous piazza with parking located below grade. The building's exterior resembles the current appearance of the Colosseum in Rome.

Adjacent to the Central Branch is Library Square, a public square is bordered by Robson Street, Homer Street, West Georgia Street, and Hamilton Street. Across West Georgia Street is Canada Post. Across Hamilton Street is the CBC Regional Broadcast Centre Vancouver. Across Homer street is The Centre in Vancouver for the Performing Arts, (formerly The Ford Centre for the Performing Arts) also designed by Moshe Safdie as a complementary building to library square. The Library Square Project was the largest capital project ever undertaken by the City of Vancouver. The decision to build the project came after a favourable public referendum in November 1990. The City then held a design competition to choose a design for the new building. The design by Moshe Safdie  and DA Architects was by far the most radical design and yet was the public favourite. 70% of the public liked the Safdie scheme as a ""unique, imaginative, exciting, interesting building."" The inclusion of the 21 story office tower in the design was required in order to pay for it and as part of a deal with the federal government to obtain the land; the federal government has a long term lease on the high rise office tower portion of the project. Construction began in early 1993 and was completed in 1995. In the year following the new library's opening, library visitors increased by 800,000.In addition to its function as the central branch of the city's public library system, the one square block project includes an attached office high-rise, retail shops, restaurants, and underground public parking. The Library building has a rooftop garden designed by Vancouver landscape architect Cornelia Oberlander. The roof garden is accessible by the public. The new 8,000-sq-ft rooftop garden and the expansion to Level 9 were built at a cost of $15.5 million; they opened to the public in September, 2018. The expansion is LEED Gold CIv1 certified, managed by Light House Sustainable Building Centre

52,One Wall Centre,"One Wall Centre, also known as the Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre North Tower, is a 48-storey, 157.8 m (518 ft) skyscraper hotel with residential condominiums in the Wall Centre development at 1088 Burrard Street in Downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The tower was designed by Perkins+Will Canada, and completed in 2001, and went on to win the Emporis Skyscraper Award for the Best New Skyscraper the same year. As of March 2018 it is the fourth-tallest building in the city.


== Background ==
The first 27 floors of the building are the 4 Diamond Sheraton Hotel. Floors 28, 29, and 30 are the Club Intrawest Resort floors; which are operated independent of Sheraton. Floors 31 to 48 are residential condominiums. The One Wall Centre tower is part of the Wall Centre complex owned by Wall Financial Corporation and was largely the vision of Peter Wall.


== Construction ==
To counteract possible harmonic swaying during high winds, One Wall has a tuned water damping system at the top level of the building which consists of two specially designed 50,000-imperial-gallon (60,000 U.S. gal; 227,300 L) water tanks. These tanks are designed so that the harmonic frequency of the sloshing of the water in the tanks counteracts the harmonic frequency of the swaying of the building.
The Sheraton Wall Centre required a 23 m (75 ft) deep excavation — the deepest excavation prior to Living Shangri-La for a building in the city.According to the June 2004 edition of Elevator World, Richmond Elevator Maintenance Ltd. won a contract for the lowest bid to supply the building's elevators, one of the local elevator firm's first examples of traction elevators. The installation features 10 elevators, 8 of which are high speed geared machines. The hotel is served by four 1,400 kg (3,100 lb) traction elevators at 244 m/min (800 ft/min), with a group of 3 for public usage and a single private VIP access elevator. There are also two hotel service elevators with 1,800 kg (4,000 lb) capacity each at 213 m/min (700 ft/min). The apartments are served by 2 elevators, each with a capacity of 1,600 kg (3,500 lb) at 305 m/min (1,000 ft/min). There are also 2 roped hydraulic elevators: the 1,400 kg (3,100 lb) to serve the parking garage, and the 2,300 kg (5,100 lb) to serve the banquet floors. There are 6 escalators installed by Fujitec.


== Cultural references ==
This building was featured in the movie X-Men: The Last Stand as one of the buildings they used to give the cure to the mutants.
The opening sequence of The Core, where a man collapses at a business meeting and the camera pans out to the street to show a number of simultaneous accidents, was filmed here.
The plaza directly in front of this building was used in exterior shots for the 1996 Fox TV series Profit to represent the immediate area outside the corporate offices of fictional Gracen & Gracen Inc (G&G). While the One Wall Centre building did not exist in 1996 when the series was filmed, the two towers immediately adjacent to this building were featured prominently in the series as the corporate headquarters for G&G.
The courtyard of the Wall Centre appears in Caprica's season 1 episode, ""Retribution"".

55,St. Paul's Hospital (Vancouver),"St. Paul's Hospital is an acute care hospital located in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is the oldest of the seven health care facilities operated by Providence Health Care, a Roman Catholic faith-based care provider.
St. Paul's is open to patients regardless of their faith and is home to many medical and surgical programs, including cardiac services and kidney care including an advanced structural heart disease program. It is also the home of the Pacific Adult Congenital Heart Disease unit. It is one of the teaching hospitals of the University of British Columbia Faculty of Medicine. Approximately 4000 people work at St Paul's Hospital.
On August 12th, 2020, it was announced that the hospital's land in downtown Vancouver, was sold to Concord Pacific for $1 billion. Providence healthcare, the hospital operator, mentioned that the proceeds from this sale would go to the construction of the new St. Paul's Hospital in the False Creek Flats neighborhood, which is expected to open in 2026.


== History ==
The original St. Paul's Hospital was founded in 1894 just eight years after the incorporation of the City of Vancouver by the Sisters Of Providence who (from their base in Montreal) founded schools, hospitals and asylums all over North America and other continents.
The 25-bed, 4-storey wood frame building cost $28,000. It was designed and constructed by Mother Joseph of the Sacred Heart and named after the then-bishop, Paul Durieu of New Westminster.Mother Mary Fredrick from Astoria, Oregon was the first mother superior and administrator to lead its charge. In keeping with the philosophy of the Sisters of Providence, the new hospital was founded on the pledge of providing compassionate care for everyone in need - tested by a surge in Vancouver's growth brought on by the Klondike gold rush in the 1890s.
St Paul's became one of the first hospitals with their own X-Ray machine in 1906 and opened its School of Nursing in 1907.In 1912, the original building was demolished and replaced with a new structure to accommodate 200 patients at a construction cost of $400,000.Father David Bauer, a Basilian priest at St. Mark's College, served as chaplain for the hospital from 1961 to 1988.In 2010, the hospital established Angel's Cradle, the first modern Baby hatch in Canada where mothers could anonymously provide their newborns to the hospital rather than abandon them elsewhere. Thirty seconds after a baby has been placed inside the modern version of a 'foundling wheel', a sensor alerts emergency staff. A social worker contacts the Ministry of Children and Family Development which then assumes responsibility for the baby. In its first five years, two healthy babies had been placed in the baby hatch.St. Paul's Hospital is listed on the City of Vancouver's Heritage Register category “A” but is not a designated heritage building and is not protected by legal statute.


== Redevelopment ==
In the 21st Century, there has been ongoing advocacy for redevelopment of the facility. A redevelopment plan was drafted in 2010. In 2012, Premier Christy Clark said at the hospital that business case and development plans would be completed in order to begin construction in 2016.In 2015, questions continued to be raised whether the redevelopment would maintain full range of existing services at the Burrard Street facility or move some services to a new location near False Creek. On April 13, 2015, Providence Health Care and the provincial government announced the hospital services would move to the new site and grow in size from more than 400 beds to more than 700 beds and an integrated health campus that includes a range of outpatient and ambulatory services: 

full-service critical care hospital
24/7 primary care services
Chronic disease management services
Mental health and addictions beds and programs
On-site residential care beds and programs
Ambulatory services and outpatient clinics
Non-acute medical services
A low-risk birthing centre
End-of-life care

57,Marine Building,"The Marine Building is a skyscraper located at 355 Burrard Street in Downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada near the Financial District. Completed in 1930, at the time of its opening it was the city's tallest skyscraper and it is one of the most iconic buildings in Vancouver and listed among the best Art Deco buildings in the world. It owes its name to the plethora of fine marine-themed ornaments that decorate it. Because of its iconic architecture and luscious interior decorations, the building has been chosen as the setting of a number of film and television productions.


== History ==
The building was conceived by Lt. Commander J.W. Hobbs, an entrepreneur from Toronto. Hobbs recognized that the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 would greatly increase Vancouver's importance as a commercial port, and decided that the city needed a grand, iconic building, in the venue of the newly constructed Chrysler Building in New York. The design was assigned to McCartner Nairne and Partners, who had never worked on the design of a skyscraper before. Construction started on March 13, 1929 as reported by a local newspaper:

Yesterday morning, His Worship Mayor W.H. Malkin blew a blast on a golden whistle and with it set in motion the steam shovel that will excavate the site for the new Burrard Street Marine skyscraper.
The building was completed on 7 October 1930. At 97.8 metres (321 ft) (22 floors) it was the tallest skyscraper in the city until 1939. According to the architects, McCarter & Nairne, the building was intended to evoke ""some great crag rising from the sea, clinging with sea flora and fauna, tinted in sea-green, touched with gold."" The building cost $2.3 million to build – $1.1 million over budget—but due to the Great Depression it was sold to the Guinness family of Ireland for only $900,000. The 2016 property assessment is $90 million.
There was an observation deck, but during the depression in the 1930s the 25-cent admission price proved unaffordable for most. Currently, there are no public galleries in the building.
Inside the massive brass-doored elevators the walls are inlaid with 12 varieties of local hardwoods. All over the walls and polished brass doors are depictions of sea snails, skate, crabs, turtles, carp, scallops, seaweed and sea horses, as well as the transportation means of the era. The floor presents the zodiac signs. The exterior is studded with flora and fauna, tinted in sea-green and touched with gold.
During a renovation from 1982-1989 to update the electrical, mechanical and air-conditioning systems, the ""battleship linoleum"" (imported from Scotland) in the lobby was replaced with marble. The former Merchant Exchange was also gutted, and is now a restaurant called Tractor Foods.  This building was also the management centre for Oneworld, of one of the three largest airline alliances in the world, from its founding in May 2000 until it was relocated to New York City in June 2011.


== In popular culture ==
The building has often been used in filmmaking and television production. It was the setting for the final scene in the movie, Timecop and it was used as the headquarters of the Daily Planet in the popular television show Smallville and as the Freelancers headquarter in the TV show Continuum. The building was used in the movie Blade: Trinity. It stood in for the Baxter Building in New York City in 2005's Fantastic Four and its sequel, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.

66,Harbour Centre,"Harbour Centre is a skyscraper in the central business district of Downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada which opened in 1977. The ""Lookout"" tower atop the office building makes it one of the tallest structures in Vancouver and a prominent landmark on the city's skyline. With its 360-degree viewing deck, it also serves as a tourist attraction with the Top of Vancouver Revolving Restaurant, offering a physically unobstructed view of the city.
Harbour Centre is located at 555 West Hastings Street in Downtown Vancouver. It is steps away from Waterfront Station, a major multi-modal transit hub which serves as the Downtown Vancouver terminal for various TransLink operations including SeaBus, West Coast Express, SkyTrain, Canada Line and buses. Simon Fraser University operates its downtown Harbour Centre campus in the adjoining Spencer building and houses the Center for Dialogue and Canadas World.
Vancouver Coast Guard Radio operates from Harbour Centre, providing distress watch and vessel traffic services to the North Arm Fraser River, Burrard Inlet, Indian Arm, English Bay and Howe Sound.


== History ==
The downtown Simpsons-Sears department store was located here before it closed in 1987.
During the dot-com boom of the 1990s, it served as the headquarters for several tech firms, including Stormix Technologies, NetNation and others.


== Official Height Discrepancies ==
Designed by WZMH Architects, the building is listed as being 28 stories tall, though the tower/observation deck extends above the 28 office floors (claimed to be approximately 44 stories in total). There is some disagreement as to the building's height. According to the Vancouver Lookout's website the observation deck is 168 m (551 ft) above the 'street level'. The CTBUH however lists the buildings architectural height as actually being 147 m (482 ft). Furthermore, Skyscraperpage lists the buildings height to the roof as being only 139.6 m (458 ft). This is stated to be the height from the Hastings Street entrance while the height from the back entrance on Cordova Street is 146 m (479 ft). It also lists the buildings pinnacle height to the tip of the antenna as being 170.1 m (558 ft).The building was British Columbia's tallest measured by pinnacle height until the construction of Living Shangri-La in 2009.


== Tourist attraction ==
The Vancouver Lookout tourist attraction, located atop the Harbour Centre business building, was officially opened on August 13, 1977 by Neil Armstrong, whose footprint was imprinted onto cement and was on display on the viewing/observation deck until it was lost (or stolen) during renovations. Glass elevators whisk visitors 168 meters (553 feet) skyward from street level to the Observation Deck in 40 seconds.


== In television and film ==
In Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction?, a group of young teenage girls ride the famous glass elevator to the top to dine at the fictional ""Above the Clouds"" restaurant and the elevator breaks down. (S04E13 - ""Above the Clouds""). 
Harbour Centre can also be seen in the Arrow episode ""Dark Waters"".  The Harbour Centre is visible in the background along with the rest of the downtown Vancouver skyline at the beginning of The X-Files episode ""2Shy"".
This building was also filmed in some episodes from the original MacGyver TV series in and around Vancouver. This building also had some shots from the TV Series Danger Bay. There were also some shots from the Schwarzenegger film The 6th Day and the film Blade: Trinity.

71,Great Vancouver Fire,"The Great Vancouver Fire was a conflagration that destroyed most of the newly incorporated city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on June 13, 1886.  It started as two land clearing fires to the west of the city. The first fire was further away from the city and was clearing land for the roundhouse of the terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The second fire was clearing land to extend the city to the west. The Great Fire occurred shortly after the township of Granville was incorporated into the City of Vancouver.The fires spread north east into the city, killing at least 21 people  and destroying 600–1,000 buildings (the exact numbers are unknown). Most residents escaped by fleeing to the Burrard Inlet shore or the False Creek shore. Following the recovery efforts, the city of Vancouver continued to grow. The first police force was set up, the first brick buildings were built, and the first fire engine was brought in from the nearby larger town of New Westminster.


== Early Vancouver ==

European settlement in the Vancouver area began in 1862 after Captain George Henry Richard's 1859 discovery of coal in the Burrard Inlet. The settlement of Granville (later Vancouver) was formed in the mid-1860s between two Burrard Inlet sawmills. It began as shops and hotels providing service to the workers of the mills and later their families. The two sawmills were Moodyville (originally Moody's Mill), opened 1863, on the Burrard Inlet north shore and Hastings Mill (originally Stamps Mill), opened 1867, on the Inlet's south shore. The two mills were the main employers in Granville. In the early 1880s, they employed between 150 and 200 workers, not including loggers and longshoremen. The exact numbers are unknown as many of the workers were transient unmarried men, who worked at a mill for only a few weeks at a time before moving on.  To reach Granville required either a nine-mile journey through dense forest from the nearby larger town of New Westminster or a thirty-mile journey via the Fraser River from Fort Langley, the capital of British Columbia at the time.In 1885 it was announced that Granville would be the west coast terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The township of Granville was incorporated as the city of Vancouver on April 6, 1886, becoming the fourth city in British Columbia. At the first city council election on May 3, 1886, Malcolm MacLean was elected the city's Mayor. The inaugural meeting of the Vancouver Volunteer Hose Company No.1 was held May 28th 1886. Future Vancouver blocks and streets had been marked out to the west of the city to allow for its anticipated growth. These had been designated by the Canadian Pacific Railway land commissioner Lachlan Hamilton.


=== Demographics ===

Early Vancouver attracted budding entrepreneurs who were very active in the civic politics forming the new city. The population of Granville grew substantially in the early to mid 1880s. The population and economic growth in the area in early 1886 was so significant three new newspapers were established. The mid-1880s also saw a change in the population from mostly unmarried men and some families with First Nations wives to an increasing number of families especially with European wives.Following the British victory in the Opium Wars, British colonies such as Vancouver received an influx of Chinese migrants from the provinces surrounding Canton, the sole port for foreign trade. Most of these migrants were employed at the Hastings Mill. The Canadian Paciific Railway also brought in Chinese railway workers, employed to establish the CPR terminus.


=== First Nations people ===
The main native population in the area at the time of European settlement was the Salish-speaking Squamish people. They had been in the area from Howe Sound to the north to English Bay and Burrard Inlet to the south for at least 500 years.  The Musqueam people lived further south but had a presence in the Burrard Inlet area dating back at least 2,000 years.  When sawmilling began in 1863, the local Squamish men were hired as  unskilled labour. The mission reserve near Moodyville and the Indian rancheria at Hastings Mill were the product of the mill's employment of native people. In 1881 there were at least 500 Squamish at Burrard Inlet.  The first nations people were not given the same rights as their British and North American contemporaries. The men were not hired for the higher skilled and higher paid roles at the sawmills while the women were unable to inherit property from their white partners and were often kicked out of their home after his death.


== Origin ==
Prior to the fire, Vancouver had experienced three weeks of abnormal heat for late spring. Sunday, June 13, was particularly hot with an offshore breeze from the Pacific Ocean. There was also significant forest deadfall in the area to the East of the city as well as debris from the recent clearing for the expansion of the city which provided fuel to the fire.


=== First clearing fire ===
The first clearing fire was located to the south-west of the city. The land was being cleared to create the roundhouse for the western terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The dry conditions and a Pacific breeze caused the fire to grow out of workers' control throughout the morning and into the afternoon.


=== Second clearing fire ===
The second clearing fire was located at the west end of the city near the intersection of Cambie and Cordova street. The fire was being used to clear land for the expansion of the city. It grew out of control in the early afternoon.


== Spread ==

The men working on the clearing fires and volunteers from the town attempted to put out both fires with buckets, wet blankets and shovels. For the first clearing fire, the water came from False Creek, whilst the second fire used the hand-pump well at the newly constructed nearby Regina Hotel. The men attempted to bring both fires under control into the afternoon, however, the breeze turned to a gale and the men at the first fire were forced to give up their efforts and flee to the False Creek shore. At the second fire, an attempt to create a fire break with pickaxes was unsuccessful. The second fire was abandoned when the two fire fronts joined.The smoke from the fire filled the sky over the town.  The men fleeing warned the people in the town of the incoming fire. Most residents hurriedly packed up their belongings and their stores and headed to the Burrard Inlet shore. However, despite warnings from other residents and the growing smoke, a number of residents did not believe the fire was dangerous. Some residents waited until the last minute to flee whilst others headed to the hotels to drink the unguarded liquor. The Squamish people from the south shore village Snauq, paddled across in canoes to view the fire.At the Burrard Inlet shore, some residents were able to flee out into the inlet on floats and vessels. The local Squamish Nation provided help to the survivors who were floundering in the water. They paddled over and canoed people to safety. The men of the Vancouver Volunteer Hose Company No.1 went to Scoullar's General Store to remove a supply of explosives, which were taken to the Hastings Mill at the opposite end of town. The city clerk Thomas McGuian saved the city records detailing the city's short history by entrusting them to a stranger.


== After the fire ==

After the fire passed, the newly elected Mayor of Vancouver, Malcolm MacLean, sent telegrams to the Canadian Prime Minister and the Mayor of Toronto. The telegram to the Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald read: ""Our city is ashes three thousand people homeless can you send us any government aid?"" The telegrams were sent via horse to the nearby town of New Westminister. Shortly after, word arrived that relief supplies from New Westminister were being sent in wagons. At this time most Vancouver residents had gathered at Hastings Mill or False Creek. Mayor MacLean instructed the survivors to gather at Westminister Bridge to await the relief supplies. An impromptu bivouac was set up with tents and lean-tos made with large branches.  At around midnight, supplies arrived from New Westminister and Port Moody (an eastern township on the Burrard Inlet).


=== Damage ===
Between 600 and 1,000 buildings were destroyed by the fire̳, with few surviving the blaze. The Regina Hotel at the north of the city survived, as did the Bridge Hotel at the south-east. A side building of the Bridge Hotel was used as a makeshift morgue. According to Alderman Gallagher, a Vancouver businessman, who witnessed the fire and the aftermath, there were 21 bodies (or parts thereof) found immediately after the fire, while others were discovered during the cleanup and rebuilding. The exact number of dead is unknown, mostly because Vancouver's population at this time was constantly changing due to its rapid expansion as well as the transient nature of many of the mill workers.


=== Newspaper reports ===
The Quebec Daily Telegraph reported the fire June 15, 1886. It reported five people dead, 1,000 homeless and a total loss of an estimated one million dollars. The Day in New London, Connecticut, reported the fire June 15, 1886, with 50 people dead, 1,000 homeless and a total loss of one million dollars. The Manistee Weekly Times in the June 15, 1886, edition outlined the events of the fire and attributed the blaze to the Canadian Pacific Railway. It also reported that “liberal and prompt” aid was expected from Canadian Pacific. The fire was reported in the June 16, 1886, edition of the Toronto World. It reported 12 lives had been lost, outlined the events of the fire and included a response from the Toronto mayor promising immediate aid. The Montreal Gazette reported June 18, 1938, that a George H. Keefer of Cobble Hill, B.C., claimed he was responsible for setting the Great Vancouver Fire.  This claim is not verified by any other sources.


=== Rebuilding ===
The day after the fire, the manager of the Hastings Mill, Richard Alexander, announced free lumber for anyone rebuilding their homes and businesses after the fire. Impromptu emergency shelters were set up in the few surviving structures. Several blocks of ice found beneath the wreckage of the Deighton House ice shed provided drinking water to residents. The city council set up a temporary tent city hall. A few months later, one of the first brick buildings in Vancouver became the city hall building. The day after the fire, to address looting, Mayor MacLean appointed three special constables, Jackson Abray, V.W. Haywood, and John McLaren, to join constable John Stewart as the first Vancouver police force. The police force operated out of the city hall tent whilst Vancouver was rebuilt.

In the days that followed, the residents of Vancouver set up white canvas tents and small huts and searched the wreckages of their homes and businesses looking for any surviving objects. The CPR Hotel was the first building to be completely rebuilt. Within two weeks, Cordova St from Carrall to Abbott streets was filled with businesses reopening in basic structures. The City Council organised the main streets to be planked.   Within six months, 500 buildings had been rebuilt with many of the new buildings being made from brick.


=== Population growth ===
After the fire, the City Council focused on urban development to promote the growth of the city. The Canadian Pacific Railway played an important role in the growth of Vancouver. It brought demographic and economic growth and was the largest property owner.  In the years following the fire, the population of Vancouver continued to grow, expanding from several hundred people, to 2,000 people within a year and 13,000 people within six years.

72,Vancouver International Film Centre,"The Vancouver International Film Centre is a building in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which houses the 175-seat Vancity Theatre, along with a production room and offices for the Vancouver International Film Festival. Located at 1181 Seymour Street in the city's downtown core, the theatre can accommodate seminars, live performances, film, video and multimedia presentations. 
The building, designed by Hewitt and Kwasnicky Architects, opened in September 2005 just in time for the 2005 Vancouver International Film Festival. In December of that year, the Vancity Theatre formally launched year-round repertory cinema programming. The theatre is sponsored by and named for the Vancity credit union, although prior to the complex's launch the theatre was stuck in a dispute that might have threatened the sponsorship, or even forced VIFF to refund Vancity's entire donation to the project, because it was deemed to be in conflict with the city's official naming rights policy at the time.Renovations in 2019-20, which were completed in time for the 2020 Vancouver International Film Festival, added a 41-seat Studio Theatre for smaller audience presentations, a new media lab to present new media and virtual reality projects, an education suite and a video wall in the complex's atrium.The annual Game Design Expo, hosted by Vancouver Film School's Game Design program, takes place in the Vancity Theatre.

73,Larwill Park,"Larwill Park, also known as the Cambie Street Grounds, is a former park and sporting field in what is now downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  Larwill Park was the location of the bus depot of Pacific Coach Stage Lines and Greyhound Bus Lines from World War II until 1993, when the bus depot moved to Pacific Central Station. Since then, Larwill Park has been a parking lot. The Vancouver Art Gallery has selected it for the location of a new museum building.


== Location and history ==
Bounded by Cambie, Dunsmuir, Beatty and Georgia Streets, the former park occupied a whole city block and was laid out at the time of the CPR Townsite survey in the early 1880s.  It was Vancouver's second sporting grounds, the first being on Brockton Point in what is now Stanley Park, and was used for all kinds of sports.  A house on the corner of the lot was occupied by an Alfred Larwill (""Al"" or ""Fred"") who good-naturedly stored all kinds of game equipment in his toolshed and allowed team members to use his dining room for a dressing room.
Located midway between the city's old downtown around Gastown Hastings Street and newer areas uptown around Granville, the park naturally became a centre for public meetings, the most infamous one was a rally by the Knights of Labour which led to the Anti-Oriental Riots of 1907, with the Beatty Street Drill Hall, across Beatty Street on the block's northeast flank, serving as a stage and podium.  Baseball, cricket and lacrosse teams made use of the field year round. The playing fields also served as military drill-grounds, with the city's first muster being called up for the Boer War using the site for that purpose, as well as for World Wars I and II.  The site was also a main site for rallies of demonstrations by the unemployed and labour organizations in the 1930s.
In July 1943 (during World War II), a ceremony was held to dedicate the park to Al Larwill, some 32 years after his death in 1911. However, later that year, while the men who had used it for sport and politics were away at war and not around to prevent it, the site was converted into the bus depot.


== 2010 Olympics ==
Often used for parking by Canada Post trucks and for film production ""circuses"", the lot was one of two main sites for cultural events and ""nightly celebrations"", although not an official venue, during the 2010 Winter Olympics. In the Vancouver Stanley cup riots of June 15, 2011, violence erupted in Downtown Vancouver following Game 7 of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Rioting crowds entered the lot and multiple cars were burned.


== Future Vancouver Art Gallery site ==
After the bus depot vacated Larwill Park in 1993, it became the only block of vacant public land in downtown Vancouver. It was proposed as a location for various cultural facilities, including the Vancouver Art Gallery. On April 24, 2013, Vancouver City Council voted to designate the property for a new Art Gallery building. On September 29, 2015, the Art Gallery unveiled drawings by architects Herzog & de Meuron for a new museum building. Relocating to Larwill Park will double the Art Gallery's exhibition space. They were to break ground in 2017,
but have delayed construction until funding is secured.

74,Vancouver Harbour Control Tower,"The Vancouver Harbour Air Control Tower, which serves Vancouver Harbour Water Airport (CYHC), is placed on top of the 142 m (466 ft) skyscraper Granville Square in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Built in 1973 it remains the highest air traffic control tower in the world, in the city with one of the world's highest levels of seaplane activity.In 2009 the tower handled 54,741 aircraft movements, the 32nd busiest control tower in Canada. It is also the 8th busiest airport in BC and the busiest water aerodrome in Canada. Itinerant aircraft movements (from one airport to another) for the aerodrome were 54,711 while local movements were 30. The small number of local movements is because float training and circuits are discouraged in the busy Vancouver Harbour.
The major floatplane operators are Harbour Air and Seair Seaplanes. Both of these operators offer scheduled passenger service to Victoria Harbour and Nanaimo Harbour on Vancouver Island. In addition, they fly charters to many small communities and harbours along the BC coast. Other floatplane operators in Vancouver Harbour include Salt Spring Air, Whistler Air and Kenmore Air Services. Floatplanes commonly seen in Vancouver Harbour include de Havilland Beavers (DHC2), de Havilland Turbine Otters (DH3T) and de Havilland Twin Otters (DHC6).
Helicopter activity is also extensive in Vancouver Harbour with the floating Vancouver Harbour Heliport located on the waterfront, east of the control tower. One of the busiest public heliports in Canada, the Harbour Heliport is used by Helijet and other helicopter operators such as Talon Helicopters and Blackcomb Helicopters. Helijet offers scheduled passenger service to Victoria Harbour Heliport and Nanaimo Harbour using 12-passenger Sikorsky S-76 helicopters.
Aviation activity in Vancouver Harbour also includes many overflying aircraft. These include recreational scenic flights, photo flights, banner tows, traffic watch aircraft and police aircraft.

75,Gastown,"Gastown is the original settlement that became the core of the creation of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Currently, it is a national historic site and a neighbourhood in the northwest end of Downtown Eastside, adjacent to Downtown Vancouver.Its historical boundaries were the waterfront (now Water Street and the CPR tracks), Carrall Street, Hastings Street, and Cambie Street, which were the borders of the 1870 townsite survey, the proper name and postal address of which was Granville, B.I. (""Burrard Inlet""). The official boundary does not include most of Hastings Street except for the Woodward's and Dominion Buildings, and stretches east past Columbia St., to the laneway running parallel to the west side of Main Street.


== History ==

Gastown was Vancouver's first neighbourhood and is named for ""Gassy"" Jack Deighton, a Yorkshire seaman, steamboat captain and barkeep who arrived in 1867 to open the area's first saloon. He was famous for his habit of talking at length (or ""gassing"") and the area around his saloon came to be known as ""Gassy's town,"" a nickname that evolved to ""Gastown."" The town soon prospered as the site of Hastings Mill sawmill, seaport, and quickly became a general centre of trade and commerce on Burrard Inlet as well as a rough-and-rowdy resort for off-work loggers and fishermen as well as the crews and captains of the many sailing ships which came to Gastown or Moodyville, on the north side of the inlet (which was a dry town) to load logs and timber. The Canadian Pacific Railway terminated on piles on the shore parallel to Water Street in 1886. From this the area became a hive of warehouses. Carrall Street was particularly swampy owing to it being low ground between False Creek and Burrard Inlet. Bridges overcame this obstacle, and the low ground and beach was slowly filled in with refuse.
In 1886 the town was incorporated as the City of Vancouver. It fell victim to the Great Vancouver Fire that same year, losing all but two of its buildings, but the area was completely rebuilt and continued to thrive. Hastings and Main was the traditional centre of town, and the foreshore became an important staging area with the North and West Vancouver Ferries, and Union Steamships all having docks there. Evans, Coleman, Evans, a longtime merchandiser, had a warehouse; Fleck Brothers, and Koret distributors also had buildings. Department stores such as Spencer's, Hudson's Bay Company warehouse, Woodward's, Fairbanks Morse, Army and Navy stores, and food retailers Malkins and Kelly Douglas traded and were based there.

Gastown found new life as the centre of the city's wholesale produce distribution until the Great Depression in the 1930s. It was also the centre of the city's drinking life: there were 300 licensed establishments the twelve-block area of the former Granville.  After the Depression Gastown was a largely forgotten neighbourhood of the larger city and fell into decline and disrepair as a continuation of the Skid Row area with cheap beer parlours, flophouse hotels, and loggers' hiring halls.
In the 1960s, citizens became concerned with preserving Gastown's distinctive and historic architecture, which like the nearby Chinatown and Strathcona was scheduled to be demolished to build a major freeway into the city's downtown. A campaign led by businesspeople and property owners, as well as the counterculture and associated political protestors gained traction to save Gastown. Henk F. Vanderhorst, a Dutch immigrant to Canadian citizen, opened the 'Exposition Gallery', an art gallery on Water Street which started, flourished and encouraged a flow of other fledgling business startups to boom in the Gastown core. His influence with the revitalization of Gastown was acknowledged in 1976 by being awarded 'The First Pioneer Citizen of Gastown' award by Mayor Art Phillips. ""A key to the city"". Vanderhorst's efforts, in part, pressured the civic, provincial and federal governments to declare Gastown a historical site, protecting its heritage buildings to this day.
A riot between the hippies and the police in 1971 over marijuana has gone into legend, the incident now made public on the Woodwards building, a throwback to the more serious Post office riot of 1938.
Gastown was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2009.


== Today ==

Gastown is a mix of ""hip"" contemporary fashion and interior furnishing boutiques, tourist-oriented businesses (generally restricted to Water Street), restaurants, nightclubs, poverty and newly upscale housing.  In addition, there are law firms, architects and other professional offices, as well as computer and internet businesses, art galleries, music and art studios, tattoo parlours, and acting and film schools.
In February 2013, The Gastown Gazette began publishing local news and stories about the ongoing protests against gentrification in the Downtown Eastside and Gastown area of Vancouver. The community paper has since gathered provincial and national attention for reports on the neighborhood.Gastown has become a hub for technology and new media. It has attracted companies such as Zaui Software, Idea Rebel, MetroQuest, BootUp Labs Entrepreneurial Society, SEOinVancouver and MarketR.Popular annual events that take place on the cobblestone streets of Gastown include the Vancouver International Jazz Festival and the Global Relay Gastown Grand Prix international bicycle race.
In June 2004, Storyeum opened in Gastown. It was a lively theatrical 65-minute show that re-enacted the history of BC using eight sets that were all located below street level. Unfortunately, due to mounting debt, the attraction closed its doors in October 2006.


=== Gastown Steam Clock ===

Gastown's most famous (though nowhere near oldest) landmark is the steam-powered clock on the corner of Cambie and Water Street. It was built in 1977 to cover a steam grate, part of Vancouver's distributed steam heating system, as a way to harness the steam and to prevent street people from sleeping on the spot in cold weather.
Its original design was faulty and it had to be powered by electricity after a breakdown. The steam mechanism was completely restored with the financial support of local businesses as it had become a major tourist attraction, and is promoted as a heritage feature although it is of modern invention.
The steam used is low pressure downtown-wide steam heating network (from a plant adjacent to the Georgia Viaduct) that powers a miniature steam engine in its base, in turn driving a chain lift. The chain lift moves steel balls upward, where they are unloaded and roll to a descending chain. The weight of the balls on the descending chain drives a conventional pendulum clock escapement, geared to the hands on the four faces. The steam also powers the clock's sound production, with whistles being used instead of bells to produce the Westminster ""chime"" and to signal the time.
In October 2014, the clock was temporarily removed for major repairs by its original builder, and was reinstalled January 2015.The clock appears on the cover of the Nickelback album Here and Now and is also featured in a scene from the 1991 Chuck Norris action film The Hitman.


=== Nightlife ===
Bars (a different licensing category in Vancouver) include 19 Below, The Cambie, 6 Acres, Chill Winston, Columbia Club, Lamplighter Public House, One Lounge, Revel, The Annex, and The Columbia. Mao Mao Bistro, a former club, has since been replaced by The Greedy Pig. The Town Pump, had been a live music venue since the hippie era of the 1960s. The Blarney Stone is one of Vancouver's Irish-style party houses.

76,Waterfront station (Vancouver),"Waterfront is a major intermodal public transportation facility and the main transit terminus in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is located on West Cordova Street in Downtown Vancouver, between Granville and Seymour Street. The station is also accessible via two other street-level entrances, one on Howe Street to the west for direct access to the Expo Line and another on Granville Street to the south for direct access to the Canada Line.
The station is within walking distance of Vancouver's historical Gastown district, Canada Place, Vancouver Convention Centre, Harbour Centre, Sinclair Centre, and the Vancouver Harbour Flight Centre float plane terminal. A heliport operated by Helijet, along with the downtown campuses for Simon Fraser University and the British Columbia Institute of Technology, are also located within the vicinity of the station.


== History ==

Waterfront station was built by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) and opened on August 1, 1914. It was the Pacific terminus for the CPR's transcontinental passenger trains to Montreal, Quebec and Toronto, Ontario. The current station is the third CPR station. The previous CPR station was located one block west, at the foot of Granville, and unlike the current classical-styled Waterfront station was built in ""railway gothic"" like the CPR's many railway hotels.In 1978, when Via Rail took over the passenger operations of the CPR and the Canadian National Railway, it continued using both railways' stations in Vancouver, but a year later, Via consolidated its Vancouver operations at Pacific Central Station, the CN station near False Creek, and ceased using the CPR station. The last scheduled Via passenger train to use Waterfront station departed on October 27, 1979.Waterfront station's transformation into a public intermodal transit facility began in 1977. That year, the SeaBus began operating out of a purpose-built floating pier that was connected to the main terminal building via an overhead walkway above the CPR tracks. The CPR's passenger platform and some of its tracks were torn up in the early 1980s to make way for the guideway of the original SkyTrain line (Expo Line), which opened on December 11, 1985. During Expo 86, SkyTrain operated special shuttle trains between Waterfront station and Stadium–Chinatown station (then named Stadium station), connecting the Canadian Pavilion at Canada Place to the main Expo site along False Creek.
A private ferry company, Royal SeaLink Express, ran passenger ferries from a new dock on the west side of the SeaBus terminal to Victoria and Nanaimo in the early 1990s, but ultimately folded. In 2003, HarbourLynx began operating out of Royal Sealink's old facility at the SeaBus terminal. In 2006, following major engine problems with their only vessel, they folded as well.
In 1995, platforms were built adjacent to the SkyTrain station for the West Coast Express, which uses the existing CPR tracks. The platforms for the West Coast Express were built in the same location as the old CPR platforms.
In 2002, Millennium Line trains began to share tracks with the Expo Line at Waterfront station. The lines continued to share tracks until late 2016, when an Expo Line branch to Production Way–University station was created in replacement of the Millennium Line service between VCC–Clark and Waterfront stations.In 2009, the Canada Line opened with separate platforms which are accessible via the main station building, but require leaving the fare paid zone when transferring between other modes. Waterfront station serves as a common terminus point for both the Expo Line and the Canada Line.
Waterfront station was one of the first stations to receive TransLink's ""T"" signage, denoting a transit station. This signage was originally installed in the downtown core of Vancouver to help visitors during the 2010 Olympics, as it made transit hubs easier to identify.
In 2018, TransLink announced that Waterfront's Canada Line platforms, as well as two other stations on the line located within downtown Vancouver, would receive an accessibility upgrade which includes additional escalators, as most Canada Line stations were built with only up escalators initially. Construction began in early 2019 and was completed in December of that year.In 2020, TransLink started work on replacing the escalators connecting to the Expo Line. The first step in this project was to close access to the Expo Line from Cordova Street for three weeks in June. The closure forced passengers to access the Expo Line from the Howe Street entrance. Because the construction blocked access to the elevators to the Expo Line platforms, a temporary shuttle bus service between the SeaBus terminal, the main concourse area, and Burrard Station was instated. 


== Architecture ==

Waterfront's main station building was designed in a neoclassical style, with a symmetrical red-brick facade dominated by a row of smooth, white Ionic order columns. The Ionic columns are repeated in the grand interior hall, flanking the perimeter of the space. The main hall features two large clocks facing each other high on the east and west walls. Paintings depicting various scenic Canadian landscapes, completed in 1916 by Adelaide Langford, line the walls above the columns. The Montreal architecture firm Barott, Blackader and Webster was responsible for designing the main station building.

77,Granville Square,"Granville Square is a prominent tower located at 200 Granville Street in Downtown Vancouver's Financial District. Completed in 1973, the building stands at 138.4 metres (454 feet) tall.  The tower and its plaza are located atop the tracks of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and adjacent to Waterfront Station (formerly the CPR station).
Originally built by Marathon Realty to house the headquarters of Canadian Pacific, the building was occupied by The Vancouver Sun and The Province  on the ground floor and some upper floors until 2017 (it is now located at 2985 Virtual Way at Broadway Tech Centre in Vancouver); while Vision Critical occupies the mezzanine. On top of the building is the Vancouver Harbour Control Tower for the float planes landing and taking off on the Burrard Inlet. This control tower is the tallest in the world.


== History ==

The tower was the only completed part of the original, Project 200, which got its name from the 200 million dollar investment needed from the federal government. The project included a forest of office, hotel, and residential towers, laid over the CP train tracks. But its best known for its ""Waterfront Freeway"" a proposed freeway with ramps leading to parking garages under the office buildings, before the freeway heads under the ""Brockton Point tunnel to the North Shore. 
The project didn't go ahead because of lack of funding, and grassroots opposition
Colliers International occupies four floors and is located in the building since 1973.  The current owner of the building is Cadillac Fairview.

78,"Victory Square, Vancouver","Victory Square is a park in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  The square is bordered by West Hastings Street to the northeast, West Pender Street to the southwest, Cambie Street to the southeast, and Hamilton Street to the northwest.  The term is also used to refer to the neighbourhood immediately surrounding the square.


== History ==
Victory Square was at one time the grounds of the city's provincial courthouse, which was torn down in 1911–13 when the new Francis Rattenbury-designed courthouse on Georgia Street was opened (now the Vancouver Art Gallery).  The location had significance when it was chosen, as it stands at the intersection of the old Granville townsite (aka Gastown) and the CPR Townsite, which was the downtown-designated land grant obtained by the CPR as part of the deal to locate the terminus and thereby found the city (the corner of Hastings and Hamilton is the northern tip of the CPR Townsite). An area of 0.9 acres (3,600 m2) out of the 480 acres (1.9 km2) allotted to the CPR was held aside as ""Government Square"" on February 13, 1886. The southwest corner of Hamilton and Hastings Streets is where L. A. Hamilton drove the first survey stake to commence laying out the street system for the city. The Victory Square Cenotaph was unveiled on 27 April 1924
Boyd & Clendenning were contracted by the CPR to begin felling the forest at a rate of $26 per acre and an extra $2 per acre for lopping off large branches. A tangled mass soon built up to 20 feet (6.1 m) thick that was to be the kindling for the great fire that leveled the townsite.It was down the park's hillside that the clearing crews of the CPR entered Gastown a few steps ahead of the firestorm that destroyed the city on June 13, 1886, heading for their quarters in the Regina Hotel at Cambie and Water where they had themselves stored water and wetted blankets as safety precaution (it was the only building in that part of the city to survive the fire).  Until that year, however, the site of Victory Square as with all of the downtown peninsula outside of Gastown had been dense west coast rainforest, with trees standing in dark, thick groves hundreds of feet high and also a small creek (now vanished).
During the old courthouse's tenure the vicinity was the hub of the city's financial and legal district, with the Vancouver curb exchange operating just across Hastings Street, mostly in a passageway cutting the corner diagonally behind the Astor Hotel (see photos in External links). The Inns of Court, a ramshackle and infamously leaky (if decorative) structure on the west side of Courthouse Square, was the location of adjutant legal services and offices connected to the Court House. The Oddfellows Hall and what is now the Army, Navy and Air Force Veterans Hall still stand further south (uphill) along Hamilton Street from where the Inns of Court used to be (now a modernist bank-cum-film studio).  Most of the original main branches of the major banks were within the next few blocks west along Hastings, which in both directions was the hub of the city's shopping district until the completion of Pacific Centre in the 1970s, which severed the old pedestrian link between Woodward's, a block east of Victory Square, and Eaton's, two blocks west (now the SFU Harbour Centre campus). On the south side of Victory Square originally stood the Central School, which later became the original Vancouver Community College (then named Vancouver College), adjacent to which was the city's original main hospital (both were in a brickwork Gothic style).

Even once it was known that the courthouse was to be demolished, major construction continued to line the square where it had been.  The Province, Sun and Dominion Buildings went up in rapid succession in the last years of the courthouse's existence, and remain today, although no longer as newspaper buildings. The maple trees on the Pender Street side of the park are the oldest street trees in the city, planted in 1897.


== Victory Square Cenotaph ==

On the northern side of the square, on a plaza flanking Hastings Street, lies the Vancouver war memorial, the Victory Square Cenotaph.  The cenotaph is approximately 30 feet (9.1 m) tall, and is a triangular edifice whose shape conforms to that of the square.  The pillar is of Nelson Island granite engraved with suitable inscriptions, and is kept continuously banked high with wreaths of flowers and adorned with national flags.
The cenotaph was unveiled by William Reid Owen, Mayor of Vancouver, in the presence of an assemblage of 25,000 persons;  naval, military and civilian, and including the Old Contemptibles, 7th British Columbia, 29th Vancouver, 72nd Seaforths, 2nd Canadian Mounted Rifles, 47th New Westminster, and 102nd North British Columbian Battalions, CEF, and others, on 27 April 1924. It was dedicated by Major Cecil C. Owen, chaplain of the 29th (Vancouver) Battalion, CEF.

To the Glory of God, and in thankful remembrance
of those who served their King and Country overseas

in the cause of truth, righteousness and freedom.
The 24th Psalm was read by Lieutenant-Colonel G.O. Fallis, of the Methodist Church, and the music included ""O Canada"" (Buchan); ""O God, Our Help in Ages Past""; ""Lochaber No More"" (bagpipes); ""For All the Saints""; ""Last Post"" and ""God Save the King"". The first wreath, being the tribute of the Corporation and Citizens of Vancouver, was placed by W.R. Owen, wife of the mayor.

The ornamentations on the stone include one long sword and two wreaths, one of laurels, the other of poppies; both entwined with maple leaves. A stone replica of the steel helmet, as used in the war of 1914–1918, adorns three corner buttresses. A larger wreath of laurels surrounds the numerals ""1914–1918"" at the base of the front. Slots in a receptacle of three bronze maple leaves hold the staffs of the Union Jack, the Canadian Red Ensign, the Flag of Canada, the White Ensign, and RCAF Ensign, always flying, which are placed there by the Royal Canadian Legion and the Royal Commonwealth Ex-Services League, and renewed four times each year.
Of the monument faces; one side faces Hastings Street, the others Pender and Hamilton Streets, and was designed thus by Major G.L. Thornton Sharp, architect, town planner, and park commissioner, to conform to the triangular shape of the park. It is so placed that, when approached from the east, it appears in the distance centrally at the end of busy Hastings Street. The granite was supplied by the Vancouver Granite Co., Ltd., and the erecting contractors were Stewart and Wylie.  Stewart died from the effects of an accident whilst preparing the memorial. The Vancouver War Memorial Committee of 24, of which 12 represented the Canadian Club of Vancouver, and 12 the Civic War Memorial Committee, the whole under the chairmanship of F.W. Rounsefell, pioneer, and with J.R.V. Dunlop, of the Canadian Club, as honorary secretary, were the public-spirited sponsors. The cenotaph cost $10,666.
The engraved inscriptions are:
Facing Hastings Street: ""Their name liveth for evermore"" and, within a stone wreath, ""1914–1918"".
Facing Hamilton Street: ""Is it nothing to you"".
Facing Pender Street: ""All ye that pass by"".
The first, commencing ""Their name"", is from Sirach, Chapter 44, Verse 14.
The second, commencing ""Is it nothing"", from Lamentations, Chapter 1, Verse 12.
The third side represents the continuation of the verse from Lamentations.
In his valedictory address, Major Owen said:
""Those whose sacrifices this Cenotaph commemorates, were among the men who, at call of King and Country, left all that was dear, endured hardship, faced danger, and finally passed out of the sight of men by the path of duty, giving their own lives that others might live in freedom. Let those who come after see to it that their names be not forgotten.""
The Cenotaph continues to be the focus of the city's annual Remembrance Day services.
The site of the Cenotaph is significant because it was at tables at the foot of the old courthouse steps where men signed up for the First World War in 1914—which was symbolic for the enlistees because of the strong royalist sentiment in the city, as it was on the courthouse steps where the main ceremonials of the various royal visits to Vancouver had taken place.  The courthouse was the location of many official ceremonies, particularly the royal visits of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York in 1901 and the Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn in 1912.

83,Yaletown,"Yaletown is an area of Downtown Vancouver approximately bordered by False Creek and by Robson and Homer Streets.  Formerly a heavy industrial area dominated by warehouses and rail yards, since Expo 86 (the 1986 World's Fair) it has been transformed into one of the most densely populated neighbourhoods in the city. The marinas, parks, high-rise apartment blocks, and converted heritage buildings constitute one of the most significant urban regeneration projects in North America.


== History ==

Soon after the construction of bridges across False Creek in 1889, railway yards in the area were developed by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) under the leadership of William Van Horne. Many of the CPR workers were resettled from Yale,_British_Columbia; thus the name ""Yaletown"". Many of the brick railway-era buildings survive to this date.
After the real-estate boom and bust cycles of the 20th century, the area became shoddy and contaminated, and was bought up by the city. After Expo 86, held on neighbouring former-industrial land, the whole area became ripe for development.  The site was sold to Hong Kong-based developer Li Ka-shing, setting in motion the redevelopment process which continues to this day.


== Planning and architecture ==

From the start, the city planners imposed strict guidelines on the development, in particular requiring a substantial amount of development of the public realm, and sensitive preservation of existing heritage stock. In part, the city's adaption of new zoning plans in the Central Area Plan (1991) also aided in the process of rejuvenation by establishing objectives of improving livability and provision for office space within Yaletown, as well as preserving its heritage structures. Thus there are generous areas set aside for parks, waterfront access, community centres, and schools.  Along the shore of False Creek, the Stanley Park Seawall linear park has been continued through the area, forming its southern boundary.
While little or no original housing from the 19th century survives, several older buildings from the industrial days still exist.  Hamilton Street and Mainland Street are the most significant, comprising two intact streetscapes from that era. They are lined with handsome brick warehouses built on rail platforms, many with cantilevered canopies. These have been converted into loft style apartments and offices, with boutique stores, bars and restaurants at the ground level. During the latter years of the dot com boom, these streets housed Vancouver's ""multimedia gulch"" similar to the SOMA area of San Francisco.

Nearby, at the junction of Davie Street and Pacific Boulevard, an old brick Canadian Pacific roundhouse has been converted into the Roundhouse Community Centre which uses the old engine turntable as a small outdoor amphitheatre. In another tribute to the rail history of the area, it also houses Engine No. 374, which pulled the first passenger train into Vancouver in 1887.
Spilling around the central core of Hamilton and Mainland Streets, most other architecture in Yaletown is newly built on the old derelict yards, the vast majority in a uniform glass and concrete high-rise style.  Most of these buildings are apartment blocks.


== Transportation ==
The Aquabus and False Creek Ferries provide passenger service from Yaletown to various stops around False Creek, including Granville Island and Science World.  Yaletown is served by the Yaletown–Roundhouse SkyTrain station on the Canada Line, as well as buses 6 and 23.


== Education ==
The Yaletown waterfront is also home to Elsie Roy Elementary School, the first new elementary school to be opened in an inner-city Vancouver neighbourhood since 1975. Yaletown is also home to a number of English language schools.

The ten Heritage Horns have five facing north and five facing east on the roof of the Pan Pacific hotel. They sound the first four notes of O Canada every day at noon and at 115 decibels they can be heard for miles. They were the brainchild of Les Southwell then designed and constructed by Robert Swanson for Expo 67 and funded by BC Hydro. They were originally on the BC Hydro building and were silent when the headquarters moved in the early 1990s. The horns started sounding again on November 8, 1994 after being acquired and refurbished by Canada Place. Due to complaints the timer was changed from mechanical to electrical soon after to make them accurate. They sounded 26 times during the 2010 Olympics, once for each medal won by Canada. The first was at 7:30pm on February 13 for a silver won by Jennifer Heil. Another notable time signal in the area is the 9 O'Clock Gun across the harbour in Stanley Park.

86,Vancouver Fraser Port Authority,"The Vancouver Fraser Port Authority, responsible for overseeing the Port of Vancouver, Canada's largest port and the third largest in North America by tonnes of cargo, facilitating trade between Canada and more than 170 world economies. It is the principal authority for shipping and port-related land and sea use in the Metro Vancouver region. In 2014, the Port of Vancouver was the fourth largest port by tonnage in the Americas, 29th in the world in terms of total cargo and 44th in the world by container traffic. The Vancouver Fraser Port Authority was established by the Government of Canada in January 2008 and is responsible for the stewardship of the federal port lands in and around Vancouver, British Columbia. It is financially self-sufficient and accountable to the federal minister of transport and operates pursuant to the Canada Marine Act. The port authority and port terminals and tenants are responsible for the efficient and reliable movement of goods and passengers, integrating environmental, social and economic sustainability initiatives into all areas of port operations. Enabling the trade of approximately $240 billion in goods, port activities sustain 115,300 jobs, $7 billion in wages, and $11.9 billion in GDP across Canada.


== History ==


=== Merger ===
Prior to the formation of the new authority, there were three separate port authorities in the Metro Vancouver region: the Port of Vancouver, which was the largest port in Canada; the Fraser River Port Authority; and the North Fraser Port Authority.
Although the ports were financially self-sufficient, the federal legislation governing the authorities generated some inefficiency because the port authorities, legally separate entities, were forced to compete with each other economically for business. This inefficiency came to the attention of the local media in 2006 when it was found that the recently expanded Fraser Surrey Docks, operated by the Fraser River Port Authority in New Westminster, were sitting idle after their principal shipping partner, CP Ships, relocated to the Port of Vancouver, already nearing capacity. Some critics opposed the possible merger as they felt the new authority would not recognize the unique concerns of the Fraser River.To increase the efficiency of the ports of Metro Vancouver, the federal Minister of Transport permitted the three authorities to study the benefits of amalgamating in June 2006. The resulting report highlighted several benefits of amalgamation, and on June 16, Transport Canada granted a ""certificate of intent to amalgamate port authorities"". On December 21, 2007, the government of Canada published a certificate of amalgamation that allowed the three port authorities to merge into one effective January 1, 2008. The resulting entity became known as Port Metro Vancouver.
Since 2013, the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority also merged with Canada Place Corporation, which formerly operated Canada Place as a subsidiary of Port of Vancouver.On April 6, 2016, the port authority dropped ""Port Metro Vancouver"" from its branding and re-adopted ""Port of Vancouver"" to refer to Vancouver's port, while using ""Vancouver Fraser Port Authority"" when referencing activities or decisions of the port authority.


== Major initiatives ==
Container Capacity Improvement Program
The Container Capacity Improvement Program (CCIP) is the port's long-term strategy to meet anticipated growth in container traffic, which is expected to triple by the year 2030. The program consists of projects that both improve the efficiency of existing infrastructure and explore opportunities to build new infrastructure as demand rises. CCIP projects include the Deltaport Terminal Road and Rail Improvement Project (DTRRIP) and the proposed Roberts Bank Terminal 2 project.DTTRIP will result in infrastructure upgrades that would increase Deltaport's container capacity by 600,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units), within the terminal's existing footprint. The Roberts Bank Terminal 2 project is a proposed marine container terminal that could provide an additional capacity of 2.4 million TEUs per year to meet forecasted demand until 2030.North Shore Trade Area projects include:

Western Level Lower Level Route Extension
Pemberton Avenue Grade Separation
Low Level Road Realignment
Neptune/Cargill Grade Separation
Brooksbank Avenue Underpass
Lynn Creek Rail Bridge Addition South Shore Trade Area projects include:

Powell Street Grade Separation
Stewart Street/Victoria Overpass

90,CPR Pier B and C,"With the expanding trans-Pacific trade, the Canadian Pacific Railway needed to upgrade its wharf
space in Burrard Inlet, Vancouver.  When the railway was finished in 1886 a small freight shed and
small pier was built. At the time the CPR leased ships (Parthia and Abyssinia) and thus the volume of freight was low. The CPR then built its famed RMS Empress of China and began to capitalize on the Pacific run. Tea, silks and other wares were moved across the ocean.
By 1910 the volume of trade had increased such that a second generation of crack ocean liners were built. As such the small, utilitarian facilities had been outgrown. A very large, two decked freight and passenger terminal was built in 1927. This was CPR Pier B and C.  Pier A sat immediately to the west and was generally a single decked freight wharf.  B and C was the pre-eminent terminal with a Spanish style, First Class lounges, and dock-cranes.  Gantries and access ramps were also included to allow cars and foot traffic to cross the expanding rail yards at the foot of Granville Street.  Pier B and C sat adjacent to the new CPR Station at Granville Street. It was the premiere wharf on the Pacific shore of Canada—customs and immigration buildings sat nearby to control marine traffic and trade. (other info shows these piers built around or before 1915. The Vancouver Map and Blueprint company shows the piers on its maps in 1921 and 1924. Goad's fire insurance map of 1912 shows the space where the piers are proposed. Wikipedia indicates in other articles, particularly about pier d and its predecessors that these piers were built around 1915. Yet Leonard Frank photos in the Vancouver archives clearly show huge construction projects for the two piers in 1926-27. However these photos show construction of the upper superstructure and terminal front facades. It's possible then that the date of 1927 refers to the upgraded terminal.)


== SS Green Hill Park ==
Vancouver and the Pier had a very close call on 6 March 1945 when the ammunition SS Green Hill Park burst into flames after longshoremen drained a quantity of whiskey and it caught fire. The ship's hold exploded and the fire spread. Fortunately, it did not extend to other holds, which contained ammunition. It was a five-alarm fire, and took the lives of several longshoreman and firefighters. The tug RFM towed the burning Green Hill Park to the far side of Stanley Park, where she burnt out. Green Hill Park was declared a constructive total loss but was repaired and re-entered service in 1946 as the Panamanian-flagged Phaeax II.


== Later years ==
The Pier was used for many years until 1970 when the CPR sold its passenger fleet. The wharf was then gutted and the Brutalist tower built at 50 Granville St.  In the process the pier was sold to the Government of Canada, which erected the Teflon sails of Canada Place for Expo 86.

91,Vancouver Convention Centre,"The Vancouver Convention Centre (formerly known as the Vancouver Convention & Exhibition Centre, or VCEC) is a convention centre in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; it is one of Canada's largest convention centres. With the opening of the new West Building in 2009, it now has 43,340 square metres (466,500 sq ft) of meeting space. It is owned by the British Columbia Pavilion Corporation, a Crown corporation owned by the government of British Columbia. The Centre served as the main press centre and International Broadcast Centre for the 2010 Winter Olympics.


== East Building ==
The East Building is located in Canada Place, which it shares with a cruise ship terminal, and the Pan Pacific hotel. It has 12,400 m2 (133,000 sq ft) of space, including a 8,500 m2 (91,000 sq ft), column-free, dividable exhibition hall, 20 meeting rooms, and a ballroom.
The East Building served as the main press centre for the 2010 Winter Olympics.


== West Building ==

The West Building is directly adjacent to Canada Place and consists of 20,490 m2 (220,500 sq ft) of convention space, 8,400 m2 (90,000 sq ft) of retail space along a public waterfront promenade, and 440 parking stalls. Surrounding the building are 37,000 m2 (400,000 sq ft) of walkways, bikeways, public open space and plazas, for a total project area of 5.7 hectares (14 acres) of land and 3.2 hectares (8 acres) over water. The project also supplies infrastructure for future water based developments including an expanded marina, a float plane terminal, and water-based retail opportunities. The design architect for the expansion is LMN Architects of Seattle, in association with Vancouver firms MCM Architects and DA Architects + Planners. Morrison Hershfield ensured quality assurance and conducted enhanced field review during construction of all building envelope components including innovative curtain wall glazing and green roof. On February 9, 2010, the building was certified LEED Platinum by the Canada Green Building Council. 
The West Building opened to the public on April 4, 2009. It effectively tripled the capacity of the convention centre. The building hosted the International Broadcast Centre for the 2010 Winter Olympics and 2010 Winter Paralympics. Connecting to the centre is the Fairmont Pacific Rim hotel.
Adjacent to the West building is the ""Jack Poole Plaza"" (formerly known as Thurlow Plaza), in honour of Jack Poole, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2009. He was responsible for securing the bid of the 2010 Winter Olympics and 2010 Winter Paralympics for Vancouver.


=== Sustainability ===
The new West Building expansion is certified Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Platinum (LEED) and is designated a PowerSmart Convention Centre by BC Hydro. It was awarded a ""Go Green"" certificate from the Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) for industry-approved, environmental best practices in building management.  The living roof, seawater heating and cooling, on-site water treatment and fish habitat built into the foundation of the West Building make it one of the greenest convention centres in the world. The Centre recycles an average of 180,000 kilograms of materials annually, nearly half of the total volume of waste generated. It avoids canned goods, disposable utensils and dishes, and donates leftover food to local charities.
The 2.4-hectare (6-acre) ""living roof"" is the largest in Canada and the largest non-industrial living roof in North America. The roof landscape is designed as a self-sustaining grassy habitat characteristic of coastal British Columbia, including 400,000 native plants and 4 colonies of 60,000 bees each which provide honey for the public plaza restaurant. No public access is allowed to the roof, which made it possible to create a fully functional ecosystem with natural drainage and seed migration patterns using the roof's architectural topography. The landscape functionally connects to nearby Stanley Park via a corridor of waterfront parks. Irrigation to the roof is provided by the building's wastewater treatment plant. In the event that the roof irrigation demands exceed the capacity of the wastewater treatment plant, make-up water can be provided by a reverse osmosis desalinization plant drawing and treating seawater pumped from the harbour as well as municipal water through an air gap connection to the storage tanks, as needed.
All wastewater from washrooms, retail, and restaurant activities in the building is reclaimed and recycled for use in toilet and urinal flushing, and green roof irrigation.  The treatment facility uses a membrane bioreactor process, manufactured and supplied by GE/Zenon, consisting of two 2-zone (anoxic/oxic) bioreactor tanks (with internal recycle) and an ultra-filtration (hollow-fibre) membrane tank, followed by a chlorine contact tank that serves to remove colour and disinfect the reclaimed water.  The treatment system is designed for an average daily flow of 75 cubic metres (20,000 US gal; 16,000 imp gal) per day, and maximum flows of up to 150 cubic metres (40,000 US gal; 33,000 imp gal) per day. With the City of Vancouver 2012 commercial metered water and sewer rates at $2.803 and $1.754, respectively, the convention centre can save over $21,000 per month in utility fees through water reuse.  One of the biggest operating challenges when the facility first started up was the ability to maintain the treatment plant bacteria in a healthy condition during lengthy periods (e.g. late December through mid-January) with limited wastewater to feed the treatment plant due to limited convention activity and concurrent wastewater generation within the building; however, once the restaurants in the building were established this challenge was resolved.     
The building's heating and cooling system feeds through the deep water of the harbor, using it as a constant temperature base to reduce the amount of energy used for heating and cooling.
Along the waterfront, the shoreline ecology is fully restored from its previous brownfield state and supports a historic salmon migration path. An artificial reef structure rings the building perimeter, consisting of a series of concrete steps. Each step is planted with marine species adapted to a specific depth below the water, resulting in a kelp forest characteristic of the natural shoreline and supporting a diversity of harbor fauna. Underneath the building, which is set on pier foundations, runnels are set into the tide flats creating a tidal ecosystem zone that flushes daily and feeds the reef. 
The site of the expansion is a former marine and rail industrial area, most of which was covered in impervious surfaces and contaminated. The expansion led to a decrease in the site's impervious surfaces by almost 30 percent, mitigating total suspended solids and phosphorus content from stormwater and reducing the site's heat-island contribution.


== Awards ==
In 2002, and again in 2008, the VCEC was awarded the International Association of Congress Centres (AIPC) ""Apex Award"" for the ""World's Best Congress Centre"". In April 2010, the West Building expansion received an Award of Excellence from the Urban Land Institute. It has also received multiple awards from the AIA Seattle chapter.

92,The Drop (sculpture),"The Drop is a steel sculpture resembling a raindrop designed by the group of German artists known as Inges Idee, located at Bon Voyage Plaza in the Coal Harbour neighborhood of downtown Vancouver. The 65-foot (20 m) tall piece is covered with Styrofoam and blue polyurethane. According to Inges Idee, the sculpture is ""an homage to the power of nature"" and represents ""the relationship and outlook towards the water that surrounds us"". The Drop was commissioned as part of the 2009 Vancouver Convention Centre Art Project and is owned by BC Pavco.


== Description and history ==
According to the City of Vancouver Public Art Registry, The Drop is a blue 65-foot (20 m) tall sculpture depicting a ""large, gentle 'raindrop' captured in its descent at the moment of contact"". The central ""spine"" of the sculpture is composed of steel and covered with Styrofoam and blue polyurethane. The piece's color complements the sky and contrasts with the large yellow sulfur piles visible on the opposite shoreline.The Drop was commissioned as part of the Vancouver Convention Centre Art Project and marked the first North American project for Inges Idee, a group of four German artists. The sculpture was installed in 2009 at Bon Voyage Plaza (adjacent to the Vancouver Convention Centre) at the end of Burrard Street, along the waterfront in the Coal Harbour neighborhood of downtown Vancouver. The piece was removed temporarily during the 2010 Winter Olympics for interrupting the view of the television cameras.


== Reception ==
The Vancouver Observer referred to the sculpture as the ""quintessential Vancouver piece"". According to the publication, The Drop has a ""playful relationship with the viewer"" and serves as a ""big inside joke"" for Vancouver residents. This refers to the high amount of rain the city receives; Vancouver is Canada's third most rainy large city, after Abbotsford and Halifax, with over 162 rainy days per year.

93,CPR Pier D,"The Canadian Pacific Railway embarked on a series of expansions in the years 1910-15.
These included new railway equipment, ships, yards and the Second Hotel Vancouver.
With the CPR expanding its Canadian Pacific Navigation Company, and it fleets running both
Coastally—to Seattle, Victoria, BC and Alaska—and Internationally—to Japan, China, and Hong Kong;
the CPR needed more wharf space in Vancouver harbour.
It had the CPR pier A which was really a single decked freight shed, and a small pier running
parallel to the shore next to the train station.  Thus the CPR built CPR Pier D on the water
in front of the station. This is roughly the site where the Seabus terminal is now.
CPR coastal vessels docked here. The large wooden dock, in a ""New York"" pier style, was opened
in 1914.
The Pier burned down in Vancouver's most spectacular fire on July 27, 1938. The 
same summer as the Tillamook Fire and the Campbell River fire.  The pier was not
rebuilt.

94,Stadium–Chinatown station,"Stadium–Chinatown (formerly Stadium) is an elevated station on the Expo Line of Metro Vancouver's SkyTrain rapid transit system. The station is located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, at the eastern entrance of the Dunsmuir Tunnel. It is one of four stations on the Expo Line that serve Downtown Vancouver.
As its name implies, the station is located near both the Stadium District and Chinatown. TransLink's Compass Customer Service Centre and Lost Property Office are located at this station.


== History ==
 
Opened as ""Stadium"" in 1985 as part of the original SkyTrain system (now known as the Expo Line), the station was designed by Austrian architecture firm Architektengruppe U-Bahn. The station's original name was based on its proximity to BC Place Stadium. Both the station and the stadium were vital to Vancouver's Expo 86. The ""Chinatown"" portion of the station's name was added in 2004, because local merchants and politicians wished to promote the historical and cultural significance of Vancouver's Chinatown district, located just one block away from the station.During the Expo 86 World's Fair, the station served as a transfer point between the main site of the fair and the Canadian Pavilion (now Canada Place), located on Burrard Inlet at Waterfront station. Transferring between these two stations was free for fair attendees during the fair using special shuttle trains, which ran from a third platform at Stadium station (where there was a connection to the monorail serving the main Expo 86 site) to the Canadian Pavilion at Waterfront station. An automated announcement was aired during people's shuttle ride explaining how SkyTrain and its automated driverless technology operated. The third platform and track were taken out of revenue use once Expo 86 ended and are rarely used except in cases of extreme crowds from hockey games and concerts. The third platform and track are primarily used for training purposes, train storage, special event service, and rerouting during rail replacement.The station was originally constructed with a passageway under Beatty Street to the west in anticipation of future development. When the Amec Building, built across Beatty Street, did not link to the underground passage, the passage was closed and has been occupied by TransLink's Lost Property Office since 1991. The staircase on the west side of Beatty was filled with sand and topped with a concrete sidewalk so that the passage could be reopened in the future.
Until 1988, the Expo Boulevard / Abbott Street entrance was just an open-stair emergency exit. However, with the closing of the entrance tunnel under Beatty Street as well as poor accessibility to Stadium station from False Creek, the emergency exit was redesigned and enclosed, opening in 1989 as the second access point to and from the station.


== Services ==

Important destinations near the station include Rogers Arena and BC Place Stadium, where home games of the Vancouver Canucks, BC Lions, and Vancouver Whitecaps FC are played and other major events are held. Following an event at BC Place or Rogers Arena, the passenger volumes are sufficiently large that it is feasible to post TransLink personnel to collect and check fares at this station, in contrast to the proof-of-payment system that was in force prior to the roll out of the Compass Card. The Queen Elizabeth Theatre as well as the downtown location of Vancouver Community College are located a few blocks away from the station.
Chinatown is located northeast of the intersection of Taylor and Keefer. The station entrance closest to Chinatown is labelled with traditional Chinese characters in addition to English. The sign reads: ""Stadium–Chinatown Station 體育館／華埠（唐人街）"". This makes Stadium–Chinatown the only station on the system to be officially labelled in Chinese. The International Village shopping centre (colloquially called ""Tinseltown"" after the movie theatre on the third floor) and the Chinatown location of T & T Supermarket are located near the station at the intersection of Abbott and Keefer.

96,Sun Tower,"The Sun Tower is a 17 storey 82 m (269 ft) Beaux-Arts building at 128 West Pender Street in Vancouver, British Columbia. It is known for its faux-patina steel dome painted to imitate copper cladding. Nine nude muses, the ""nine maidens"" supporting the cornice line can be seen. The terracotta for this building, including the ladies, was made in Tamworth, Staffordshire, England by Gibbs and Canning Limited.


== History ==
The Sun Tower was commissioned by L. D. Taylor to house his newspaper, The Vancouver World. The intention was that the building would be visible throughout the World's circulation area as the tallest building in the city. John Coughland and Sons of Vancouver had 1,250 tons of steel fabricated for construction.
When it was completed in 1912, it was called the World Building and was the tallest building in Vancouver at 82 m (269 ft), surpassing the previous record-holder, the Dominion Building located just around the corner.  For one year, it was the tallest building in the Canada, until Toronto's 85 metre Canadian Pacific Building opened in 1913. In 1918, droves of Vancouverites turned out to watch as Harry Gardiner, the ""Human Fly"", scaled the outside of the building. When The Vancouver Sun bought the building in 1937, it was renamed. Although The Sun newspaper has long since relocated, first to South Granville then to Granville Square, the building has retained the name.
Formerly 100 West Pender St, the City of Vancouver renumbered the Sun Tower's street address to 128 West Pender in 2011 in accordance with its strict street numbering bylaw when a new building was constructed on the vacant lot at the south west corner of West Pender and Abbott Streets.


== Architecture and materials ==
The Sun Tower was designed by architect William Tuff Whiteway, who also designed the original Woodward's building nearby. The building takes the form of an eight-storey, L-shaped block, surmounted by a nine-storey hexagonal-section tower. The tower is capped by a Beaux-Arts dome and cupola. The structure of the tower is steel, which is dominantly clad in a combination of terracotta tiles and rusticated brickwork. The dome itself, although painted to resemble patinated copper, is steel.
The exterior is adorned with nine terracotta caryatids supporting the cornice, sculpted by Charles Marega. These apparently caused a minor scandal among some of Vancouver's citizenry at the building's opening, as the female figures are depicted partially clothed, with naked breasts, and were considered to be adopting ""sensuous"" poses. Further decorative detailing is provided by carved stone sills under all windows, manufactured from local volcanic andesite from Haddington Island. Haddington Island andesite is also used for some of the decorative carvings near the top of the tower, that feature animal skulls surrounded by garlands of fruit and flowers.

== Future ==
It was announced on March 19, 2008 that the Sun Tower had been sold to new owners on March 17. The purchase price was not announced, but the building had a 2008 assessed value of CA$6.16 million. The new owners promised to restore the heritage building.

		
		
		
		


== In popular culture ==
The exterior of the Sun Tower is used in The CW's superhero television series Smallville to depict the Watchtower, the operational headquarter of DC Comics' Justice League.  In the show the tower is digitally modified to be a clock tower with six turret clocks on its dome, and is enhanced to look taller, being the highest building in Metropolis in certain shots.

97,Woodward's 43,"Woodward's 43, also known as W43 or the W Building, is a 122.3 m (401 ft) tall mixed-use skyscraper located in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.


== Description ==
The building was strongly influenced by New York’s landmark Flatiron Building (Daniel Burnham, 1902) especially in the building’s roof cornice. The building’s design is inspired by its historical context, specifically the neighbouring Dominion Building. The exterior steel skeleton of the screens evokes the steel construction method used in Vancouver in the early 20th century. The roof of the building features an outdoor patio with a small pool and an outdoor garden.


== History ==
Since the bankruptcy of Woodward's in 1993 the original Woodward's Building remained vacant except for a housing occupation in 2002 that initiated the redevelopment process. In 2003, the City of Vancouver, led by City Council member Jim Green, purchased the original Woodward's Building from the province for $5 million, and began a public consultation process, asking the community what they wanted from the redevelopment. After a two-stage competition between three developers in September 2004, the city selected Westbank Projects/Peterson Investment Group to develop the project together with architecture firm of Henriquez Partners lead by Gregory Henriquez and structural engineers Glotman Simpson Consulting Engineers. The 400 million dollar, nearly one million square foot project, includes 536 market housing units, 125 singles non-market housing units to be operated by PHS Community Services, 75 family non-market housing units to be operated by Affordable Housing Society, Nesters Market, London Drugs, TD Canada Trust, the National Film Board of Canada and civic offices, a daycare, public atrium and plaza, and a new 130,000 square foot addition to Simon Fraser University's downtown campus, the SFU School for Contemporary Arts.Redevelopment was seen by many as a key to revitalizing the Downtown Eastside, but the demolition of the structure in 2006 and redevelopment of the site has been met with much local resistance from the existing residents of the neighborhood. The Woodward's redevelopment is now complete with many residents and businesses now in the buildings.
The market housing units constructed in the building feature both modern-look finishes and vintage analog thermostats. The oldest part of the complex (built 1903–1908) was restored, and serves as a non-profit office and community space (31,500 sf), with tenants including W2 Community Media Arts. The development permit for construction was issued on January 26, 2007, and while substantial completion was scheduled for June 2010, delays pushed that completion date back to September 2010.The ""W"" neon sign, which topped the building on the Eiffel Tower replica, was removed before the demolition and was replicated and re-installed on January 9, 2010, now boasting energy-saving LED lights. The original W is now displayed in the open area next to The Charles Bar at the new Woodward's Building. In 2008 the Vancouver artist Stan Douglas completed a 30' by 50' image on glass depicting the Gastown Riots of 1971. The over-sized photograph, together with a basketball hoop, has become the central focus within the atrium of the new Woodward's Redevelopment.
The redevelopment of the Woodward's site had the side-effect of displacing some of Vancouver's sex worker population; however, prostitutes remain in the Downtown Eastside area.

98,2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony,"The closing ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics took place on February 28, 2010, beginning at 5:30 pm PST (01:30 UTC, March 1) at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was the first Olympic Closing Ceremony held in an indoor venue since the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo.


== Program ==
The production's director David Atkins previously directed the Sydney 2000 Olympic and the 2006 Doha Asian Games ceremonies. The choreographer for the finale was Jean Grand-Maître, artistic director of the Alberta Ballet.


=== Pre-ceremony activities ===
A joke was made about the hydraulic system failure with the indoor cauldron in the opening ceremony. Electrical sparks, a fake chicken and feathers shot out of the hole where the fourth arm would have risen. After this, Québécois clown and mime Yves Dagenais, dressed in workmen's clothing, climbed out of the hole, plugged two long cords together, and pretended to pull the fourth pillar out as it emerged. Dagenais then ""summoned"" Catriona Le May Doan (who appeared from underneath the stage via an elevated trap door), holding a lit torch in her hand. She looked around, acting bewildered, and then saw Dagenais, and he happily presented to her the emerging fourth pillar. He then wiped his brow with a red handkerchief to signify a job well done and walked off the stage. After the pillar was in place, Le May Doan, who had been left out of the lighting of the cauldron in the opening ceremony because of the failure, saluted the audience by holding her torch in the air, walked over toward the pillar and was finally able to light the cauldron, to great fanfare from the audience. With the entire cauldron lit, Le May Doan saluted the audience again and then descended back underneath the stage.A mass of white-clad high school students with snowboards flocked out and surrounded the cauldron while the band Inward Eye gave a performance, with the Vancouver Youth Symphony Orchestra behind them. This took place during the countdown, which was followed by the release of fireworks in BC Place. After the countdown and fireworks, the anthem cast created the words Strong and Free followed by a maple leaf and then a circle (called the Death Star by the Anthem Cast) surrounding the cauldron to welcome the official party. After O Canada was sung, the cast did a droplet formation before creating a snowflake, a heart, and a peace sign before exploding up the voms.
Chief Leonard Andrew of the Lil'wat, Chief Ernie Campbell of the Musqueam, Chief Bill Williams of the Squamish, and Chief Justin George of the Tsleil-Waututh were welcomed. Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister of Canada and IOC president Jacques Rogge were then introduced.


=== National anthem ===
A bilingual rendition of the Canadian national anthem O Canada was sung by the Anthem Cast, The Vancouver Youth Symphony Orchestra, & Inward Eye.


=== Entrance of the flag bearers and the parade of the athletes ===
The flag bearers for the participating nations then entered the stadium at the same time, making a ring around the Olympic Cauldron. Following tradition, the athletes entered the stadium in no particular order to parade around the Olympic Cauldron at the centre of the stadium, before filing out to take their reserved front row seats.


==== Flag bearers ====


=== Musical portion ===
Three musicians, Eva Avila, Nikki Yanofsky, and Derek Miller, each on an elevated, lighted column that rose out of the stadium floor, sang the song ""Let's Have a Party"" in French and English.


=== Medal ceremony ===
As with tradition, the medals to one of the marquee events of the Winter Games – men's 50 km classical cross-country – were presented during the closing ceremony. The race was held earlier that day in Whistler Olympic Park. The medals were given by Gerhard Heiberg, IOC member for Norway and member of the Executive Commission of the IOC. The flowers were given by the Ski Federation.


=== Recognitions ===
Two new members of the IOC, Angela Ruggiero (USA) and Adam Pengilly (UK), were announced. The volunteers who made the games possible were also recognized.


=== Greek national anthem ===
A Royal Canadian Mounted Police honour guard raised the Greek national flag while the Greek national anthem was then sung by Greek-Canadian opera singer Ariana Chris.


=== Olympic Hymn ===
Canadian tenor Ben Heppner, born in British Columbia and singer of O Canada at the 2006 closing ceremony in Torino, then sang the Olympic Hymn, mixing English and French, while an RCMP honour guard lowered the Olympic flag. This flag was raised again in London on July 27, 2012 during the opening ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics.


=== Handover of the Olympic flag ===
The Olympic flag was handed off by Gregor Robertson, the mayor of Vancouver, to Jacques Rogge, the President of the IOC. It was then handed off to the mayor of Sochi, Anatoly Pakhomov, whose city will host the 2014 Winter Olympics. The flag arrived in Sochi at the end of March and was raised at that city's municipal building until the 2014 games. During that time, the orchestra played an excerpt from the Olympic Fanfare and Theme by John Williams. Russian Armed Forces honor guards then entered the stadium, carrying the Russian Flag. They passed the flag to the honor guards of the RCMP. The flag was raised Russian national anthem was sung by the Moscow State Chamber Choir, conducted by Vladimir Minin.


=== Greetings from Sochi ===
A demonstration was then staged by the Russians to showcase the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The segment featured Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova in a video. Maria Guleghina  performed while riding on a special troika containing white neon horses, the principal dancers of the Kirov, Bolshoi and Mariinsky ballets, 2006 Olympic champions Tatiana Navka and Roman Kostomarov ice dancing by the Black Sea, giant zorbs rolling around the stage, the appearance of figure skaters Evgeni Plushenko and Irina Rodnina with ice hockey players Alexander Ovechkin and Vladislav Tretiak (four years later, Rodnina and Tretiak began to light the cauldron in Sochi), and a live orchestra performance playing in Red Square while being conducted, via satellite, by Valery Gergiev at BC Place.


=== Games declared closed ===
The games were formally closed by International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge calling them ""excellent and very friendly"" in his tradition of assigning each games their own identity in closing comments. Rogge also addressed the tragic loss of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili, who died in an accident at the Whistler Sliding Centre on February 12, in his comments, stating his condolences for the country of Georgia, and that his memory ""will always be with us."" John Furlong, chair of VANOC, also spoke.Neil Young sang ""Long May You Run"" while the Olympic flame was extinguished in both the indoor and outdoor cauldrons. After both flames were extinguished, all four legs of the indoor cauldron descended to the ground.


== Cultural section ==
William Shatner, Michael J. Fox and Catherine O'Hara came onto the stadium floor and delivered comedic monologues playing on stereotypes of Canadians. O'Hara's section involved the tendency of Canadians to be overly polite and apologetic. Shatner's section involved beer. Fox's section involved urban areas and terrain.
The theme of satirizing Canadian clichés continued with Michael Bublé dressed as a Mountie performing ""The Maple Leaf Forever"" first straight, followed by four scantily clad singer/dancers dressed as Mounties stripping his Mountie uniform to reveal a tuxedo leading to a whimsical Vegas-style arrangement of the song as a procession of giant Mounties, dancing Mounties, hockey players, giant table hockey players wearing gold medals (as Canada won both the men's and women's tournaments), complete with a child dressed as a puck for said game, followed by voyageurs and lumberjacks in dancing canoes, bare-midriff dancing and ceiling hung maple leaves, and last but not least, several giant inflatable beavers and flying moose. ""The Maple Leaf Forever"" was sung using a modern version rather than its traditional lyrics and was arranged in a medley with other pieces. Hockey Night in Canada's former, but still iconic, signature tune, ""The Hockey Theme"", was played during the giant-sized hockey match. The entrance of the voyageurs was accompanied by the traditional French-Canadian song ""Envoyons d'l'avant nos gens"" performed by La Bottine Souriante, while the cultural section ended with Bublé singing the last line of ""O Canada"". Audience members were provided with and encouraged to wear headgear fashioned into moose antlers.


== Concert section ==
Nickelback opened the concert section with ""Burn It to the Ground"".
Avril Lavigne, who performed ""Who Knows"" during the closing ceremony of the Torino Olympics, performed ""My Happy Ending"" and ""Girlfriend"" afterwards.
Alanis Morissette performed ""Wunderkind"".
Simple Plan performed ""Your Love Is a Lie""
Hedley performed ""Cha-Ching""
Marie-Mai performed ""Emmène-moi"" (Take me along)
k-os performed ""Eye Know Something"" with various Vancouver-area hip-hop dancers, including members of Now or Never Crew, Xtreme Soul Style, freshh, and Style-O-Phonics.
Invented instrument ensemble Scrap Arts Music performed an abridged version of ""Phonk"" in the closing minutes of the concert section.


== Notable attendees ==
Aside from celebrities participating in the ceremony, mayors Robertson and Pakhomov, and members of the International Olympic Committee, the following notable people were in attendance:

Michaëlle Jean, Governor General of Canada
Stephen Harper, Prime Minister of Canada
Gordon Campbell, Premier of British Columbia
Chief Leonard Andrew of the Lil'wat Nation
Chief Ernie Campbell of the Musqueam Indian Band,
Chief Bill Williams of the Squamish Nation
Chief Justin George of the Tsleil-Waututh First Nation
Janet Napolitano, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security
Kathleen Sebelius, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human ServicesThe Canadian TV network CTV claimed that traditionally a senior government representative of the country hosting the next Winter Olympics is also present during the Closing Ceremony, but neither Russian President Dmitry Medvedev nor Prime Minister Vladimir Putin attended. CTV speculated that this was due to domestic discontent over their nation's performance in Vancouver. In comparison, Canada's Governor General Michaëlle Jean had attended the Torino Olympics closing ceremony.


== Anthems ==
 Canadian National Anthem performed by Inward Eye
 Greek National Anthem performed by Ariana Chris,
 Olympic Hymn performed by Ben Heppner
 Russian National Anthem performed by the Moscow State Chamber Choir conducted by Vladimir Minin


== Television broadcast ==

In Australia coverage was carried on the Nine Network and Foxtel.
In Canada, CTV, Omni Television, Rogers Sportsnet, TSN, RDS and V broadcast the ceremony live. However, there were lengthy commercial breaks during the broadcast, one of which excluded the entrance of the Canadian athletes when returning live. Furthermore, the Canadian broadcast also omitted the men's 50 km classical cross-country medal ceremony and the subsequent Norwegian national anthem.  The broadcast was the second-most watched event in Canadian television history, with an estimated 24.5 million people watching some part of the ceremonies (of a population of ~ 34 million).
In China, CCTV-1 and CCTV-5 broadcast the ceremony.
In Brazil, only Sportv broadcast the ceremony live. Rede Record and Record News broadcast the ceremony 90 minutes after its conclusion, in order not to interfere with its prime-time schedule.
In Germany, ZDF carried the closing ceremony. Because of the time difference, it was 3:30 clock in the morning.
In Hong Kong, Cable TV Hong Kong broadcast the Closing Ceremony.
In Mexico, XEIMT-TV Canal 22 broadcast the ceremony live.
In Norway, NRK broadcast the ceremony live.
In Russia, Russia 1 broadcast the ceremony live.
In the UK and Ireland, the BBC and British Eurosport broadcast the Closing Ceremony.
In the United States, NBC broadcast the Closing Ceremony with coverage starting at 7:00 pm EST. NBC abruptly ended Olympic coverage at 10:30 pm EST, to broadcast the debut of The Marriage Ref, and resumed at 11:35 pm EST after late local news. This spawned outbursts from upset viewers, especially on Twitter.


== Soundtrack ==
Sounds of Vancouver 2010: Closing Ceremony Commemorative Album (French: Musique de Vancouver 2010 : L'album commémoratif de la cérémonie de clôture des Jeux), the soundtrack for the closing ceremony, was released on the iTunes Store on March 1, 2010. It charted at #17 on the Canadian Albums Chart. ""Un peu plus haut, un peu plus loin"", performed by Garou is the only track from the opening ceremony included.

99,BC Place,"BC Place is a multi-purpose stadium located at the north side of False Creek, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is owned and operated by the BC Pavilion Corporation (PavCo), a crown corporation of the province. It is currently the home of the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League (CFL), Vancouver Whitecaps FC of Major League Soccer (MLS) and the annual Canada Sevens (part of the World Rugby Sevens Series) as well as the BC Sports Hall of Fame. The stadium also served as the main stadium for the 2010 Winter Olympics and 2010 Paralympics which Vancouver hosted, the 2012 CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifying Tournament, as well as a venue for multiple matches including the championship match for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.
The stadium opened on June 19, 1983, and was built as an indoor structure with an air-supported roof, the largest of its kind in the world upon its opening. Following the 2010 Winter Olympics, BC Place was closed for 16 months as part of an extensive revitalization, the centrepiece of which was replacing the inflatable roof with a retractable roof supported by cables. Once construction was completed, the stadium's new roof was also the largest of its type.

Construction of the stadium started in 1981, with Dillingham Construction contracted to build the stadium, designed by architecture firm Studio Phillips Barratt, Ltd. BC Place was built as part of the preparations for the 1986 World's Fair, Expo 86. Upon its completion in 1983, the stadium was the world's largest air-supported domed stadium until May 4, 2010 when it was deflated for the last time in preparation for the erection of its new retractable roof, designed by structural engineers Geiger Berger Associates. Its original air-supported design was similar to the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which was home to both the Minnesota Twins Major League Baseball team and the Minnesota Vikings National Football League team.
The stadium held its grand opening on June 19, 1983. The first major event held in the stadium came the next day, June 20, 1983, when the Vancouver Whitecaps hosted the Seattle Sounders in a North American Soccer League game with attendance announced at 60,342. On June 23, 1983, the BC Lions played their first game at the new stadium, a preseason 41–19 victory against the Calgary Stampeders with 53,472 in attendance. A month later, on July 24, 1983, a crowd of 41,810 watched the BC Lions defeat the Saskatchewan Roughriders 44–28 in the Lions' first regular season game at the stadium. The venue would host the Soccer Bowl '83 later that year. On September 18, 1984 Pope John Paul II addressed an over-capacity crowd for ""A Celebration of Life"". The celebration was part of the papal visit to the Archdiocese of Vancouver. It was one of the most heavily attended events in the stadium. The Pope's Celebration of Life was followed a few months later by the Canadian Pacific Billy Graham Crusade, which drew similar numbers each night.
The stadium was then used for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1986 World Exposition on Transportation and Communication (Expo '86). Accepting an invitation by the Province of British Columbia, their Royal Highnesses Prince Charles and Princess Diana made themselves available to take part in the opening ceremonies. To great fanfare, they officially proclaimed the World's Fair open on May 2, 1986. In 1987, an exhibition match of Australian rules football was played at the stadium and drew a crowd of 32,789  –  a record for the largest AFL/VFL crowd outside of Australia. The stadium also held an NFL exhibition game in 1998 when the San Francisco 49ers beat the Seattle Seahawks 24–21 in the American Bowl.


=== 2007 roof deflation ===
On January 5, 2007, snow accumulated on the air-supported Teflon Fibreglass roof, despite strict zero accumulation of ice guidelines and ice accumulation structural warnings. The accumulation caused a tear in the roof's ETFE-coated fabric close to Gate G on the south side where the roof meets the top of the concrete bowl. The tear grew quickly as air escaped through it, whereupon maintenance staff performed an intentional, controlled deflation to protect the integrity of the roof's intact fabric panels. As it was designed to do, the deflated roof rested on its steel support cables 6 metres (20 ft) above the seating and the field. Normally, the roof had a rise of 27 metres (90 ft) above the top of the bowl when inflated. No one was injured during the incident, although rain and melted snow flooded the bowl and subsequently had to be pumped out.
An independent report indicated that an accidental rapid pressurization combined with lightly gusting wind and a location of previously undetected damage caused the tear. The damaged panel was replaced with a temporary one on January 19 and the roof was re-inflated. The BC Contractors Association held an exhibition in the stadium over the week of January 23, during which the roof leaked in several places when it rained. The temporary panel was successfully replaced with a permanent one in June 2007, just prior to the start of the 2007 CFL season.


=== Renovation and roof replacement ===

On May 16, 2008, it was announced that over $150 million in major renovations would be carried out on BC Place Stadium. The work was done in two phases. The first phase involved upgrades to seating, washrooms, concessions, and luxury suites, as well as the reinforcement of the existing ring beam at the top of the building and was completed in October 2009, in time for the 2010 Winter Olympics.
Work on the retractable roof began in May 2010, with PCL Westcoast Constructors Inc. contracted to construct the roof designed by architecture firm Stantec Architecture Ltd. and structural engineering firm Geiger Engineers, with Schlaich Bergermann & Partner serving as consulting engineers and Genivar, Inc. acting as services engineers. Geiger also designed the stadium's new centre-hung scoreboard. The roof's construction began immediately after the completion of the 2010 Winter Paralympics and the final deflation of the air-supported roof. The official budget for the completed Phase 1 upgrades plus the revitalization project was $514 million. The new roof, a cable-supported retractable roof system first used with the Commerzbank-Arena in Frankfurt, Germany, is the largest of its kind. The opening measures 100 by 85 metres (109 by 93 yd), the same size as the field below. The fabric roof retracts into and is hidden by a pod in the centre of the opening, above the suspended videoboard.The updated stadium also features the second largest centre-hung high definition scoreboard in North America, after the one in the Dallas Cowboys Stadium (since renamed AT&T Stadium). In addition, a new artificial turf developed by Polytan was installed at an estimated cost of $1.2 million. It is designed to achieve FIFA 2-star certification, the highest rating possible. The soccer pitch is 117 by 75 yards (107 by 69 m).TSN analyst and former CFL player Chris Schultz praised both the design and engineering of the new stadium. Columnist Brian Hutchinson has praised the renovations for significantly improving the acoustics, and providing a bright and airy feel to the stadium. These were aspects that were missing in its previous air-supported roof incarnation, as well as the Montreal Olympic Stadium and the Rogers Centre (formerly SkyDome).The artificial turf installed between September 2011 and April 2015 drew criticism, notably its lacklustre characteristics for playing professional level soccer. A new artificial turf was installed in May 2015, prior to the FIFA Women's World Cup Canada 2015. The total cost of the turf upgrade was $1.327 million, with Canada Soccer and Rugby Canada contributing $500,000 CDN to the project. Liam Middleton, Canada's Rugby Sevens coach, stated that the new surface was ""better than some natural grass surfaces they've played on.""


==== Summary of renovations ====
New retractable roof is the largest cable supported retractable roof in the world.
Revolving doors replaced with clear glass doors, which allows the stadium to be accessed much more easily.
Old brown glass around building replaced with light green glass which lets more light in and makes stadium brighter.
BC Lions locker room completely expanded and refurbished: Old lockers were taken out, sanded down, refinished, and put back in. New cubicles were also put in with individual lighting for players. Locker room also sports a new floor called ""sport floor"".
New synthetic turf, called Polytan LigaTurf RS+, was installed as the new playing surface. Turf has a 1 1⁄4 inches (32 mm) thick shock pad underneath the turf and special eco-friendly BionPro infill.
A centre-hung high-definition scoreboard measuring 68 by 38 feet (21 m × 12 m).
Around the stadium is a new 51 inches (1.3 m) electronic ribbon board, with a circumference of 2,200 feet (670 m).
Added 1,140 new HDTV screens. Screens work through a system called Stadium Vision. Each screen runs on a separate video source, allowing menu boards at concourse concession stands to show game updates to fans as they order from concession stands.
All concourses widened and refurbished.
Added 140 additional portable concession stands. Storage of food and supplies will be in concession stands.
50 fully refurbished private suites and 1,300 newly refurbished premium Club Seats.
Wheel chair seating now at every price point and level of the stadium.
New upgraded washrooms, and access ramps with new lighting.
New state of the art sound system.
New wider seats: seats or 20 inches (51 cm) wide with cup holders on every seat.
New sport lighting in stadium; 10% of lighting is called hot strip lighting. Hot strip lighting gives instant on and off.


=== Post-renovation ===

The opening and closing ceremonies of the XXI Olympic Winter Games and the opening ceremonies of the X Paralympic Winter Games were also held in BC Place Stadium in February and March 2010, respectively. The stadium was the first air-supported structure and 24th venue to host the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics. It was also both the third CFL venue and the third Canadian venue to have served as an Olympic Stadium, after Montreal's Olympic Stadium and Calgary's McMahon Stadium.
The 47th Vanier Cup was the first Canadian university football championship paired with the Grey Cup Festival and played Friday, November 25, 2011 between the McMaster Marauders and Laval Rouge et Or in front of 24,935. Nicknamed ""Best Game... Ever"", it is widely regarded as one of the most exciting Canadian Football games of all time with McMaster winning 41–38 in double overtime. It was the first championship played in the newly renovated facility.
The 2012 CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifying Tournament final between the United States and Canada played at the stadium was the highest attendance for a women's CONCACAF Olympic Qualifying game with 25,427 people in attendance.The 2014 NHL Heritage Classic took place March 2, 2014 in BC Place, with the Ottawa Senators facing off against the home team Vancouver Canucks. It was the first of the NHL's ""outdoor"" games to be played in what technically is an indoor stadium, albeit one of a larger capacity than a typical NHL arena.
BC Place hosted its second major international sports competition, the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. Five group stage matches, two round of 16 matches, and one quarterfinal match were held in the stadium during June 2015, and the final championship match between Japan and the United States was played here on July 5, 2015.The stadium hosted round six of the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series 2015–16 series.


== Tenants ==

Currently, BC Place's main sports tenants are the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and Vancouver Whitecaps FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). The stadium was also home of the Vancouver Whitecaps of the North American Soccer League (NASL) during the early 1980s. The Vancouver Nighthawks, a member of the World Basketball League, played the 1988 season at BC Place. Soccer Bowl '83 was also held at BC Place, where the Tulsa Roughnecks defeated the Toronto Blizzard 2–0. When it was built, the floor of BC Place was too small to accommodate a full-sized CFL regulation field, as a result BC Place became the first CFL stadium to use a 20-yard end zone instead of the regulation 25-yard end zone then in use. Although controversial at first, the smaller end zone proved highly popular with players and was adopted league-wide in 1986.The stadium has hosted the CFL's championship game, the Grey Cup, nine times: in 1983, 1986, 1987, 1990, 1994, 1999, 2005, 2011, and 2014. Notable was the 1994 championship, in which the hometown BC Lions defeated the U.S. expansion team the Baltimore Football Club on a last-second field goal by Lui Passaglia, preventing the Grey Cup trophy from leaving Canada (Baltimore would win the Grey Cup the following year). The stadium hosted the 99th Grey Cup in 2011 after the new roof was completed (this Grey Cup game was also won by the BC Lions at home).The stadium is also built to accommodate a baseball diamond, with retractable seating sections making room for right field. The Vancouver Canadians of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League played several series of games there between 1984 and 1988, including games 1 and 2 of the 1985 league championship series. Numerous Major League Baseball spring training games were also played, including in 1984 (Toronto Blue Jays and Milwaukee Brewers), 1986 (Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, Montreal Expos and Seattle Mariners), 1993 (Toronto, Seattle, Milwaukee and Detroit Tigers) and 1994 MLB season (Toronto, Seattle, Montreal and Colorado Rockies).In the mid-1990s the stadium was planned to be the home of the yet-to-be named Vancouver team, a charter franchise of the United League (UL) which was planned to be a third league of Major League Baseball (MLB).


== Transportation ==

The stadium is served by two SkyTrain stations via the Expo Line and Canada Line: Stadium–Chinatown to the East, and Yaletown–Roundhouse to the West. The False Creek Ferries and Aquabus also serve the stadium, docking at the nearby Plaza of Nations.

100,BC Sports Hall of Fame,"The Opening Ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics was held on February 12, 2010 beginning at 6:00 pm PST (02:00 UTC, February 13) at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This was the first Olympic opening ceremony to be held indoors. It was directed by David Atkins.The event was officially opened by Governor General Michaëlle Jean, representative of Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada. The opening ceremony was dedicated by the Vancouver Organizing Committee (VANOC) to Nodar Kumaritashvili, a Georgian luger who died earlier in the day in a training run. An audience of 61,600 were in attendance at the venue. There were an estimated 4,500 performers.


== Production ==
The production's director was David Atkins, who directed the Sydney 2000 Olympic and 2006 Doha Asian Games ceremonies. The Opening and Closing Ceremonies had a combined budget of $48.5 million (it received $20 million (CA$) funding from the Department of Canadian Heritage while VANOC contributed the rest).  Much of the instrumental music for the ceremony was written by Dave Pierce, Gavin Greenaway, and Donovan Seidle.The music during the ceremony came from the live on-stage orchestra, conducted by Pierce.
On December 15, 2010, John Furlong, the CEO of VANOC revealed that Celine Dion had been contracted to sing the national anthem at the Opening Ceremony.  However, when she became pregnant she cancelled the performance and was subsequently replaced by 16-year-old Nikki Yanofsky.  In addition, Furlong also revealed that ""a famous Quebec composer"" was contracted to provide musical elements to the show.  That composer, whom he would not name, backed out of arrangement months before the Games over what he termed ""philosophical differences.""  As a result, the artist refused to allow VANOC access to his music's rights and the organizing committee had to unwind part of the ceremony.  There is speculation within the media that the Opening Ceremony's cultural show finale titled ""We Are More,"" featuring slam poetry by Shane Koyczan, served as a last minute replacement for the canceled segment featuring the Quebec composer's music. VANOC had also requested the Cirque du Soleil to perform several aerial stunts, however it opted not to as it was already stretched with many U.S. productions.


== Program ==


=== Dedication ===
At 5:59 (PST), a PA system announced that the opening ceremony would be dedicated in memory of the Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili, who had died in a training accident earlier that day.


=== Opening section ===
Giant video screens showed Canadian snowboarder Johnny Lyall sliding down a mountain slope, with the dates and locations of previous Winter Olympic games were recalled in voiceover. As the 1988 games in Calgary were mentioned, Lyall passed through a row of torchbearers in the shape of the Canadian symbol: the maple leaf. This concluded with Lyall leaping through a set of Olympic Rings, while snow and ice exploded off them and into the stadium, and him welcoming the crowd.


=== National anthem ===
A guard of honour mounted by the RCMP marched the Canadian Flag to the flagpost. There a guard of honour composed of Canadian Forces members raised the flag. Nikki Yanofsky performed an arrangement of the national anthem, ""O Canada"", singing in English and French.


=== Welcome by the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada ===

The First Nations in whose traditional territories the games were held - the Squamish Nation, Musqueam Indian Band, Lil'wat First Nation, and Tsleil-Waututh First Nation - were recognized as heads of state and seated directly behind the Canadian Governor General and the Prime Minister. Four Coast Salish welcome poles were raised from the centre of the stadium, and greetings were given to the crowd (and the world) by members of the Four Host First Nations in their respective languages as well as English and French. The arms of the poles were raised in a traditional gesture of greeting to welcome the athletes and the world. Following the greetings, groups of dancers from other main culture-regions of Indigenous peoples in Canada were introduced, including the Métis Nation and the Inuit, as well as the Peoples of the Northwest, the Peoples of the Plains and the Peoples of the East and took places around the welcome poles and a large drum surface between them, forming a welcome circle to prepare for the forthcoming Parade of the Nations and danced traditional welcoming dances as the athletes paraded in.


=== Parade of the Nations ===

The participating countries marched in, with Greece coming first, then the other nations ending with the host nation, Canada. The names of the nations were announced first in French and followed by English, the official languages of the Olympics, which also happened to be the official languages of the host nation. The nations entered in alphabetic order of their country names in English because it is the more dominant of the two languages in Vancouver and in the province of British Columbia.
The team from Georgia was greeted with a standing ovation out of respect for their colleague, Nodar Kumaritashvili, who died in a luge accident earlier that day. The team left an empty space in the processional and left the stadium immediately following the procession. They had indicated they would not participate in the opening ceremony or withdraw completely, but decided against doing so. The team wore black scarves and armbands to honor Kumaritashvili while a black ribbon was affixed to the team's flag. Teams from some countries, including Australia, Azerbaijan also wore black armbands in respect of Kumaritashvili.China, which hosted the last Olympics in Beijing, also got a standing ovation due to the large Chinese population in Vancouver, as did the United States, which received the loudest ovation before Canada entered two minutes later.


=== Athlete Tribute Song ===

Nelly Furtado and Bryan Adams, both themselves Vancouver residents performed ""Bang the Drum"", which was written by Adams and producer Jim Vallance as a tribute to the Olympic athletes present.


=== The Landscape of a Dream ===
The cultural section of the Opening Ceremony was titled ""The Landscape of a Dream"" whose purpose was to celebrate the diverse geography and people of Canada. It was directed by David Atkins and the narration was provided by Donald Sutherland, himself one of the Olympic flag bearers. It featured tributes to different regions of Canada.


==== Hymns of the North ====

A Tribute to Northern Canada After Nelly Furtado and Bryan Adams had finished their performance, snow began to fall throughout the stadium. Performers, dressed in warm, Inuit-like clothes, walked about and mingled on the stage floor. Their leader took his staff and banged it on the ground, producing waves of light rippling on the floor. The northern lights and different constellations of animals appeared. A giant, sparkling puppet (one of the largest puppets ever created) of a spirit or Kermode bear that rose from the stadium floor, and hovered over the performers, who were standing on a simulated ice floe. After a few seconds, the ice began to break up, and the performers ""floated"" to the edge of the stage, where they disappeared. The ice breaking away gave way to a huge arctic sea, where simulated whales swam while breathing until next transition.


==== Sacred Grove ====
Opened with brown Coast Salish welcome poles rising up, symbolizing welcome. Red salmon rose from the floor to the ceiling via the poles, representing salmon spawning.  Foliage appeared on top of the poles, symbolizing a lush grove of trees. Dancers from Alberta Ballet and Ballet BC  assembled around the grove as a quote from My Heart Soars by Chief Dan George was read. Sarah McLachlan, herself a Vancouver resident though born in Halifax, performed her song ""Ordinary Miracle"" while the dancers danced in and around the grove. The ballet dancers also danced to ""Adagio for Strings"" by Samuel Barber as the grove turned into a starry sky. All turned white and the performers rose to the ceiling after this piece finished.


==== Rhythms of the Fall ====
This tribute to the fiddling traditions of Canada paying homage to the Anglo-Celtic roots of European Canadian settler culture began with the appearance of the horned fiddler in a flying canoe, a reference to the story of the Chasse-galerie, where the Devil rode a magical canoe. As the canoe descended from the ceiling, the opening of the song ""The Old Ways"" was performed by Loreena McKennitt.

Fiddler/aerialist Colin Maier, dressed as the Devil from the French-Canadian folk legend, attired in stylized Celtic clothing, dueled with his shadow that appears on the moon (a pre-recorded projection of Colin fiddling and dancing a brief jig). The stage was here covered with big red maple leaves, and Colin's cape was also a large leaf itself. The song played during this sequence are the first moments of ""The Old Ways"".
There were six lead ""Hero Fiddlers"" on the centre stage: Andre Brunet (of Le Vent du Nord, representing Quebec), Daniel Lapp (representing British Columbia, where Vancouver is located), Sierra Noble (representing the Métis fiddle), Samantha Robichaud (representing Acadian/Cape Breton fiddling), April Verch (from Ontario, despite representing the Prairies) and famous Cape Breton fiddler Ashley MacIsaac.
Surrounding the Hero Fiddlers are a group of tap dancers representing the Canadian stepdance traditions, dressed in costumes matching those worn by each fiddler. When the five Hero Fiddlers start performing together, the dancers break into a ceilidh polka.
A tap dancer, Brock Jellison, dressed in a hybrid costume of the Hero Fiddlers' outfits, called a river to encircle the main podium. At this point, a group of ""Hero Tappers"" placed above the ""river"" join into a modern urban tap routine, transitioning the folk sequences to contemporary Canada and urban Vancouver.
During the segment, fiddler Calvin Vollrath, who was sitting next to the orchestra, performed ""Fiddle Nation"", a tune he'd composed; each segment represents a certain fiddling style in Canada.
This portion of the ceremony was concluded by Ashley MacIsaac who performed his Celtic punk rendition of the traditional 19th century Scottish strathspey tune ""Devil in the Kitchen"". While Ashley performed, the Hero Tappers turned on sparklers on their tap shoes.


==== Who Has Seen the Wind ====
""Who Has Seen the Wind"" was a tribute to Canadian Prairies. A lone boy, Thomas Saulgrain (L'École Nationale de Cirque) stood in the centre of the floor in a square wheat. A voice quoted from the novel Who Has Seen the Wind (novel) by W. O. Mitchell As the boy began running, he was lifted up and performed ballet on fly wire. A rendition of the song ""Both Sides, Now"" by Joni Mitchell was played during this segment.


==== Peaks of Endeavour ====

""Peaks of Endeavour"" was a tribute to the Canadian Rockies and Western Canada. After the previous segment had ended, a storm was stimulated and clouds seemed to fall to the ground. As the clouds gave away, mountains, resembling the Rocky Mountains, rose from the floor. A George Vancouver quote was read by Donald Sutherland, and skiers and snowboarders hung from wires to simulate going down the artificial mountains. Images of winter sports in action exploded onto the mountains, which finally gave way to sports victories. Inline skaters mimicked figure skaters and speed skaters, circling the artificial mountains as the videos of sports changed to the Vancouver skyline. Coloured lines of light representing flowing traffic surrounded the mountain.


==== We Are More ====
After the mountains that had been the feature for ""Peaks of Endeavor"" fell away, Shane Koyczan performed slam poetry, a variation on his ""We Are More"". (transcript)
Performers formed a giant maple leaf around Koyczan with red flares to end off his section.


=== Opening remarks/Official Opening ===
The opening remarks began with Jacques Rogge, President of the IOC, who offered sympathy for the loss of Georgian luge athlete, Nodar Kumaritashvili.  A welcome from John Furlong, Chair of the Vancouver Organizing Committee, was then delivered. (transcript)  A statement by Rogge followed, mixing English and French. Finally, Michaëlle Jean, Governor General of Canada, declared the games officially open, first in French, then in English.


=== Song of Peace ===

k.d. lang performed a version of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"". While she was singing, doves, the symbol of peace, were projected on the stage floor, and rose from the stage floor to the ceiling via columns to symbolize their release.


=== Entry of the Olympic Flag ===

Former hockey star Bobby Orr; musician Anne Murray; Formula One champion Jacques Villeneuve; Betty Fox, the mother of cancer research champion Terry Fox; actor Donald Sutherland; gold medal figure skater Barbara Ann Scott; UNAMIR commander Roméo Dallaire; and Julie Payette, Canadian astronaut, carried the flag into the stadium. They then transferred the flag to members of the RCMP, who then raised the flag. Canadian opera singer Measha Brueggergosman sang the Olympic Hymn, mixing English and French.
Afterwards, a minute of silence was observed for the Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili's death, during which time both the Canadian and Olympic flags were lowered to half-mast.  Upon learning of Kumaritashvili's death, the Governor General of Canada-in-Council ordered flags on federal government buildings throughout the province of British Columbia, including at all Olympic venues, flown at half-mast until midnight, February 13, 2010.


=== Olympic Oaths ===
Canadian woman's ice hockey player Hayley Wickenheiser took the oath on behalf of all 2010 Olympic athletes in English, while the officials' oath was taken by short track speed skating referee Michel Verrault in French.


=== Song ===
Garou sang ""Un peu plus haut, un peu plus loin"" (A Little Higher, A Little Further), written by Jean-Pierre Ferland.


=== Lighting of the Cauldron ===

Rick Hansen, paraplegic athlete and paralympic medalist, carried the flame into BC Place stadium and lit the torch of speed skater Catriona Le May Doan, who in turn lit the torch of basketball All-Star Steve Nash. Nash then lit skier Nancy Greene's torch who lit the torch of Wayne Gretzky, Hall of Fame hockey player.  Le May Doan, Nash, Greene, and Gretzky then made their way to their four pre-determined locations on the stadium floor to await the raising of the cauldron.
Due to a malfunction of the Olympic cauldron's hydraulic system, only three of the four arms came up before it was lit. Le May Doan's designated arm of the cauldron had malfunctioned, so she stood by as the other three athletes lit the cauldron at the same time by touching the base of the arms with their respective torches.  After the cauldron was lit, a series of red fireworks were shot off in a ring around the exterior of the stadium.  Gretzky then jogged out of the stadium, where he was then driven by police escorts through the streets of downtown Vancouver to light a second, outdoor cauldron near the Vancouver Convention Centre located in the city's downtown waterfront district.  Under IOC rules, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron must be witnessed by those attending the opening ceremony, implying that it must be lit at the location where the ceremony is taking place. Although another IOC rule states that the cauldron should be witnessed outside by the entire residents of the entire host city, this was not possible since the ceremony took place indoors. However, VANOC secretly built a second outdoor cauldron next to the West Building of the Vancouver Convention Centre, and Gretzky was secretly chosen to light this permanent cauldron. Quickly word spread through the downtown Vancouver area that Gretzky was indeed the final torchbearer, and very soon a crush of people came running after the police escort to cheer Gretzky on and hopefully catch a glimpse of him carrying the torch to the outdoor cauldron.The closing ceremony of the games would begin with a tongue-in-cheek homage to the indoor cauldron malfunction, featuring mime Yves Dagenais repairing and finally raising the missing arm of the cauldron, and offering Le May Doan a chance to finally light her arm of the interior cauldron.

== Reception ==


=== Media comments ===
Toronto Star arts critic Richard Ouzounian gave the ceremony a negative review, blasting the proceedings as ""an unimaginatively conceived and loosely executed spectacle that promised much and delivered little.""
The New York Times' Charles McGrath described the event as ""like New Year's Eve, but a tasteful, well-behaved New Year's Eve"", and that it was ""authentically and unabashedly Canadian"".
Cleve Dheensaw of the Times-Colonist (Victoria) described the ceremony as ""moving and memorable.""
Paul Wells of Maclean's described the event as ""sometimes incomprehensible, but sometimes heart-stoppingly beautiful.""
Also from Maclean's, Wayne Gretzky's trip on a truck through downtown Vancouver to the waterfront cauldron was described as a ""redneck Popemobile"" by writer Scott Feschuk.
The Ottawa Citizen's Mark Sutcliffe deemed the occasion ""tasteful but dull, well-behaved and sometimes thoughtful. You've got Canada nailed."" He also found the ceremony lacked a portrayal of contemporary urban Canadian society.
Nikki Yanofsky's performance of ""O Canada"" received mixed reactions. McGrath panned the performance as a ""power ballad"" while Ouzounian deemed it an ""uncomfortable alliance of pop and jazz"". Conversely, Wells praised the ""gorgeously languid"" singing while Alex Strachan of Canwest News Service also had a generally positive reaction taking exception only to a ""backbeat"" in the arrangement. Trevor Payne of the Montreal Jubilation Gospel Choir took issue with the ""arrangement and interpretation"" of the anthem but also found that Yanofsky was ""gifted"" in terms of vocal quality.


=== Bilingualism ===
James Moore, the Minister of Canadian Heritage, and Quebec Premier Jean Charest both expressed disappointment in the limited amount of French content during the ceremony. The Canadian Commissioner of Official Languages, Graham Fraser, was of the impression that the event was ""developed, perceived and presented in English with a French song."" Fraser's office received numerous complaints regarding the ceremony. VANOC, however, defended the case and said that they had made ""a very deliberate focus and effort to ensure a strong celebration of Quebec culture and language."" They also said that there was a significant amount of French in the opening ceremony. David Atkins said that the ceremonies did celebrate francophone Canada.


=== Multiculturalism ===
There are critics saying that 41% of Metro Vancouver residents are visible minorities yet these groups are mostly absent from the opening ceremony. VANOC CEO John Furlong hints that VANOC would try to address this issue in the closing ceremony.


=== Television ===
The international television audience varied from source. VANOC estimated more than a billion.


==== North American ratings ====
On both sides of the Canada-US border, this opening ceremony drew high television ratings.
In Canada, this ceremony aired on the CTV Television Network and 10 other channels (all part of a CTV-Rogers media consortium), in a total of 11 languages. The broadcast drew an average of 13.3 million viewers across the country at any given moment, and 23 million Canadians, 69 percent of the national audience, watching at least a portion of the 3.5-hour ceremony. It was, for a period, the most-watched television event in Canadian history; these numbers were surpassed on the final day of the Games by the gold medal game of the Men's hockey tournament, which drew 16.6 million viewers.South of the border, NBC reported an average of 32.6 million viewers, making it the second-most watched non-United States Winter Olympics, behind the Lillehammer Games in 1994, which drew 33.8 million, and the third most-watched non-United States Olympics, behind the previous one, the Summer Olympics in Beijing two years before (34.2 million) and Lillehammer, and with 67.5 million viewers watching at least a portion of it, it was the most watched non-United States Winter Olympics, and the second-most watched non-United States Olympics, behind Beijing, as that drew 69.9 million viewers.


== Soundtrack ==
A soundtrack, Sounds of Vancouver 2010: Opening Ceremony Commemorative Album (French: Musique de Vancouver 2010 : L'album commémoratif de la cérémonie d'ouverture des Jeux), was released through the iTunes Store on February 12, 2010, containing many studio recordings of the performances from the opening ceremony. It charted at #6 on the Canadian Albums Chart, and has sold over 50,000 copies. The song performed by Garou, ""Un peu plus haut, un peu plus loin (A little higher, a little further)"", was released on the accompanying soundtrack for the closing ceremony.

101,Empire Landmark Hotel,"The Empire Landmark Hotel, often referred to by its original name, the Sheraton Landmark, was the tallest hotel in Vancouver, British Columbia.  The building was revolutionary at the time as it had a revolving restaurant on its top floor, Cloud 9, which was one of only two revolving restaurants in Vancouver, the other being the Harbour Centre. Between its completion in 1973 and the completion of nearby Bentall Centre in 1974, the Empire Landmark Hotel was the third tallest building in Vancouver.
The skyscraper is the tallest voluntarily demolished building in Canada, overtaking the 88 m (289 ft) tall Old Toronto Star Building that was demolished in 1972.


== Background Information ==
The hotel was built by the oldest construction company on the West Coast, SBW, otherwise known as Smith Brothers and Wilson. Upon completion in 1973, the Sheraton-Landmark Hotel was the third tallest building in Vancouver at 120.1 m (394 ft) and 42 storeys tall. It was also the tallest building in Vancouver completely devoted to use as a hotel.
The Empire Landmark was located on one of Vancouver's busiest thoroughfares at 1400 Robson Street, in the West End of Downtown Vancouver. The site of the former hotel is owned by Hong Kong based Asia Standard International Group.


== Demolition ==

Economic pressures due to rising property values within downtown Vancouver, combined with the building's historically unpopular brutalist architecture and relatively small floor space being prohibitive to redevelopment of the original tower into anything but another hotel, the Empire Landmark Hotel chosen to be demolished and the site opened up for new development.
The hotel and its restaurant closed on 30 September 2017 and the building was demolished, floor by floor, over a period of over a year, beginning in March 2018 and ending in May 2019.The building will be replaced by two shorter condominium towers, at 31 and 32 storeys, with 237 market condos, 63 social housing units, and retail and office space on the bottom three floors.  The development is called Landmark On Robson and is said to help ""breathe new life into the neighbourhood"".

102,HarbourLynx,"HarbourLynx was a private company based in Nanaimo, British Columbia that provided passenger-only high speed ferry service between the city centres of Nanaimo and Vancouver. 
HarbourLynx was actually the third venture to attempt such a ferry service. The first service was operated using a passenger-only hovercraft in the 1980s. The second venture Kvaerner Fjellstrand Shipping (owned by Fjellstrand A.S.), operating as Royal Sealink Express, operated for only 11 months from 1992–1993, using the  296-passenger MV Orca Spirit - the same model of ship used by HarbourLynx.


== Ship refurbishment ==
The HarbourLynx 40m catamaran (previously called the Philippine Kvaerner Fjellstrand Singapore Flying Cat) was built by Fjellstrand A.S. in 1996; after being laid up in the Philippines for two years, the catamaran was shipped to a Victoria shipyard for refurbishment and upgraded to meet Transport Canada regulations while the engines were refurbished by Detroit Diesel in Kamloops.


== Operation ==
After several cancelled sailings due to mechanical issues, on February 2, the Harbourlynx vessel was pulled from service due to major engine problems. On Feb. 20, 2006, it was announced that Harbourlynx had filed for bankruptcy. At midnight March 20, the deadline passed with no resolution.


== Shutdown of service ==
As of October 23, 2006 the company's website indicated that the ferry service may be revived by December under new ownership. No word on who the new ownership is. This never came to fruition. 
The vessel left the safe confines of Nanaimo's harbour on January 1, 2008. She was bound for Ireland, to serve the passage between Galway and the Aran Islands. She was purchased by Fjellstrand, a Norwegian ship building company who will retrofit the vessel and make her seaworthy once again.

103,"St. Paul's Anglican Church, Vancouver","St. Paul's Anglican Church serves the south-west downtown peninsula of Vancouver, British Columbia, (the West End and Yaletown neighbourhoods) alongside Christ Church Cathedral (established 1888) serving the north-east (Downtown and Coal Harbour neighbourhoods).  Both parishes separated from St. James  (established 1881), the first Anglican Church in Granville, as Vancouver was then known.


== Early history ==


=== Church buildings ===
The Anglican Parish of St Paul was established at a time when the population of Vancouver was rapidly expanding.  In response to a demand from a small group of St James' parishioners, a vacant lot was purchased and a daughter church was built in 1889.  The parish was established in 1891.  The church was located at the centre of the geographically-defined parish, but in 1898 it was placed on skids and moved north-west, away from railway yards in Yaletown and closer to where most parishioners lived in the West End.  In 1905, it was replaced by a larger church, and the old church became the parish hall.  
The new church was built in Gothic revival style with pointed-arch windows and doors, following the traditional lines of an English parish church, something that would have been familiar to most of the parishioners at the time, or to their parents. 
The church had eighteen windows (not including clerestory windows), all except three glazed with leaded lights.  Stained glass was fitted in windows in the east wall (portraying St Paul preaching in Athens), the west wall (St Peter with Dorcas doing good works), and the north transept (Faith, Hope and Charity).  Between 1952 and 1964, nine more windows were fitted with stained glass, all in some way portraying Christ.  Until 1952, the only portrayal of Christ in the church had been a print showing Jesus as a small boy.The church pipe organ, Opus 264 by Casavant Frères of Québec, is said to be the first to be constructed west of the Rockies.The old church was replaced by a new parish hall and a rectory in 1911.  In 1929, the rectory was re-located to allow the hall to be extended.  By then, the site at the corner of Jervis Street and Pendrell Street had assumed its present configuration, except for a wheelchair ramp added in 2002.
Mortgage costs associated with extending the parish hall were exacerbated by the mid-thirties depression. Optimism, and finances, revived after the Second World War and the mortgage was ceremoniously burned in 1945.  
During the 1960s a plan to build a car park was frustrated by the City of Vancouver.  Instead, the parish built, and in 1973 opened, a high-rise apartment building for accommodating seniors at subsidised rents.


=== Parish clergy ===
The first rector, Ernest Flewelling (1891 - 1894), was followed by Thomas Outerbridge and Henry Bowers, both briefly, and then by Harold Underhill (1896 - 1908) during whose incumbency the new church was built.  He was followed by Adam de Pencier (1908 – 1910), who resigned to become Bishop of New Westminster, then Frederick Chadwick (1910 - 1913) and then the seventh and lonest-serving rector, Harold King (1914 - 1944).  As the Second World War ended Godfrey Gower (1944 – 1951) became rector, resigning to become Bishop of New Westminster, and he was succeeded by Patrick Ellis (1951 - 1960) and then Joe Ellis (1960 - 1973).  


=== Parish activities ===
From its founding, the parish thrived by serving a large and relatively prosperous middle-class membership.  The parish followed a traditional Anglican Sunday liturgical pattern of Holy Communion, Morning Prayer and Evensong, and sponsored well-supported educational and social activities like Sunday Schools, Ladies’ and Men’s Guilds, scouts and guides and youth groups.  
Liturgical practice tended to be conservative.  The introduction of a processional cross in 1931 was contentious, and even more so was the introduction of women into the choir in 1933.


== Post-1980 changes ==
As the centennial of the parish approached the eleventh rector, Harold McSherry (1973 - 1984), retired.  In the search for his successor, a profile was prepared describing how the character of the West End of Vancouver had changed significantly since the parish had been established.  The situation was summarised thus: 

""In the 1950s, developers began pulling down the old family houses of the West End to make room for apartment buildings.  The composition of the population changed with the changes in residential housing and the population density increased to become one of the highest in Canada.  Old-style families were replaced by single-parent families, who were joined by previously unknown (or, at least, unrecognized) residents like gays and lesbians and unmarried couples living together.  For most of these persons St Paul’s was perceived as irrelevant, if not invisible, and to some as passively or actively hostile."" 
In 1985, David Crawley (1985–1990) was appointed rector, setting in process significant reforms of pastoral ministries (particularly the services offered by St Paul's to those who did not count themselves as its members) and liturgical practices (the rituals it used in its forms of worship).  


=== New ministries ===
Foremost of all, Crawley initiated a ministry to members of the LGBT community, many of whom were at that time facing the challenges of the AIDS crisis.  He and his assistant priest, Neil Gray who became Crawley' successor (1991 - 2003), opened up the parish to the wider community and co-operated with other agencies like St Paul's Hospital and AIDS Vancouver.  In reflecting upon this experience, Crawley later wrote: ""St Paul's had not so much found a mission as it had regained its soul""As the AIDS crisis receded, Gray set about consolidating the positive response received from the LGBT community by advocating at the 1998 synod of the Diocese of New Westminster for permission to bless covenanted same-sex relationships.  The initiative achieved the immediate success of a favourable vote, but it was not sufficiently favourable to win the consent of Bishop Michael Ingham.  Permission was sought again in 2001, with an even more favourable outcome, leading in 2002 to episcopal consent.  
The result had repercussions throughout the international Anglican Communion, meriting among other responses a rebuke from the then Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey.  Ingham expressed his own position thus:

""In many places around the world homosexual people are still treated as criminals and even worse, and in some instances with the support of the church.  We regret this [. . . ] and express our sadness and disquiet at their suffering, and hope that our actions in this part of the world may bring comfort and relief to those millions of people who look to the church for safety and support instead of judgement and condemnation.""
In 2004, the then assistant priest, Dale Yardy, officiated at the first Blessing of a Covenanted Union of a same-sex couple in St Paul's.In 1995, St Paul's Advocacy Office was established to provide support and information for people facing problems associated with government benefits, tenancy disputes, immigration, and the like.  From its inception, the program has been operated by a salaried director and volunteer associates (most of whom are not members of the parish), conducting as many as four thousand interviews in a year with clients from a wide area.
St Paul's played a major role in the re-introduction of labyrinth-walking as a meditative technique.  In 1997, under the direction of the then assistant priest, April Stanley, a 13-metre, full-scale replica of the medieval labyrinth found at Chartres Cathedral in France was painted on the floor of the parish hall to become the first permanent indoor labyrinth in Canada.  Very soon, the number of individual visits to the labyrinth exceeded four thousand a year, mostly by persons who were not members of St Paul's.


=== Liturgical developments ===
Significant changes to liturgical practices began in 1981 when a contemporary-language Eucharistic rite was used at St Paul's for the first time.  In 1986, a Eucharistic celebration additional to the traditional early-morning celebration (using the Book of Common Prayer) was introduced using the Book of Alternative Services.  At the same time the Eucharist gradually displaced Morning Prayer at the principal Sunday morning service, Morning Prayer being used for the last time in 1995.A survey of the parishes of the Diocese of New Westminster completed in 2015 suggested that these trends were common throughout the diocese.Gray's successor, Markus Dünzkofer (2004 – 2012), made decreasing use of the Book of Common Prayer at the principal Sunday morning service, cutting back to three times a year by 2013.  In 2014, when Dünzkofer's successor, Jessica Schaap (2013 – 2017), discontinued the early-morning Eucharistic celebration for lack of attendance, regular use of the Book of Common Prayer ceased completely.  

In 1986, Crawley moved the high altar away from the east wall so that the celebrant could face the people.  He also introduced a portable altar which could be placed in the chancel or the nave, and he and his successors made increasing use of it for celebrating Eucharist in a more intimate manner.During this period, icons and votive candles were introduced into the church, and an aumbry was installed allowing for reservation of the consecrated Bread and Wine for use in administering Communion to sick parishioners.  Practices like Exchanging the Peace were introduced, together with ceremonies like Washing of Feet on Maundy Thursday, all of which increased the level of participation in the Eucharistic celebration by members of the congregation.Of all the developments, the most significant was the changing role of women.  In 1976, the then Bishop of New Westminster, David Somerville, ordained women as priests for the first time in the diocese.  In 1982, Eucharist was celebrated at St Paul's for the first time by a woman priest, Barbara Blakely.  In 1990 a woman, Helen Patterson, was first appointed to the clerical staff, and she was succeeded as assistant priest by several other women.  In 2013, Jessica Schaap became the first woman to be appointed rector.


== Membership ==
The church was built at a time when church attendance was normal practice, and attendance increased as the population increased.  In 1914, for example, the number of Easter communicants (the customary criterion for Anglican membership) reached almost one thousand.  The second church had been built to accommodate growing membership, and as late as 1928 the need for more seating remained a topic for debate.  The next year, a proposal for a third, larger, church was prepared, but never implemented.The membership was largely (if not completely) of British origin.  Until 1955, St Paul’s was part of the Church of England in Canada, a body referred to in a brochure published in 1929 as “the Mother Church of the English-speaking race”.Since 1955, St Paul’s has been part of the then renamed Anglican Church of Canada/l'Eglise anglicane du Canada.  
As the 1960s passed, membership fell (in step with those of all mainline churches in Canada) but became more diverse in terms of ethnic origin, maternal language, sexual orientation, gender identity, confessional upbringing, and social class.

104,Roedde House Museum,"The Roedde House Museum is a late-Victorian home located at 1415 Barclay Street in Vancouver, Canada. It was the home of Gustav Roedde and his family. The house was built in 1893 and was allegedly designed by architect Francis Rattenbury in the Queen Anne Revival style. After having been a rooming house for years, the house was restored and refurnished in the 1980s and has been open to the public as a museum since 1990.


== The Roedde Family ==
Gustav Roedde (1860-1930) emigrated from Grossbodungen, Germany to Cleveland, US in 1882 where he completed his apprenticeship as a bookbinder. During a Halloween party, he met Matilda Cassebohm (1862-1951), who emigrated from the island of Helgoland, Germany. The two were married in Cleveland in 1883. Together they lived in different cities; San Francisco, California and Victoria, British Columbia, before settling down in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1888. Gustav Roedde's bookbindery blossomed along with Vancouver's quick development. His skills, such as the paper marbling technique, made him a successful businessman. The company continues to operate as G.A. Roedde Printers under new ownership.
The family grew to include seven children and three St. Bernard dogs. The family's first born, Anna Henrietta died at age four after eating poisoned berries. When World War I began, the sons Walter Herman Widemann (adopted) and William August travelled to Europe to fight for the British army and returned safely. During that time, daughter Emma Cather moved back to the Roedde House with her two daughters, Emma Gwendolyn and Kathleen Frances. Stories have been passed down, that the children used to play in the upstairs storage room to hear the adults’ conversations on the lower floor. In 1925, daughter Anna Catherine was killed at age 28, while on duty as a nurse at the Vancouver General Hospital. During the same year, the family moved to a new home on Drummond Drive, in Point Grey.


== House history ==

The house's alleged architect, Francis Rattenbury (1867-1935), was an ambitious English immigrant. He also designed The Empress Hotel and Vancouver's 1910 provincial courthouse (currently the Vancouver Art Gallery). The Roedde House's asymmetrical plans, verandas and turret are all features of the Queen Anne Revival style. Both the interior and exterior of the house are made of cedar and fir, due to the cheap availability of lumber at the time.
In the late 1970s, the house was at risk of being demolished. The Community of Arts Council of Vancouver urged that the building not be torn down due to its historical significance. They succeeded and the house was designated a “Class A Heritage Building” in 1976, which meant that the house could not be moved, nor the exterior walls changed. The City of Vancouver restored the exterior of the house. In 1984, the Roedde House Preservation Society was formed to implement the interior restoration. Historical records were used to insure the house replicated what it would have looked like between 1893 and 1925. Stripping down wallpaper helped discover the original colours of the walls and the house was furnished with all the accoutrements of middle-class life in the 1890s. On May 12, 1990, the Roedde House Museum was officially opened by then-Mayor Gordon Campbell.


== The Museum ==
The museum's collection of over 2,700 artifacts includes furniture, clothing, books and household items; some of which were owned by the Roedde family. Highlights include, the George III longcase clock manufactured in 1775, the upright Steinway piano dated 1893 and other interesting items like the stereoscope, the chestnut roaster and the universal bread maker.
In addition to guided tours, the museum features Classical and Jazz Concert series. On Sunday Tea and Tour, the museum serves the “Roedde House Blend”, made especially by the Metropolitan Tea Company for the Museum.

It is the home of the Vancouver Convention Centre, the Pan Pacific Vancouver Hotel, Vancouver's World Trade Centre, and the virtual flight ride FlyOver Canada. The building's exterior is covered by fabric roofs resembling sails. It is also the main cruise ship passenger terminal for the region, where cruises to Alaska originate. The building was designed by architects Zeidler Roberts Partnership in joint venture with Musson Cattell Mackey Partnership and DA Architects + Planners.
Canada Place can be reached via the SkyTrain line at the nearby Waterfront Station terminus or via West Cordova Street in Vancouver. The white sails of the building have made it a prominent landmark for the city, as well as drawing comparisons to the Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia and the Denver International Airport in Denver, Colorado.The structure was expanded in 2001 to accommodate another cruise ship berth. In 2009/10, for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Canada Place served as the Main Press Centre.


== History ==

Canada Place was built on the land which was originally the Canadian Pacific Railway's Pier B-C. Built in 1927, its primary purpose was to serve CPR and other shipping lines trading across the Pacific Ocean.In 1978 Federal, Provincial and Municipal governments commenced planning for development of convention, cruise ship and hotel facilities. Four years later, the Government of Canada created a crown corporation, Canada Harbour Place Corporation (known as Canada Place Corporation until 2012), to develop the Canada Place project on the Pier B-C site. Construction began when Queen Elizabeth II arrived on the Royal Yacht Britannia with Pierre Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada and William R. Bennett, Premier of BC to initiate the first concrete pour.
During Expo 86, the Canada Pavilion at Canada Place was opened by Prince Charles and Brian Mulroney, Prime Minister of Canada. Among the largest and most elaborate pavilions presented by any nation at any World's Fair, the Canada Pavilion hosted more than 5 million visitors prior to the October 13, 1986 closing date.
Canada Place Corporation (CPC), a Crown agent, continues to act as the coordinating landlord for Canada Place facilities.


=== Events ===
Throughout the year many community events are held at and hosted by Canada Place.


== Pan Pacific Vancouver ==

The Pan Pacific Vancouver opened in January 1986 and has 503 rooms and suites, two restaurants, and a lounge.
The Hotel is operated by Pan Pacific Hotels and Resorts.


== Heritage Horns ==

The Heritage Horns, formerly known as the 12 O'clock Horn, sound the first four notes of O Canada every day at noon and can be heard throughout Downtown Vancouver and beyond. The ten horns have five facing north and five facing east on the roof of the Pan Pacific hotel and have an output of 115 Decibels. They were the brainchild of Les Southwell, designed and constructed by Robert Swanson for Canada's centennial 1967, and funded by BC Hydro. They were originally on the roof of the BC Hydro building (now The Electra) and were silent when the headquarters was converted to condominiums in the early 1990s. The horns started sounding again on November 8, 1994 after being acquired, refurbished, and relocated to Canada Place. Due to complaints, the timer was changed from mechanical to electrical soon after to make them accurate. They sounded 26 times during the 2010 Olympics, once for each medal won by Canada. The first was at 7:30pm on February 13 for a silver won by Jennifer Heil. The Heritage Horns will also be sounding at 7:00 p.m. each evening from March 26 to April 16, 2020 in support of essential service workers across Canada. Another notable time signal in the area is the 9 O'Clock Gun across the harbour in Stanley Park.

106,Greater Vancouver Board of Trade,"The Greater Vancouver Board of Trade is a non-profit organization. It serves Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in a fashion similar to the Board of Trade or Chamber of Commerce.


== Role in Local Governance ==
The Greater Vancouver Board of Trade has been vested by federal and provincial governments with the power to select board members for a number of local governance bodies and institutions. The Board of Trade selects one of the five members of the Screening Panel that shortlists candidates for TransLink's Board of Directors and is also involved in selecting directors for Port Metro Vancouver and the Vancouver Airport Authority.


== History ==
The Greater Vancouver Board of Trade was established on 22 September 1887, to help rebuild after the Great Vancouver Fire destroyed the city. 31 men - composed of merchants, lumbermen, bankers and manufacturers - founded the Board of Trade to ""protect the interests of merchants, traders and manufacturers, to advance the trade of the area and to promote the advancement and general prosperity of Vancouver."" In addition to lower taxes, early lobbying efforts pushed for the construction of schools, a land registry office, a court house, a submarine communications cable to Australia (completed in 1902) and the establishment of mail delivery.By 1952, the Board had grown to ten bureaus and ten standing committees which worked on campaigns, exhibitions, luncheons, educational products, endorsements and representations to all levels of government on behalf of the business community.
In 1983, the Board became a member of the World Trade Centers Association and in 1986 moved into the Vancouver World Trade Centre office complex at Canada Place. It hosted the General Assembly of the World Trade Centers Association the same year.
In 1990 the Board launched its Federal Debt Clock, a 1,500 lb (680 kg), 15 ft (4.6 m) by 10 ft (3.0 m) computerized calculator that tracked the rise in government debt. At the time, Canada's $363 billion debt was climbing at a rate of $53,300 per minute. In 1998, Finance Minister Paul Martin hit the gong and stopped the clock at a special Board of Trade luncheon. The board's debt clock stopped just shy of $600 billion.In more recent years, The Greater Vancouver Board of Trade was one of the leading voices to support Vancouver's bid for the 2010 Olympic Games – hosting workshops and forums to promote the bid, and even flying in a pre-bid countdown clock to Canada Place by helicopter. The Board also successfully lobbied for a revote of the Translink mayors' council to save the Richmond-Airport-Vancouver rapid transit line – known today as the SkyTrain's Canada Line, and was a founding member of the Fair Tax Coalition, which helped the city to approve a one-per-cent reduction in business property taxes.

107,Storyeum,"Storyeum was a short-lived tourist attraction, located at 142 Water Street, Vancouver. Storyeum was located in the largely touristy area of the Gastown neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Storyeum offered up a live, interactive, educational, re-creation of British Columbia's history through special effects, actors and actresses in a 65-minute show.
Storyeum, in the wake of diminishing profits and revenue, ran its last show on October 17, 2006 and has since ceased daily operations. The City of Vancouver continued as the property landlord and occasionally rented parts of the space for events such as Vancouver Fashion Week, the Juno Awards After Party, Vancouver Film School projects, and entertainment and cultural celebrations.
The space sits underneath the Woodward's parkade and with the City's largest revitalization project underway across the street, the Storyeum site has been divided into two retail spaces. At 142 Water Street a German/Iranian furniture store now occupies 12,000 square feet (1,100 m2), and at 151 West Cordova Street, W2 Community Media Arts is operating Storyeum as a 31,000-square-foot (2,900 m2) conference and festival venue, titled W2 Storyeum. Whereas the venue previously housed heritage displays and gift shops aimed at tourists, it now plays host to a community media lab, cafe, art studio, exhibition space, offices, and community meeting room.
Excalibur Entertainment (of Surrey, BC) proposed to turn the basement into a 40+ lane bowling alley but their business model was incumbent upon securing a ground floor liquor permit. This combination made the idea unlikely to occur with the new Woodward's across the street that has a 150-seat restaurant and bar. Creditors went through the approximately 70,000-square-foot (6,500 m2) basement in 2006 for auctionable value. The space is currently being used by Vancouver Film School for student and small production sets, including green screens and one-take live action shots.


== History ==

The Storyeum concept was officially conceived in 2000 by its founder Danny Guillaume and architect Al Waisman. To help fulfill their concept, they founded Historical Xperiences Inc. (HXP) to create and manage Storyeum. Storyeum officially opened in June 2004. Many local businessmen and the City of Vancouver invested over CAD $22 million into the concept, but not enough people visited the attraction, and Mr. Guillaume owed his creditors over CAD $6 million when Storyeum closed.


== Facts ==
Storyeum was bigger than six NHL regulation size ice rinks, 104,000 square feet (9,700 m2).
Storyeum was one of the biggest tourist attractions built since EXPO 86.
The passenger lifts used in the first and last set were some of the world's biggest.
The passenger lifts were capable of transporting 200 people or 25,000 pounds.
Storyeum's replica locomotive in Set No. 7 was an exact replica of the Canadian Pacific Railway Locomotive#374, the first to pull passenger cars across Canada.
Storyeum initially was a CAD $22 million private investment project and was built in 6 months.


== The show ==
The theatrical adventure predominantly took place under the streets of Gastown. The entire show duration was approximately 65 minutes. Storyeum broke from the traditional performance/play by making guests move from set to set. In total, there were eight sets, including the 360 degree visual demonstrations in the two passenger lifts.
The Storyeum experience started when guests entered the first passenger lift to descend below the grounds of Gastown. Upon descent, they were guided from set to set. The sets are, in order of appearance:

GOING UNDERGROUND — introductory visual presentation into Canada and Vancouver's values and brief overlook into pivotal moments of Canadian history. Moments include Terry Fox run, EXPO 86, Men's and Women's Hockey Team Canada winning Olympic Gold Medals in Salt Lake City, U.S., Vancouver being awarded the rights to host the 2010 Winter Olympics, etc. Brief safety and courtesy guidelines are also presented.
ANCIENT TRAILS — first of the real sets involving British Columbia's story with real actors/actresses, sets and special effects. Guests experience the retelling of the creation of man, from wolf, and woman, from bottom of the sea sediments, through the point of view of the British Columbia Tsleil-Waututh native people in a rainforest-like setting; presumably being British Columbia's coastal temperate forests.
THE BIG HOUSE — Guests here experience the love story of the first descendants of the man and woman created in the second set. Taking place over many years, the story marks the finish of the Great Circle of Life.
NEW ARRIVALS — there are two versions of this set that is alternated between seasons. However, the set story remains to be the same, only the physical point of view is alternated between. One version gives the guest a vantage point of looking at a ship while it is coming into harbour in a first contact type scenario between Europeans and the indigenous people. The second version is from the vantage points of actually being on the ship as it comes into harbour during a similar first contact type scenario. In this set, guests are told of the establishment of the Hudson's Bay Company of Canada. There is also mention of fur trading, introduction of small pox, and long distance relationships between sailors and their loved ones in Europe. During special holidays such as British Columbia's Victoria Day, other issues presented in a satirical yet educational atmosphere include addressing present-day Canadian and American differential sentiments and the use of the 49th parallel to set much of the border between the United States of America and Canada.
GOLD SEEKERS — taking place circa 1862 in Barkerville, British Columbia, covers the Gold Rush of the Pacific North-West particularly its role in British Columbia. Other issues covered include: the Royal Decree to unite and confederate Canada, the Barkerville fire, law and order issues in the remote vastness of British Columbia, and the low female to male ratio.
NATIONAL DREAM — In this set, guests experience the unification of Canada by a national rail line spanning the nation from coast to coast. Other issues presented include the Women's Suffrage in Canada, the role of the Chinese in building the railway, and the Chinese Head Tax.
LAST STOP — This set's story takes place at a railway station. The set is presumably set in Vancouver because of a replica Gastown Steam clock present on set. In this part of the experience, circa 1944, guests see a Canadian soldier, waiting at the station to depart for reconstruction efforts in Italy, with a wife waiting for her husband, who is a Canadian Forces soldier, return from fighting in Europe. As the show progresses, a replica Canadian Pacific Railway locomotive steams into the station with the husband. The set ends with a grand musical performance with underlying feelings of promoting multiculturalism and acceptance. This set marks the end of the experience with real actors/actresses, sets, and special effects.
BC SPIRIT — In this last set, guests enter a passenger lift to return to street level. During the ascent, a visual mosaic of individuality and society cohesiveness is celebrated. The end of the presentation officially marks the end of the Storyeum experience.

108,Woodward's Building,"The Woodward's Building is a historic building in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  The original portion of the building was constructed in 1903 for the Woodward's Department Store when that area of Cordova Street was the heart of Vancouver's retail shopping district.  At one time this was the premiere shopping destination in Vancouver.  The store was famous for its Christmas window displays and its basement Food Floor, and the ""W"" sign at the top of the building was a distinctive landmark on the Vancouver skyline.
Since the bankruptcy of Woodward's in 1993 the building remained vacant except for a housing occupation in 2002 that initiated the redevelopment process.  Redevelopment was seen by many as a key to revitalizing the Downtown Eastside, but the demolition of the structure in 2006 and redevelopment of the site has been met with much local resistance from the existing residents of the neighborhood. The Woodward's redevelopment is now complete with many residents and businesses now in the buildings.


== History ==


=== Early history ===
The building was built in 1903 by Charles A. Woodward as the second location for the Woodward's department store.  Woodward's pioneered the concept of one-stop shopping; the store included a food floor which was at the time North America's largest supermarket, household items, men's and women's fashion, and provided cheque cashing, travel booking and other services. The store was well known for carrying a large variety of goods that were not available anywhere else. The store soon became a feature attraction in Vancouver, and it expanded over 12 separate phases to a final size of 12 storeys. It occupied approximately 2/3 of the city block.  The popularity of Woodward's attracted many other businesses to the area.
The building grew over many years in incremental phases, so the structure varied in each phase of the building.  The majority of the building was supported by concrete slabs and columns with only the original 1903–08 building using massive heavy timber construction from the old growth forests that were available near Vancouver at the turn of the 20th century. Much of the square footage of the building was not retail space; mazes of stockrooms and offices comprised much of the building's space, outside the view of customers.
In 1944, the landmark ""W"" was installed on the top of the building on a 25-metre replica of the Eiffel Tower, replacing a pre-war searchlight-beacon which had until then been the building's hallmark.  The beacon, which was visible at night from as far away as Abbotsford and Mission, was shut down at the beginning of World War II because of its potential use as a landmark for aerial attacks.


=== Decline ===

Woodward's fortunes declined as customers gravitated toward suburban shopping malls during the 1960s. The relocation of the Eaton's department store from West Hastings and Richards (a few blocks away), to the uptown location of Pacific Centre in the 1960s, signaled the demise of West Hastings Street as the central retail district of the city. This was further exasperated by the deindustrialization of the old city centre, which lead to the migration of working class residents out of the area and the loss of an important source of clients. Immediately following deindustrialisation was the expansion of the quaternary sector of the post-industrial economy over at the West End, shifting major economic activities to the new city centre near Burrard and Georgia streets, further reducing Woodward's prominence.
In the 1980s, Woodward's sold the food floor – long known for its quality and its line of unusual specialities – to Safeway. The flagship food floor became an IGA store until the building closed as Safeway showed no interest in that location. During the same time, the area around the Woodward's building started to decline socially and economically.
In 1993, Woodward's went bankrupt and closed its doors. Many of the store's suburban locations were sold to the Hudson's Bay Company for conversion to Zellers and Bay stores, but there was little interest in the historic downtown building. The closing of the Woodward's store precipitated an even more rapid decline in the area.


== Redevelopment ==


=== Early proposals ===
In 1995 the building was acquired by Fama Holdings. The firm by using services of Brook Development Planning, Davidson Yuen Simpson and Foad Rafii Architects developed a plan to build private housing in the building. However, many of those in the neighbourhood strongly objected, as they felt it important that the project incorporate social housing. The provincial government of British Columbia decided to fund some social housing as part of the project, but Fama and the province could not come to an agreement, and the project died. The building stood largely vacant, except for the occasional film shoot. In 2001 the province bought the building from Fama for $22 million. A variety of options were pursued to develop the building, but in early 2002 the new Provincial government put the project on hold.In the fall of 2002 a small group of community activists squatted the empty building for one week in a campaign to secure social housing from the Provincial government. After the police eviction a tent city was erected on the sidewalks around the building for another three months. The series of events is known as the Woodward's Squat, or ""Woodsquat"", which has been acknowledged for ""setting in motion the eventual redevelopment of the landmark department store building"".


=== Community-led redevelopment ===

In 2003, the City of Vancouver, led by City Council member Jim Green, purchased the building from the province for $5 million, and began a public consultation process, asking the community what they wanted from the redevelopment. After a two-stage competition between three developers in September 2004, the city selected Westbank Projects/Peterson Investment Group to develop the project together with architecture firm of Henriquez Partners lead by Gregory Henriquez and structural engineers Glotman Simpson Consulting Engineers. The 400 million dollar, nearly one million square foot project, includes 536 market housing units, 125 singles non-market housing units to be operated by PHS Community Services, 75 family non-market housing units to be operated by Affordable Housing Society, Nesters Market, London Drugs, TD Canada Trust, the National Film Board of Canada and civic offices, a daycare, public atrium and plaza, and a new 130,000 square foot addition to Simon Fraser University's downtown campus, the SFU School for Contemporary Arts.On the morning of 30 September 2006, all but the oldest original portion (1903–08 building) of the Woodward's structure was demolished with a ""roll-over"" implosion by Pacific Blasting which signalled the beginning of the construction of the new complex of buildings.


=== Results ===
The market housing units constructed in the building feature both modern-look finishes and vintage analog thermostats. The oldest part of the complex (built 1903–1908) was restored, and serves as a non-profit office and community space (31,500 sf), with tenants including W2 Community Media Arts. The development permit for construction was issued on January 26, 2007, and while substantial completion was scheduled for June 2010, delays pushed that completion date back to September 2010.The ""W"" neon sign, which topped the building on the Eiffel Tower replica, was removed before the demolition and was replicated and re-installed on January 9, 2010, now boasting energy-saving LED lights. The original W is now displayed in the open area next to The Charles Bar at the new Woodward's Building. In 2008 the Vancouver artist Stan Douglas completed a 30' by 50' image on glass depicting the Gastown Riots of 1971. The over-sized photograph, together with a basketball hoop, has become the central focus within the atrium of the new Woodward's Redevelopment.
The redevelopment of the Woodward's site had the side-effect of displacing some of Vancouver's sex worker population; however, prostitutes remain in the Downtown Eastside area.

109,Little Sister's Book and Art Emporium,"Little Sister's Book and Art Emporium, also known as Little Sister's Bookstore, but usually called ""Little Sister's"", is an independent bookstore in the Davie Village/West End neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, a predominantly gay community. The bookstore was opened in 1983 by Jim Deva and Bruce Smythe, and its current manager is Don Wilson.
The bookstore is famous for being embroiled in a legal battle with the Canada Border Services Agency over the importation of what the agency has labeled ""obscene materials"". These materials, nearly all dealing with male-male or female-female sexuality, were routinely seized at the border.  The same publications, when destined for mainstream booksellers in the country, had often been delivered without delay or question. Glad Day Bookshop, an LGBT bookstore in Toronto, has faced similar difficulties.
... [A]lternative culture and lifestyles, including manuals and handbooks on safe sex (?!) were proclaimed indecent by someone who has no right to judge them in his/her bias/bigotry, which violates the anti-discrimination protection of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms guaranteeing equality of all Canadians. Not to mention that five out of ten provinces (plus one of the two territories) explicitly forbid discrimination based on sexual orientation.
Little Sister's filed their claim against the federal government in 1990, but the case stalled and was not heard until October 1994. The trial concluded in January 1996 with a judgment for the plaintiffs. The court found that Little Sister's shipments had been wrongly delayed or withheld due to the ""systemic targeting of Little Sisters' importations in the Customs Mail Center.""In 2000, the case was heard in the Supreme Court of Canada. The court found that the customs has targeted shipments to the bookstore and attempted to prevent them from getting in. Consequently, the government was found to have violated section 2 of the Charter. However, the violation was justified under section 1. The case established that the onus of proving that expressive material is obscene lies with Canadian Customs.
The bookstore's travails were fictionalized as a subplot of the film Better Than Chocolate. A feature-length documentary film by Aerlyn Weissman, Little Sister's vs. Big Brother (2002), has also been released about the bookstore. Former manager Janine Fuller was also a coauthor with Stuart Blackley of the book Restricted Entry: Censorship on Trial, a non-fiction account of the Little Sister's battle, and wrote an introduction for Forbidden Passages: Writings Banned in Canada, an anthology of excerpts from some of the impounded works which was edited by Patrick Califia. Both books were published in 1995, and were awarded Lammys at the 8th Lambda Literary Awards ceremony in 1996. Additionally, the book What right?: Graphic interpretations against censorship addressed the court case in the form of a graphic novel, with proceed from sales of the book being donated to the Little Sister's Defense fund to assist with legal challenges with Canada Customs. The book features contributions from a number of comic artists including Alison Bechdel and Marc Bell.
The bookstore's co-owner, Jim Deva, died on September 21, 2014 at age 64. On December 23, 2019, Bruce Smyth, co-founder of Little Sister's, died at St. John Hospice at age 66.

111,"West End, Vancouver","The West End is a neighbourhood in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on the Downtown Vancouver peninsula neighbouring Stanley Park and the areas of Yaletown, Coal Harbour and the financial and central business districts.
The definition of the ""official neighbourhood"" of the West End, according to the city, is the area west of Burrard Street, east of Denman Street, and south of West Georgia Street.  Historically the term originated and remains used by Vancouverites to refer to everything from Burrard Street to Stanley Park, including the Stanley Park Neighbourhood west of Denman Street and the Coal Harbour Neighbourhood. Coal Harbour Neighbourhood is officially designated as west of Burrard and to the north of West Georgia, although the newly built areas between West Pender Street and the waterfront are expressly ""Coal Harbour"" and not considered part of the West End.


== History ==
Like all of Vancouver, the West End was originally a forested wilderness. The area was purchased in 1862 by John Morton, Samuel Brighouse, and William Hailstone, three men known as the ""Three Greenhorn Englishmen,"" or just the ""Three Greenhorns,"" owing to the belief that the naive men paid too much for the remote land. The men had plans to establish a brickworks on the shore of Coal Harbour, and their land claim was originally staked with the hopeful intent of mining for porcelain clays, but the grade of clay was not fine enough for that use. When those plans failed (a lack of transportation being a key factor) they sold a good portion of the area, by then known as the Brickmaker's Claim, to Victoria investors who in turn tried to promote its development as New Liverpool. The only thing that happened with that scheme was a subdivision plan registered with the Land Titles office in New Westminster. Another name used for the property was the Brighouse Estate (Brighouse as a name came to refer to a particular part of Richmond, where ""Greenhorn"" J. Morton also owned property). One of the partners, observant that brick was a valuable building commodity despite the abundance of timber in the region, moved the brick-clay operations to Sumas Mountain, establishing the community of Clayburn, now a neighbourhood of Abbotsford.

Later, with the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway, with its terminus at nearby Coal Harbour, the West End became Vancouver's first upscale neighbourhood, home to the richest railroad families. Many of these families lived along Georgia Street, known at that time as ""Blue Blood Alley"" for all the posh mansions built there. Later mansions (including the Davie mansion) were built in then remoter areas of the West End as the financial district's land values displaced the high-toned residences. This role was ultimately dropped with the increasing vogue for the upscale Shaughnessy neighbourhood, and as middle-class housing of various kinds began to fill out the West End. As the city grew, the West End became a transitory place for new arrivals from elsewhere in Canada, the United Kingdom, and later for immigrants from other countries, establishing a tradition of diversity. Following World War II, a significant German commercial community emerged along Robson Street, giving birth to the nickname Robsonstrasse, a name still occasionally used in marketing despite the loss of its original meaning.


== Demographics ==

The West End is bordered by downtown on the one side, Stanley Park on the other and by water on two. The West End is home to a mixed population, old and young, of Canadians, immigrants and international transient residents.  Like other downtown neighbourhoods, the West End is very densely populated. It is adjacent to the downtown core business and financial districts, with traffic calmed streets punctuated by concrete islands, sidewalk barricades, and mini-parks and many residential heritage buildings including The Manhattan, The Beaconsfield, The Beverly and The Queen Charlotte.
Close to 45,000 people of all ages, incomes, ethnicities, and sexual orientations live in the West End. The age group of 20–39 years consistently ranks the largest at 48%, followed by 40-64 at 34%, 65+ at 13% and under 19 at 6%. Containing 7.4% of the City's population, the West End welcomed 14% of new Vancouverites between 2001 and 2006. The West End is also home to Western Canada's largest LGBTQ community. Vancouver's gay village, called Davie Village, is centred primarily on Davie Street between Burrard and Bute.The share of single-parent families in the West End is about 12%, compared to 17% for the City of Vancouver. Statistics also show that the West End is home to many children — the downtown peninsula now has more children than traditional family neighbourhoods such as West Point Grey or Kerrisdale. Lord Roberts Annex offers kindergarten to grade 3. The student population of Lord Roberts Elementary School (k-grade 7) represents 43 countries and 37 languages. King George Secondary School (grades 8-12) celebrated 100 years in 2014.


== Social issues ==
West End residents have been very active in shaping their neighbourhood and maintaining its liveability. In the 1970s, residents banded together to calm traffic that was using the neighbourhood as a shortcut between downtown Vancouver and the suburbs of the North Shore, across the Lions' Gate Bridge. They also staged a successful ""Shame the Johns"" campaign to rid the West End of the prostitution that was then prevalent in the neighbourhood. This campaign was aided by a 1984 injunction granted by then-B.C. Supreme Court Justice Allan McEachern which banned prostitutes from working west of Granville Street. This forced prostitutes away from the relative safety of Davie Street into Yaletown, then a warehouse district, and eventually into the Downtown Eastside, where already vulnerable prostitutes were even more open to violence and abuse. Today, groups such as the West End Citizens Action Network, the West End Residents Association and West End Neighbours  continue to be actively involved in keeping the West End liveable, albeit from different political perspectives.


== Amenities ==
The West End is particularly famous among visitors for Robson Street. It was historically known as the Robsonstrasse, for the postwar period when it was a hub for immigrants from Germany, and was home to owner operated boutiques, schnitzel houses and other bistro-style dining establishments until the 1980s when the transition to the current fashionable shopping and dining area stretching from Burrard Street to Jervis Street, began. Many restaurants and shops can also be found along Denman Street closer to Stanley Park, and Davie Street between Burrard and Jervis streets.
Numerous parks and beaches can be found throughout the West End including Alexandra Park, Cardero Park, Nelson Park, Stanley Park and Sunset Beach. These parks range in size from 0.22 hectares (Morton Park) to over 406 hectare (Stanley Park). A portion of the Stanley Park Seawall promenade runs along the waterfront from Burrard Bridge to Ceperly Park.
The area is also known for English Bay Beach, a large park on English Bay which is thronged during the annual Celebration of Light fireworks display each year mid-summer. St. Paul's Hospital, one of Vancouver's largest and oldest health facilities, sits at the neighbourhood's eastern edge on Burrard Street.
Community Centres in the West End include the Vancouver Aquatic Centre, West End Community Centre, Coal Harbour Community Centre and Barclay Manor. Depending on the centre, they offer swimming pools, gyms, fitness centres and an ice rink, as well as many meeting and all-purpose rooms for rent.
The West End is not to be confused with the West Side (which denotes the western half of the non-downtown part of Vancouver city to the south) or West Vancouver (""West Van""), a separate municipality. (Conversely, and to the confusion of some, ""East Van,"" ""the East End,"" and ""the East Side"" all denote East Vancouver.)


== Accolade ==
On November 4, 2015, The Canadian Institute of Planners announced winners of its fifth annual Great Places in Canada contest. A jury of seven professional planners named the West End as the Great Neighbourhood. Juror Jaspal Marwah MCIP, RPP stated that ""the West End makes it easy, safe and inviting for residents to walk and bike to work, to access thriving local businesses and to explore Vancouver's beaches, trails and Stanley Park. Transit access, traffic calming, street furniture, treed promenades, pocket parks and public spaces reflect a thoughtful approach to place-making. Home to the city's LGBTQ community, the West End's density is evenly matched by its diversity of residents, and by a strong commitment to creating an inclusive community that prioritizes affordable housing.""

113,Rogers Arena,"Rogers Arena is a multi-purpose arena located at 800 Griffiths Way in the downtown area of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Opened in 1995, the arena was known as General Motors Place (GM Place) from its opening until July 6, 2010, when General Motors Canada ended its naming rights sponsorship and a new agreement for those rights was reached with Rogers Communications. Rogers Arena was built to replace the Pacific Coliseum as Vancouver's primary indoor sports facility and in part due to the National Basketball Association (NBA) 1995 expansion into Canada, when Vancouver and Toronto were given expansion teams.
It is home to the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League and the Vancouver Warriors of the National Lacrosse League. The arena also hosted the ice hockey events at the 2010 Winter Olympics. The name of the arena temporarily became Canada Hockey Place during the Olympics. It was previously home to the Vancouver Grizzlies of the NBA from 1995 to 2001. The Grizzlies spent six seasons in Vancouver before relocating to Memphis, Tennessee, for the 2001–02 season.


== History ==


=== GM Place ===
The arena was completed in 1995 at a cost of C$160 million in private financing to replace the aging Pacific Coliseum as the main venue for events in Vancouver and to serve as the home arena to the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League and the Vancouver Grizzlies of the National Basketball Association. It was originally named General Motors Place as part of a sponsorship arrangement with General Motors Canada, and was commonly known as ""GM Place"" or ""The Garage"". The arena was also briefly home to the Vancouver Ravens of the National Lacrosse League from 2002 to 2004. The operations of the team have since been suspended although attempts were made to revive the team in 2007 and again in 2008.
The employees of the arena belong to a trade union. In 2007, they chose to change their union affiliation from UNITE HERE – Local 40 to the Christian Labour Association of Canada. After many months of struggle the British Columbia Labour Relations Board declared the employees choice of a new union. The employee group includes hosts, housekeeping, security and various event staff at the venue. UNITE-HERE local 40 still represented food service workers in the arena, employed by Aramark. Another union protest began in 2009 when GM Place concession workers, cooks and event staff protested their payment.The arena's event technical employees are provided through Riggit Services Inc. In the same year, the arena also received a new suspended scoreboard, which at the time was the largest in the NHL.  It was temporarily renamed ""Canada Hockey Place"" for a two-week period during the 2010 Winter Olympics due to Olympics regulations regarding corporate sponsorship of event sites.


=== Rogers Arena ===
On July 6, 2010, it was announced that GM had declined to renew the naming rights, and that Rogers Communications had acquired the naming rights under a 10-year deal, under which it was renamed Rogers Arena. The following year, the arena reached a five-year sponsorship deal with PepsiCo, under which it became the exclusive provider of beverages and snacks at Rogers Arena, and gained sponsorship placements. In addition, all concerts held at Rogers Arena promote the venue as Pepsi Live at Rogers Arena.
In July 2012, Aquilini Investment Group had originally planned to build the towers with condo units. The switch to rental units provides the City with much-needed rental space. However, the city lost about $35 million in developer contributions to community facilities in the Northeast False Creek area that would have been collected if the buildings had been condos. As of June 2016, the first tower is completed, with the second tower nearing completion.

114,Whitecaps Waterfront Stadium,"The Whitecaps Waterfront Stadium was a proposed open-air soccer facility in Vancouver, British Columbia that would have been privately funded and developed by the Vancouver Whitecaps FC. The proposed location was north of Gastown on the central waterfront on what was then a parking lot and the site of a helicopter landing pad. The proposed stadium would have housed the Vancouver Whitecaps FC men and women's clubs.


== Proposal ==
The $70-million stadium would have had an initial capacity of 20,000, which would be potentially expandable to 30,000 seats.In addition to Vancouver Whitecaps FC matches, the stadium was intended host international soccer matches, rugby union matches and tournaments, tennis and beach volleyball tournaments, and open-air musical events and concerts such as the Vancouver International Jazz Festival and the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. The stadium would have had  close access to many modes of public transportation, including SkyTrain, SeaBus, West Coast Express, and buses.


== Controversy ==
Although Vancouver public support for the stadium was high (a Mustel survey found that 71% of Vancouver residents supported the project), the proposal drew protests from several groups including the Gastown Neighbourhood Coalition. Local architects Arthur Erickson and Bing Thom also urged caution, saying that piecemeal development of some of Vancouver's last undeveloped waterfront should be avoided. They argued that the stadium would deny waterfront access and would negatively affect the historical theme of the Gastown area. The architects urged city hall to delay approval until a comprehensive plan had been submitted. Independent architecture firm Hotson Bakker, which was hired by the city of Vancouver, concluded that the stadium plans  as proposed were unworkable. They reported that the development did not fit with the Gastown district and did not take future residential developments into account. They also stressed the need for a comprehensive waterfront plan.


== History ==
On July 11, 2006, Vancouver's city council gave unanimous approval to continue the planning process, provided that certain critical problems were addressed. Specific issues included the lack of roads for spectator and emergency access, and the stadium's location above railroad tracks. The project would be reviewed quarterly by city planners until the stadium's construction is approved; the developers had two years to accomplish this.
On January 22, 2007, the Whitecaps filed a new proposal shifting the proposed site for the stadium project to the current location of the SeaBus terminal, a short distance northwest of the previous site.On February 1, 2007, Vancouver City Council unanimously endorsed a city staff report which identified a process to potentially resolve the proposed Whitecaps Waterfront Stadium's five key requirements set out by City Council. In addition, the staff report outlined a procedure to integrate the stadium with the Waterfront Hub Study.In July 2007, the City of Vancouver noted that ""The Whitecaps and the VPA are now considering an alternative siting which addresses the technical constraints facing the SeaBus terminal site. This would involve some of the VPA-owned land between the SeaBus terminal and Crab Park (see figure below) and would enable the SeaBus to remain in place. This area is anticipated for mixed use development by the Central Waterfront Port Lands Policy Statement (1994) and any proposal would need to be considered in that context."" They further added ""The Whitecaps and VPA are currently investigating whether this site could meet their needs and aspirations. If the Whitecaps and VPA decide to pursue the development of the stadium in this location, they will need to develop a proposal and submit it to City staff for evaluation and consultation with the public and interested parties.""Initial plans were targeting completion for Summer 2009, though this has been pushed back many times. On March 18, 2009 Major League Soccer (MLS) announced an expansion franchise to the city to begin play in 2011. The team stated intentions to play at least the first season, and possibly up to five seasons, at BC Place Stadium.In 2011, Bob Lenarduzzi confirmed that the team was committed to BC Place, and that plans for the Waterfront Stadium were put on hold.

115,Vancouver House,"Vancouver House is a neo-futurist residential skyscraper in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.


== Overview ==
Construction of the skyscraper began in 2016 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2019, though it is postponed to Summer of 2020.


== Design ==
Vancouver House was designed by Danish architect Bjarke Ingels. The design is based on a triangle that rises from the ground and gradually transitions into a rectangle as it ascends to the top. The design reflects the constraints of developing the triangular-shaped plot of land immediately east of the Howe Street on-ramp of the Granville Street Bridge. The east and west facades of the building feature box-shaped balconies, giving the building's exterior a honeycomb texture.

116,Plaza of Nations,"The Plaza of Nations was an entertainment complex located on the northeast shore of False Creek in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
It was part of the British Columbia Pavilion during Expo '86, and along with Science World, Canada Place, and the Roundhouse Community Centre, it had been one of the remaining physical reminders of the Expo. The sheltered plaza had a capacity of 4,500 for performances. The Plaza had been nominated by the city's Heritage Commission to be added to the Vancouver Heritage Register. Along with the Roundhouse and Science World, Plaza of Nations was considered important for demarcating the spatial extent of the world's fair, which was a transformative event for the city in its centennial year. It was decided in 2007 that the building was to be demolished completely, leaving the Edgewater Casino the only remaining structure, although it may be rebuilt or redesigned.
Plaza of Nations consisted of Enterprise Hall, the West Building, the East Building, and the Covered Plaza. It has been owned by Canadian Metropolitan Properties since 1990. The site housed Edgewater Casino, until its relocation to Parq Vancouver in September 2017, and hosted various cultural and entertainment events, including the Dragon Boat Festival, and has been a popular events venue for various ethnic communities in Vancouver, as well as for corporate events.
Plaza of Nations was the only outdoor sheltered plaza in Vancouver, as well as the city's only cultural venue on the waterfront. It was also an important mid-size venue for popular music acts seeing artists such as Foo Fighters, Hootie & the Blowfish, Fugazi, My Morning Jacket and Garbage, among others perform sold out concerts at the venue. 
The Plaza was used for a filming location for numerous projects, such as the Stargate SG-1 episode ""2010"", several episodes of The Outer Limits and Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century and it served as the stadium precinct in Continuum.
Planned as a temporary structure to be torn down after Expo '86, the glass roof of the plaza was found to be unsafe by city officials in November 2006, with notices to that effect being posted in the offices of the ownership on Wednesday, November 22 and subsequently the area under the canopy was fenced off for public safety. The sudden closure forced the events planned for the space to move with little or no notice (see Portobello West). In January 2007, the ownership decided that the cost of repairing the roof was too high, and opted to demolish both the roof and its two adjoining office buildings. As of November 2007, demolition of the roof has been completed and all tenants of the adjoining structures have vacated. Plans for use of the space have not been released, however the owners and the City of Vancouver are planning continued use of the plaza as a covered outdoor performance venue. As of March 2008, the west building office structure is completely demolished. The future of the site remains unclear as the east office complex has not been abandoned and the plaza concert amphitheater was rebuilt and restored with the original seating and new flooring.
Oei Hong Leong bought the Plaza of Nations site from Li Ka-shing in 1989 for CAN$40 million. The site has been renamed Expo Gardens and there are plans to build 1.4 million sq ft of residential property and 700,000 sq ft of commercial and retail property.

117,North Star Hotel,"The North Star hotel is a former hotel at the southern edge of Gastown in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Located at 5 West Hastings Street, it is a four-story red brick Victorian Italianate construction completed at an unidentified date, between the 1890s and 1904.


== Architecture ==
The building was constructed as mixed use, with the main floor including storefront space. Details making it typical of late Victorian architecture include its four arched, vertically-coupled recessed double-hung windows; its rusticated stone stringcourse and sills; its front elevation with decorative brickwork, including stepped brick dentil below cornice level, semi-circular arches over fourth-storey double-hung sash windows, and moulded brickwork under rusticated stone string course. It may have been designed by George William Grant, whose nearby Ormidale Block bears some similar features. In 2003, the city of Vancouver recognized the building as one of historical significance.


== History ==
Like others built around the turn of the century, the lodging house originally hosted primarily single men working in seasonal resource industries. In 1913, it was called ""Drexel Rooms"", a name it kept until the 1980s, then later renamed the North Star Hotel or North Star Rooms, a single room occupancy hotel. It is closed in 1999 after repeated code violations.


=== 2006 squat ===
At approximately 4 p.m. on October 22, 2006, organizers from the Vancouver Anti-Poverty Committee launched a march from Vancouver's Pigeon Park to the North Star hotel which was entered and declared a squat. The top floor of the building is being occupied by a handful of squatters while protestors remain outside.
Protestors claimed the action was taken because of the failure of Vancouver's Non-Partisan Association (including Mayor Sam Sullivan) to purchase unused hotels and convert them into affordable housing. Since Vancouver housing costs had increased dramatically in the past years (making it the most expensive housing market in Canada), protestors were concerned that buildings with single-room accommodation would be converted to other, more expensive, forms of housing. In 2006, hotel closures have led to a loss of as many as 200 housing units.At first the police resisted any immediate action. ""We're not going to move in until there's any sort of health and safety issue or until we've heard from the owners,"" said Vancouver Police Constable Tim Fanning. ""It's been very peaceful."" On October 24, however, 20 police officers announced a final warning and entered the North Star hotel to evict the six squatters inside. A group of protesters followed the police wagon on foot, protesting and blocking traffic. Vancouver APC organizers have declared their intention to occupy another building in the near future.The Vancouver Anti-Poverty Committee also organized the 2002 squatting of Vancouver's Woodward's building.


=== Renovation ===
In 2014, in what was described as a ""highly unusual"" application, the Solterra Group applied for permission to renovate the building with half the rooms reserved for low-income residents. In the proposal, five of the rooms were to be rented at the provincial shelter rate, and another 13 rooms at the provincial rent supplement rate, locked in for 30 years. In 2015, city hall voted to give the developer $50,000 to restore the building's facade, though as of 2016, the plans had not received all necessary permits.

118,Centre A,"Centre A (Vancouver International Centre for Contemporary Asian Art) is a non-profit art gallery in Vancouver committed to the research, production, presentation and interpretation of contemporary Asian art. It is the only public gallery in Canada dedicated to contemporary Asian visual art practices. Founded in 1999 by Hank Bull (Founding Director), Zheng Shengtian and Stephanie Holmquist, the centre has been led by a board of directors with respected members of the community consisting Milton Wong, Joanne Louie Mah, Joe Wai and Anndraya Luui. Over the years, a number of curators and directors contributed to the success of the gallery, including Sadira Rodrigues, Alice Ming Wai Jim, Makiko Hara, Haema Sivanesan and Tyler Russell.
Centre A was originally located at 849 Homer Street, near the Vancouver Public Library's central branch. It then moved to 2 West Hastings Street, in the Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. During this time Makiko Hara was Curator. In 2013, under the direction of Haema Sivanesan, Centre A relocated to Chinatown at 229 East Georgia Street. Over the years, the centre has exhibited a number of notable Canadian and international contemporary artists, such as Yoko Ono, Lida Abdul, Abbas Akhavan, Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries, Hajira Waheed, Ali Kazimi, Lani Maestro, Kyohei Sakaguchi, Jim Wong-Chu and Samson Young. Most recently, Centre A moved to their current 3,300 square foot location at the Sun Wah Centre at 268 Keefer Street for the next foreseeable future with Henry Heng Lu as the new Curator.


== Reading Room and Library ==
The Reading Room and Library at Centre A began in 1999 with contributions from artists, researchers, and curators both locally in Vancouver and internationally. Previous curators at Centre A ""have made significant contributions in collecting publications that reflect and engage in conversations concerning contemporary Asian and Asian diasporic art practices, and the artistic relationships between North America and Asia."" Centre A's Reading Room also houses the Fraser Finlayson Collection of rare books on Classical Chinese and Japanese Art with publications dating back to the late 19th century.

121,Sam Kee Building,"The Sam Kee Building, located at 8 West Pender Street in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, is the ""narrowest commercial building in the world"" according to the Guinness Book of Records.

The Sam Kee Company—originally owned by one of the wealthiest businessmen in Vancouver Chinatown. Mr. Chang Toy purchased the standard-sized lot in 1903. In 1912, however, Vancouver widened Pender Street and expropriated 24 feet (7.3 m) of the above-ground portion of the property—effectively (or so it was first believed) making conventional commercial use of the remaining frontage impractical, if not impossible. After refusing the neighbour's offer to buy the remaining land, someone bet Chang Toy that he couldn’t use the land for anything. Deciding to prove everyone wrong, he decided to build anyway. In 1913, the architects Brown and Gillam designed this narrow, steel-framed building's ground-floor depth (from storefront to rear of building) to measure 4'11"" (1.50 m), with a second-floor depth (from overhanging bay window to rear) of 6' (1.83 m). The basement extends beneath the sidewalk and originally housed public baths, while the ground floor was used for offices and shops and the top story for living quarters.Historical renovation of the building was designed by Soren Rasmussen and was completed in 1986.  It is a tourist attraction and an insurance office.
The building is considered the narrowest commercial building in the world according to the Guinness Book of Records and was formerly also viewed as such by Ripley's Believe it or Not!, but in recent years this status has been challenged by the ""Skinny Building"" in Pittsburgh. The dispute centres around the fact that while the Sam Kee Building's width varies from floor to floor, and is 6 feet wide in places, Pittsburgh's ""Skinny Building"" is 5'2"" (1.57 m) wide on all floors.

== History ==
On June 16, 2020, the statue was splattered with red paint amidst growing calls to remove statues honoring colonialist or racist individuals. Activists cited Deighton's marriage to a 12 year old Squamish girl named Quahail-ya as the reason for its removal. A petition calling for its removal garnered over 1,500 signatures.

123,Gastown riots,"The Gastown riot, known also in the plural as Gastown riots, also known as ""The Battle of Maple Tree Square"", occurred in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on August 7, 1971. Following weeks of arrests by undercover drug squad members in Vancouver as part of a special police operation directed by Mayor Tom Campbell, police attacked a peaceful protest smoke-in in the Gastown neighbourhood. The smoke-in, organized by the Youth International Party (Vancouver Yippies) against the use of undercover agents and in favour of the legalization of marijuana. Of around two thousand protesters, 79 were arrested and 38 were charged.Police were accused of heavy-handed tactics including indiscriminate beatings with their newly issued riot batons. They also used horse-back charges on crowds of onlookers and tourists.A commission of inquiry into the incident was headed by Supreme Court Justice Thomas Dohm. The Inquiry cited the Yippies as instigators of the Smoke-In, calling  them ""intelligent and dangerous individuals,"" but was  highly critical of the police's conduct and described the incident as a police riot.The Gastown riots are commemorated in a two-story-high 2009 photo mural called Abbott & Cordova, August 7, 1971 by local artist Stan Douglas, installed in the atrium of the redeveloped Woodward's Complex.

124,Georgia Viaduct,"The Georgia Viaduct is a twinned bridge that acts as a flyover-like overpass in Vancouver, British Columbia. It passes between Rogers Arena and BC Place Stadium and connects Downtown Vancouver with Main Street and Strathcona.


== History ==
The first Georgia Street Viaduct was built between 1913 and 1915. The narrow structure included streetcar tracks that were never used. At one point, every second lamppost was removed to reduce weight. It was replaced in 1972 by the current viaduct, which is structurally separated.
The current Georgia Viaduct was envisioned in the early 1970s as forming part of an extensive freeway system for Vancouver. However, communities were opposed to the idea of demolishing structures to build the freeway system and the plan was scrapped. The freeways would have required demolishing buildings in neighborhoods including Strathcona, the Downtown Eastside and Chinatown. A predominantly Black Canadian community called Hogan's Alley was bulldozed in building the viaduct.
The viaduct opened on January 9, 1972, amid protests who attempted to block mayor Tom Campbell's limousine from reaching the western end.


== Traffic flow ==

The viaduct's eastbound traffic is fed from Georgia Street and leads vehicles to Prior Street and Main Street. The viaduct's westbound lanes—often referred to as Dunsmuir Viaduct because they connect to Dunsmuir Street—pass to the north of Rogers Arena. The westbound traffic comes from Prior Street and Main Street, and carries vehicles and pedestrians to Dunsmuir Street, downtown which feeds into Melville Street and eventually Pender Street.


== Deadpool filming ==
On April 5, 2015, the viaduct was closed for two weeks to allow filming of the movie Deadpool, which was released on February 12, 2016.


== Demolition ==
On October 27, 2015, Vancouver City Council voted to demolish the twin viaducts. A new six-lane road configuration that merges Expo and Pacific boulevards is in the planning stages.

125,Coal Harbour,"Coal Harbour is the name for a section of Burrard Inlet lying between Vancouver, Canada's downtown peninsula and the Brockton Peninsula of Stanley Park.  It has also now become the name of the neighbourhood adjacent to its southern shoreline.


== Neighbourhood ==
Coal Harbour is used to designate the relatively new official neighbourhood of the City of Vancouver bounded by roughly Burrard Street and Pender near the Financial District to West Georgia Street near the West End in the south to Stanley Park in the north. The neighbourhood consists of numerous high-rise residential apartment and condo towers with luxury townhome podiums catering to the upper-crust.


=== Features ===
The northwestern section near Stanley Park features picturesque parkland, private marinas, several rowing and boating clubs, high-end shoppes and restaurants, and a community centre designed by architect Gregory Henriquez.  To the east is Deadman's Island, the site of the naval station and museum HMCS Discovery, where the harbour itself opens up to the Burrard Inlet. Towards the Financial District in the southeast, the neighbourhood is dominated by high-rise office buildings, hotels and numerous apartment towers. Immediately south lies Vancouver's Luxury Zone along Alberni Street.
Coal Harbour is home to Vancouver Harbour Water Aerodrome, located a few blocks from Canada Place and the Vancouver Convention Centre. Within the harbour is a floating gas station for marine vessels.
The six floating homes in Coal Harbour, along with the twelve across town in False Creek are the only legal floating homes within the city of Vancouver.


== History ==
The discovery of coal in the harbor in 1862 inspired the name. In the days when the area along West Pender Street was an upper-class residential district, Coal Harbour was known as Blueblood Alley because of the many large mansions along it.
Notable inhabitants and developments in Coal Harbour's past include:

Squamish settlements, notably on Deadman Island, Brockton Point and Lumberman's Arch.
In 1862 minor exploration began of the visible coal seams on the flank of the bluff overlooking the harbour, first noted by Captain Vancouver.  This bluff was approximately where most of West Hastings Street is today.  The coal was low-grade, but its occurrence in clays similar to porcelain-making clays of the English Midlands led to the staking of what is known as the Brickmaker's Claim by the Three Greenhorns.  The Brickmaker's Claim is now the West End.  No clay was ever mined nor porcelain ever made, but one of the Greenhorns was the developer of the clay mine and brickworks at Clayburn on Sumas Mountain near Abbotsford.
A settlement of Kanakas (Hawaiians) near today's Bayshore Inn and the eastern end of Lost Lagoon was known as the Kanaka Rancherie, or the Cherry Orchard due to its many cherry trees. The area is now called Devonian Harbour Park, and memorial cherry trees have been planted there in memory of AIDS victims.
The Vancouver Boating Club, now Vancouver Rowing Club, from 1887 (originally at the bottom of the bluff at the foot of Howe Street)
The Pacific Lumber Mill Company in the late 19th century
The Royal Vancouver Yacht Club (their first clubhouse floated in Coal Harbour at the foot of Cardero street in 1903)
Denman Arena was built in 1911 to house the Vancouver Millionaires professional ice hockey club on the Kanakas Ranch site at Georgia and Denman. The Arena would host the only victory by a Vancouver team of the Stanley Cup in 1915. The Denman Auditorium was built adjacent to the Arena in 1927 for concerts and smaller events. The Arena was destroyed by fire in 1936. The Auditorium remained in use until its demolition in 1959.
Boeing Canada's Seaplane and Boat Factory beginning in the 1910s; (they purchased the Hoffar-Beeching Shipyard at 1927 West Georgia in 1929)
William Boeing's yacht, the superb Taconite, was built at Hoffars in 1931.
The Vancouver Shipyards through the 1930s
The CP Rail Station & Canadian Pacific Steamships passenger terminal/dock
The Royal Canadian Air Force began work on a seaplane base and reconnaissance station at Coal Harbour in 1940. As part of the war effort, the RCAF turned over its direction finding and intercept facility to the Royal Canadian Navy. Due to an organizational change in 1942, the RCN ratings stationed at Coal Harbour and the ones from Ucluelet were withdrawn and moved to Gordon Head near Victoria.
Harbour Ferries, a tour-boat and water-taxi service, continues to operate from docks in Coal Harbour
Howard Hughes, who resided in the top two floors of the Bayshore Inn (Westin Bayshore) for 5 months and 28 days in the 1970s (6 months would have triggered Canadian residency and taxation issues for Mr. Hughes).
Denman Arena, an indoor ice arena that stood from 1911 to 1936.
Trader Vic's, for many years held to be Vancouver's best night-out, was launched in a tiki-style hut next to the Bayshore.
HMCS Discovery, a naval base on Deadman Island.
In 1993 Vancouver City Council froze applications for development of the Marathon Realty lands between Canada Place and the Bayshore Hotel. The company was required to reach an agreement with The First Narrows Floating Co-op, representing floating home and live-aboard boat residents in pre existing marinas, for their inclusion in the redevelopment of the waterfront. Negotiations concluded with the guarantee of space for residents in Coal Harbour Marina on extended leases.

126,Hotel Europe (Vancouver),"Hotel Europe is a six-story heritage building located at 43 Powell Street (at Alexander) in the Gastown area of Vancouver, British Columbia. The building was commissioned by hotelier Angelo Calori and built in 1908-1909 by Parr and Fee Architects. Situated on a triangular lot, the building is designed in the flatiron style. It was the first reinforced concrete structure to be built in Canada and the earliest fireproof hotel in Western Canada. Contractors had to be brought in from Cincinnati, Ohio for the necessary expertise; the Ferro-Concrete Construction Company began this project six years after constructing the first tall concrete building in the world.
With funding from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the building was renovated in 1983 as affordable housing with A. Ingre and Associates as the project designers. The residential units are now managed by the Affordable Housing Society. A beer parlour formerly existed below the ground floor, which included areaways extending underneath the above sidewalks. To prevent a cave-in from the weight of pedestrians and above ground traffic, the City of Vancouver filled the areaway in with pea gravel at a cost of $215,000, which presumably can be easily removed in the event of future restoration.The Hotel Europe was one of the filming locations for the suspense movie The Changeling. In it, the building houses the Seattle Historical Society, but the hotel sign can be seen on the right side facade of the building in some takes. Some scenes are set on its roof terrace. Hotel Europe was also a filming location in the 1994 epic drama film Legends of the Fall.It is also one of the locations for the music video Likey from the Korean female group twice.

127,2001 Molson Indy Vancouver,"The 2001 Molson Indy Vancouver was a Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) motor race held on September 2, 2001 at Concord Pacific Place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was the 15th round of the 2001 CART season. Roberto Moreno won the shortened race by five seconds over Gil de Ferran and Michael Andretti.
Moreno won his second and final CART race by passing multiple contenders throughout the race, also earning Patrick Racing its final victory in open-wheel racing in the process. de Ferran earned his fifth podium of 2001 and moved into first place in the points standings, but he still did not have a win for Team Penske at this point in the season. Andretti picked up his fourth podium of the year and his sixth overall at Vancouver.
The race was marked by multiple incidents and crashes that forced CART officials to call a timed race that ended the event after two hours and 98 of the scheduled 100 laps. Despite starting on pole and leading the most laps, Alex Tagliani was forced to retire from the lead after 68 laps when his Ford-Cosworth engine let go in dramatic fashion, once again thwarting his attempts to take his first victory in the series.


== Report ==


=== Background ===
Vancouver was the second Canadian stop for the CART teams after Toronto, and the series had seen massive swings in form from both drivers and teams. Rookie Bruno Junqueira, who had previously been scrapping for points in the midfield, scored his first win at the preceding race in Road America. After winning the race in Toronto, Michael Andretti had been plagued with multiple DNFs before finally finishing second at Road America and was looking to get his pursuit of the championship back on track. Defending series champion Gil de Ferran, after a lukewarm start to 2001, was beginning to power his way to the front of the point standings, coming to Vancouver on the heels of three consecutive top-5 finishes and a pole position at Mid-Ohio. His teammate, Helio Castroneves, was currently leading the standings by a slim margin over Kenny Bräck.
But the big story going into Vancouver was the rise of Forsythe Racing and the string of good results by Canadian drivers Patrick Carpentier and Alex Tagliani. After struggling for points at the beginning of the year, their luck began to change after Tagliani scored his first career podium in front of the home fans in Toronto, followed by Carpentier scoring his first win at the next race at Michigan. From then on, both drivers had scored solid points in every race before Vancouver, including two more podiums for Carpentier. Analysts expected both Forsythe Racing drivers to continue their momentum now that they were back on Canadian soil.Also going into the weekend, CART announced a three-year extension for the Vancouver race, meaning that the 2002 season would see three Canadian races, after it was confirmed that Montreal would host the series at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.


=== Practice and Qualifying ===
Practice would be a challenge for the teams and the drivers, as the weather forecasts called for light showers on Friday and again during qualifying on Saturday. For morning practice on Friday, however, the inclement weather stayed away long enough for the full session to be completed. Many driver experienced grip issues on the slick temporary street course, especially at the 90-degree right-handed Turn 1. Dario Franchitti stalled twice on track during the first session with fuel pressure issues while Max Wilson nudged into the Turn 12 barriers, causing moderate damage to the nose of the car. At the end of the session, Tony Kanaan had managed to top the time sheets with a 1:01.958 followed by Cristiano da Matta with a 1:01.968 and de Ferran with a 1:02.302. The top twelve cars were separated by less than one second.
Although clouds were building around Vancouver during the Friday afternoon practice, no rain fell on the track and thus the session continued as normal. The pace began to pick up as drivers started putting in more and more fast laps. The only major interruption of the day came when Junqueira hit the wall in Turn 10 and damaged the right suspension about twenty minutes into the session, bringing out the red flag. The quickest laps came right at the end, with Tagliani clocking a 1:01.230 on his final lap of the day, followed by Castroneves at 1:01.438 and Roberto Moreno at 1:01.506. Bräck, Franchitti, Wilson, Bryan Herta, and Alex Zanardi all moved to their backup cars during the session.

I'd like to race in Canada all the time. The media isn't easy, but I get more motivation and more support from the fans... I got lucky on my last lap and had no traffic so I was able to put in a perfect lap. But being fastest on one day doesn't mean you're going to win the weekend. We'll have to push harder tomorrow.
The rain that was predicted for the weekend finally fell later that night and soaked the track, and the result going into qualifying day was a track with standing water from Turn 8 to Turn 12 and dry patches of asphalt everywhere else. Drivers approached the track with rain tires at the start of Saturday morning practice, but as the session went on drivers began to put on slicks as the track dried out. Castroneves set the fastest time of the weekend with a 1:00.742, the first driver to break out of the 1:01 second range. de Ferran followed up in second with a 1:01.235 and da Matta came in third with a 1:01.503.When qualifying began later that day, the track had completely dried out as the field was split into two groups for the afternoon session. Junqueira topped Group 1 with a 1:01.194, followed by Max Papis with a 1:01.668 and Adrian Fernández with a 1:01.711.Group 2 saw many drivers testing the track limits, or in some cases, exceeding them. da Matta, just two minutes after the beginning of the session, slid into the barriers at Turn 12, damaging his front wing and forcing him to use the backup car for the rest of the session. Ten minutes later, Moreno, who at the time was running third in the session and fourth overall, lost power on the backstretch and was forced to retire the car. Tagliani, meanwhile, had put his car on provisional pole with a 1:00.872. Little changed at the top of lap charts until minutes before the end of the session when Carpentier put in a blistering lap and qualified second overall with a 1:00.924. Immediately afterward, however, he slid into the barrier at Turn 6 and stalled the car. Compatriot Paul Tracy, just ahead of him, crashed into the barriers at Turn 7 and damaged the front suspension. CART officials threw the red-and-checkered flag, ending the session.Qualifying had produced an all-Canadian front row, much to the delight of the Vancouver race fans and Forsythe Racing. This was Tagliani's second pole position in his CART career and his first on a street course; he was presented the Greg Moore Pole Trophy by Ric Moore, father of the hometown favorite who was tragically killed during the 1999 Marlboro 500 in Fontana. Coincidentally, this was the first all-Forsythe front row since Milwaukee in 1998, where Carpentier and Moore also went 1-2 in qualifying.
I'm really pleased and honored. I got pretty emotional when Mr. Moore presented the trophy. We're all racers and want to do well, but to do it here in Canada in front of all of our fans and friends makes it even more special. And to have both blue and white Player's cars on the front row is a great tribute to Greg.
The top four cars were all separated by less than one-hundredth of a second. Nevertheless, de Ferran, who was starting 3rd with a 1:00.933, was less than enthusiastic with his qualifying performance:

It was a little bit frustrating session for us. I wasn't extremely happy with the car in the morning and we made some changes in the car and improved it a little bit, but it wasn't perfect. I had quite a lot of oversteer, and I had some good laps going only to mess it up in one of the last three corners. But it is what it is. That's what qualifying is all about. You need to have a complete lap, and the start/finish line isn't in Turn 9. I just couldn't get it together.


=== Race ===
Morning warmup saw threatening showers looming in the mountains outside of Vancouver, but for the time being the track was still dry. da Matta led the 30-minute session before the race began.The green flag waved for the first time just after 2:00 PM as Tagliani led the field into Turn 1. Junqueira, trying to pull to the outside of the queue, clipped the front of Tracy and spun; he managed to keep it out of the tire barriers but ended up stalling the car. Meanwhile, side-to-side contact between Bräck and Castroneves meant that the latter was forced off-track at Turn 3, where he also stalled the car. Junqueira was able to get restarted relatively quickly, but the position of Castroneves' car meant that a full-course caution was needed to get him refired. Both cars would head into the pits for service and go a lap down.
During the opening caution, Alex Zanardi, Wilson, and Bryan Herta all went into the pits to top off on fuel, anticipating a strategy change later in the race.
The green waved again on Lap 5, where Moreno was able to get around Bräck and take 4th place after starting 7th. Tagliani was looking to extend the gap between him and 2nd place Carpentier as the stint continued and by Lap 15 he had pulled out a five-second gap between them. On Lap 24, Moreno was finally able to get around de Ferran for 3rd place. At the same time, points-leader Castroneves came to a stop on the start-finish straight with an electrical problem, forcing the second caution of the day.
This was the signal for all the cars to pit for fuel and tires, with Tagliani leading the way. The two Forsythe cars remained 1-2, while thanks to a quicker pit stop, de Ferran was able to edge out of the pits ahead of Moreno and retake the position. The only cars that did not pit were Scott Dixon, Memo Gidley, and Wilson; this slotted Dixon into 2nd and Gidley into 4th. Castroneves was able to get the car restarted, but he was now three laps down.
The field went back to green on Lap 30 with Tagliani again pulling away. Tracy, who was trying to tuck in behind Fernández going into Turn 6, was clipped from behind by da Matta, who lost part of his front wing. Suffering from a right rear puncture, Tracy pulled onto the runoff area at Turn 1 and retired the car, the official cause being a gearbox malfunction that resulted from the collision with da Matta. The race continued under green as Tracy's car was removed. From Papis in 9th on back, the field was running nose-to-tail. On Lap 34, Moreno once again passed de Ferran on track to take 4th place. From there he immediately pulled away and began hounding Carpentier for 2nd place. One lap later, Wilson was forced to pull off track at Turn 6 and retire from the race with a mechanical problem.
On Lap 41 both Dixon and Gidley finally made their pit stops, falling down the order. At the same time, leader Tagliani was beginning to lap the field, going around Herta. Dixon, who was battling for position at the back of the pack with fresher tires, collided with Tora Takagi at Turn 6, forcing him off the track and stalling the car. Almost simultaneously, Zanardi hit the tire barriers going into Turn 7, spilling water that had collected from the previous night's rain all over the track. The 3rd caution came out as a result of Zanardi's retirement, while Dixon was able to get restarted, albeit he was now a lap down. This was Zanardi's 7th DNF of the season, the most of any drivers in the series.
CART officials sent out the jet dryers to Turn 7 in order to dry the track during the caution; the cleanup took longer than expected as the water kept seeping back onto the track from the tire barrier.
Finally, on Lap 51, the green flag came back out with Tagliani leading. Takagi, one lap down, was positioned behind Tagliani on the restart, and over the next several laps he tried to get around Tagliani and get back on the lead lap. Unable to pass, the two cars raced ahead of the field while Bräck and Moreno kept pace with Carpentier.
Finally, on Lap 69, Papis and Andretti pulled into the pits for their scheduled stops, both falling back down the order. Meanwhile, the race took a dramatic turn as Tagliani, who had reported a strange noise to his crew just laps earlier, was helpless as a large plume of smoke erupted from the back of his car, forcing him to pull off-course and retire from first place.
Since Tagliani had managed to avoid bringing out a caution, his teammate Carpentier and 3rd place Bräck pulled into the pits for their scheduled stops, handing the lead to Moreno. Moreno then gave up the lead to Cristiano da Matta one lap later when he made his pit stop.
The drama continued when Papis clouted the wall in Turn 4, destroying the right-side suspension, putting him out of the race and bringing out the full-course caution. The yellow gave the rest of the field a perfect opportunity to pit as da Matta, Franchitti, and Jimmy Vasser each made a stop for fuel and tires. This handed the lead to Michel Jourdain Jr. and Oriol Servià, who had only made one pit stop so far. Both cars would pit a few laps later, now giving the lead to Maurício Gugelmin. While the order continued to shuffle under yellow, CART officials penalized da Matta, Franchitti, and Vasser for pitting when the pits were closed by forcing all three drivers to the back of the queue.
On Lap 80, the green came back out with Gugelmin leading and Moreno and de Ferran behind. At Turn 1, de Ferran braked hard on the inside and forced Moreno wide to take 2nd place away. 4th place Bräck misjudged his braking point and went wide at the same corner, dropping him back several positions. Just behind him, Fernández slid into the tire barriers and stalled the car, ending his day. The race continued under green as de Ferran stormed past Gugelmin on the back straight to take 1st place. At Turn 6, da Matta tangled with Takagi, sending the former into the tire barriers and forcing him to retire as well. Officials finally waved the full-course yellow in order to get both da Matta and Fernández off the track.
The yellow meant that every car except Castroneves and Herta was now back on the lead lap and could go the rest of the race without pitting, setting up a field-wide battle for position near the end of the race. The green waved on Lap 85 with de Ferran leading, but more trouble ensued when Bräck ran into the back of Carpentier, sending both cars off track and giving Carpentier a flat right rear tire. Bräck fell from 5th to 8th place as a result of the incident, while Carpentier was forced to limp around the circuit back to pits to change tires; he would be put a lap down.
Just a few corners later, Vasser ran off-track after punting the back of Christian Fittipaldi, who had locked up going into the corner. He severely damaged his front wing and was forced to retire from the race. At the same time, Gugelmin was struggling to keep pace with the leaders and began to fall back; going through Turn 6 he was passed by Andretti and Kanaan when he clipped the front wing of Servià, who was also trying to pass.
Despite the carnage and bits of debris on track, CART officials kept the race under green. On Lap 87 they announced that the race would be timed and would not go the full 100 laps.
On Lap 89 Moreno passed de Ferran to take the lead with less than ten minutes remaining in the race. From then on, he pulled away, leaving the rest of the field behind. The rest of the race was incident-free, and Moreno remained unchallenged as he took the checkered flag for his second career win.


=== Post-Race ===
Moreno was incredibly emotional as he circled around for his victory lap, performing donuts on the start-finish straight and celebrating on victory lane with his team and the Brazilian flag draped around his shoulders. A very popular driver in the series, he was holding back tears as he raised the winner's trophy and gave interviews.For Moreno, this would be his second and final CART victory, as well as the last for Patrick Racing before it folded in 2004. Despite the good result, Moreno would have horrendous luck for the rest of the season, scoring only two points at Surfer's Paradise for pole position and leading the most laps; he would ultimately DNF at five of the last six races of the season and was dropped from the team for 2002. Moreno would come back to CART in 2003 racing for Herdez Competition and score one final career podium at Miami. Moreno was also the sixth different winner at Vancouver in as many years and he gave Toyota its first win of the season on a street course.
This morning when we went out for warmup, we knew straight away that we had a good car. We found something this morning that was important, and that was that the car was better on new tires, so we went out and did just one lap on the new tires to get the shine off. And then the weather cooperated too. I told my engineer not to do too much to the car because it was good ... With about five laps to go I started crying in the car, and I started thinking about Greg [Moore]. I would like to dedicate this race for Greg. We all wish he was still here, and we think about him all the time when we're up here, so I'd like to dedicate this race for him.
de Ferran recorded his fifth podium of the year, continuing an upward trend that would ultimately earn him two wins and the season championship. His 2nd place also vaulted him into 1st place in the drivers' standings ahead of his teammate Castroneves, becoming the third different points leader in as many races.Andretti was pleased with his podium finish, as he continued his streak of strong points finishes in Canada and earned his sixth podium in Vancouver. He would go on to score another podium in Surfer's Paradise by the end of the season.
This would be Alex Zanardi's final race before his career-ending crash at the 2001 American Memorial in Germany two weeks later.

128,1999 Molson Indy Vancouver,"The 1999 Molson Indy Vancouver was a Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) motor race held on September 5, 1999 at Concord Pacific Place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was the 16th round of the 1999 CART season. Juan Pablo Montoya won the race from pole position and led nearly every lap en route to his seventh win of the season, followed by Patrick Carpentier and Jimmy Vasser.
Despite leading all but one lap during the race, Montoya was hampered by the wet racetrack and the pace of his championship rival Dario Franchitti; at one point, both drivers touched on track, spinning Franchitti out and ending his chances at winning the race. The race also saw multiple crashes as drivers struggled to navigate around the soaking wet racetrack.

129,2000 Molson Indy Vancouver,"The 2000 Molson Indy Vancouver was a Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) motor race held on September 3, 2000 at Concord Pacific Place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was the 15th round of the 2000 CART season. Paul Tracy won the race by less than half a second over his teammate Dario Franchitti with Adrian Fernández taking third place.
The race was an emotional affair, as it was former CART driver Greg Moore's home event and the first since his death at the 1999 Marlboro 500. His number, #99, was retired before the start of the race while Canadian sports legend Wayne Gretzky (who also sported #99 during his NHL career) gave the command to start engines.
Franchitti was handily leading the race until he stalled the car during a pitstop under caution, allowing Tracy to streak by in the pitlane and into first place. While the race did not see a lot of on-track passing, multiple cars were taken out as a result of crashes and on-track incidents. A total of 63,677 fans attended the event.

130,Molson Indy Vancouver,"Molson Indy Vancouver was an annual Champ Car race held in a street circuit near BC Place and running past Science World in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada held in July, August or September from 1990 to 2004. 
On September 2, 1990, the first race took place on the original circuit, which was won by Al Unser Jr. From 1998, a new circuit was created to the east of the old Pacific Place, where only a small part of the original circuit was used. The circuit was popular with drivers and often produced an entertaining race. For most of its fifteen years, the Vancouver Indy attracted in excess of 100,000 spectators over the course of its weekends, and in 1996 held the Canadian single-day sporting event attendance record until it was beaten by the Formula 1 Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal that year.  The final event in 2004 had race day attendance of 63,000 with a total three day turnout of 158,420 spectators.  However, from 2004, Vancouver was left off the Champ Car fixture list, and no race has taken place since.


== Controversy and cancellation ==
For much of its time in Vancouver, the Molson Indy was a source of considerable local controversy, as local residents complained of the noise and disruption caused by this major event. As the lands of the former Expo 86 site were developed into the billion-dollar condominium development by Concord Pacific, debates raged over whether the Indy made Vancouver a ""world-class city"" or an ""urban nightmare."" Such debates were chronicled by Mark Douglas Lowes in his 2002 book, Indy Dreams and Urban Nightmares: Speed Merchants, Spectacle, and the Struggle over Public Space in the World-Class City.The official explanation for the cancellation came from Jo-Ann McArthur, president of sponsoring Molson Sports and Entertainment, who stated that ""the bottom line is the business model couldn't work"". The race had just two seasons left in the city, due to the impending construction of the Olympic Village for the 2010 Winter Olympics on the south end of the course. She stated that the lack of a long-term commitment to holding the event made it difficult to attract sponsors to continue the race.Following the cancellation, Champ Car continued to race in the Canadian cities of Toronto, Montreal and Edmonton as part of the 2005 season.

132,Cambie Bridge,"The Cambie Bridge is a six-lane symmetric, precast, varying-depth-post tension-box girder bridge spanning False Creek in Vancouver, British Columbia.  The current bridge opened in 1985, but is the third bridge at the same location.  Often referred to as the Cambie Street Bridge, it connects Cambie Street on the south shore of False Creek to both Nelson and Smithe Streets in the downtown peninsula.  It is the easternmost of False Creek's fixed crossings; the Burrard and Granville bridges are a little more than a kilometre to the west, and the new Canada Line SkyTrain tunnel is built just west of the Cambie Bridge.


== History ==
The first Cambie Street Bridge, opened in 1891, was built as a simple piled-timber trestle with a trussed timber swing span near the middle. It cost $12,000 (CAD).


=== Second bridge ===

The next bridge was a four-lane, medium level steel bridge, 1,247 metres (4,091 ft) long and carrying streetcar tracks.  It was completed in 1911 for $740,000, opening to traffic on May 24, 1911. The following year, Canada's Governor General, the Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, accompanied by the Duchess and their daughter, Princess Patricia, visited Vancouver to officiate at a ceremony renaming the new crossing as the ""Connaught Bridge"" on September 20, 1912. The name ""Connaught"" never caught on, and most people continued to call it simply the ""Cambie Street Bridge"", after the street that runs across it, Cambie Street, named for pioneer Vancouver resident Henry John Cambie.
The navigation span was a steel through-truss swing span which the city would open on four hours' notice. In 1953, it opened 79 times. Even in its later years, it was opened once or twice a week. The trusses of the swing span projected through the bridge deck, dividing the two outer lanes from the two inner lanes. This contributed to many motor vehicle collisions. In April 1915, the creosoted wood deck caught fire, with the collapse of a 24.4-metre (80 ft) steel side span.


==== Early images, including 1915 fire damage ====

		
		


=== The present bridge ===

A new, higher, non-opening bridge was built in 1983–85 to replace the 1911 structure.  The entire Cambie crossing was closed for nine months, starting November 1984, while the present, six-lane, concrete bridge was merged with the existing approaches. The new bridge cost $52.7 million and was opened on December 8, 1985, after being built to a tight timescale so as to be available for Expo 86 in May 1986. City engineer W.H. Curtis was assisted by E.A. West, Assistant City Engineer, Streets & Structures, who was closely involved in its construction.
The 1985 bridge is of a twin post-tensioned prestressed concrete type in a continuous span. The total structural length is 1,100 metres (3,600 ft); it carries 6 lanes of traffic and a 14-foot (4.3 m) pedestrian walkway. The colouring of the concrete was obtained through the addition of volcanic ash from Mount Lassen to the mix.Under the bridge's south end is the Neighbourhood Energy Utility, a city-owned heat transfer station that provides heating and hot water to all new buildings in Southeast False Creek.Both sides of the bridge include pedestrian sidewalks separated from motor vehicle traffic by concrete barriers.  The Cambie Bridge ranks second of the three False Creek bridges by measure of pedestrian crossings. A 2002 study measured over 1,500 pedestrians crossing the Cambie Bridge in 11 hours on a weekday.  The wider east sidewalk is shared with bicycles.  Bicycles are also permitted on the bridge roadway in both directions.The Cambie Bridge is often used as part of the running route for events such as the Vancouver Sun Run, the BMO Vancouver Marathon, and the CIBC Run for the Cure.Two TransLink bus routes cross the Cambie Bridge: 17 and N15. On January 17, 2018, the City of Vancouver plans to remove a car lane using it as a bike lane. It noted that the volume of motor vehicles using the bridge has decreased on the last 20 years with at least 80,000 bike trips daily on the bridge. The bike lane was officially constructed on June 2, 2018 which opened on June 25.

133,Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden,"The Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden (simplified Chinese: 中山公园; traditional Chinese: 中山公園; pinyin: Zhōngshān Gōngyuán; Jyutping: Zung1saan1 Gung1jyun4) is the first Chinese or ""scholars"" garden built outside of China, and is located in Chinatown in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is located at 578 Carrall Street and consists of a freely accessible public park and a garden with an admission fee. The mandate of the garden is to ""maintain and enhance the bridge of understanding between Chinese and western cultures, promote Chinese culture generally and be an integral part of the local community.""


== History ==

The garden was built in 1985–1986. The outer park was designed by architects Joe Wai and Donald Vaughan, while the inner garden was conceived by Wang Zu-Xin as the chief architect, with the help of experts from the Landscape Architecture Company of Suzhou, China. Funding for the project came from the Chinese and Canadian governments, the local Chinese community, and other public and private sector sources, and it opened on April 24, 1986, in time for Expo 86.Because the winter climate in Vancouver is similar to that of Suzhou, many of the same plant varieties are found in the garden as in its Suzhou counterparts. The plants were chosen according to their blossom schedules in order to emphasize seasonal changes, especially the ""awakening"" in spring. They are also selected to invoke the symbolic, historical, and literary meaning of each plant and are used sparingly, in contrast to western gardens, and provide colour through all the seasons.Classical Chinese gardens employ philosophical principles of Feng shui and Taoism, striving to achieve harmony and a balance of opposites. Craggy rocks, for example, are juxtaposed against delicate foliage. Water is also an important element of the garden, and the large pond offers stillness, sound, a reflection of the sky, and helps to unify the other elements. Fish and turtles live in the garden and also serve a symbolic purpose. Bats, dragons, and phoenixes are represented in objects throughout the garden. Numerous large rocks are strategically placed and are intended to represent mountains concealing and revealing park elements.

The garden is named in honour of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, a nationalist leader who is considered the ""father of modern China."" The attribution is not arbitrary, as it emphasizes his connection with Vancouver. While traveling the world to raise awareness of, and funding for, the Chinese nationalist movement, Sun Yat-Sen stayed in Vancouver on three occasions for extended periods. At the time, there was a significant presence of Chinese nationalists in British Columbia, who helped finance the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing Dynasty in 1911. Sun Yat Sen subsequently became the first president of the Republic of China.The Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Park and Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden are two separate entities, linked by the artificial pond. While the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden is all of the above, the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Park is a public park built in a Chinese style, with mostly North American materials.


== In popular culture ==
The Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden was used as the backdrop for many episodes of Season 4 of Falling Skies. The Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden also appears in Season 5 Episode 1 of Psych, titled ""Romeo and Juliet and Juliet"". The Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden was also the site of a calligraphy task during the second episode of The Amazing Race Canada 1.

138,The Warehouse Studio,"The Warehouse Studio is a multi-media recording facility and photography studio in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, owned by Bryan Adams.


== Building ==
Originally built by the Oppenheimer Brothers in June 1886 as Vancouver's first wholesale grocery business, it also served as Vancouver's City Hall after the city was decimated by fire. For most of its 115+ year history the building held a glass factory and storage warehouse for Pilkington Glass Company.The building later fell into terrible disrepair and became abandoned. In 1989 the property at 100-102 Powell St. was purchased by Bryan Adams.The building at 102 Powell was gutted and converted into a parking lot with green space hidden behind a street front facade. The 2nd building, the original Oppenheimer Warehouse on the corner was restored and converted into a three-storey state of the art studio. Importantly, Adams was sure to maintain the building's character and charm by preserving the original brick and beam construction. The project took nearly a decade to complete.In 1998, The Warehouse Studio received a City of Vancouver Heritage Award for outstanding restoration of a historic building.


== Studios ==


=== Studio 1 - SSL 4072 G+ ===
On the main floor is a large format analog mixing room with a 72 input Solid State Logic G Series console with Total Recall and Black E Series EQ. It also has an isolated recording space and a small lounge and kitchen.This console was previously installed in the basement of Bryan Adams' former West Vancouver residence on Mathers Avenue. While he was on tour, Adams would allow other bands to record and mix there until his plan to create a studio complex in the heart of Vancouver could be realized.


=== Studio 2 - Neve A6630 ===
Located on the second floor is the main tracking room. The dimensions of the live room are 32 ft by 58 ft with a 24-ft ceiling and three isolation booths. There is also a lounge area, a long table for dining, full kitchen services, and a small fire escape patio.


==== Neve A6630 console ====
The Neve A6630 installed in Studio 2 is one of the three legendary custom-ordered consoles built for Sir George Martin. Built in 1979, it was installed in AIR Studios London on Oxford Street. It later found a home in Atlantic Studios in New York, until Bryan bought it in 1991. Ron Obvious rebuilt and modded the console and it was installed into Studio 2.It is a split console, with 58 channels, 24 busses, and a 32 channel tape monitor panel (58x24x32). The mic pres are remote, meaning the actual preamps (34427 modules) are housed in rolling carts on the live room floor. The mic trim pot on the console sends a control voltage to the pre. The main 52 channels have 31106 EQ modules.Console Modifications include:

6 custom ""Sleve"" strips: an SSL mic pre and EQ circuitry housed in a Neve channel strip.
SSL quad buss compressor
Pre-eq insert points


=== Studio 3 - Avid S6 ===
Studio 3 was originally a mixing studio that featured a Solid State Logic 9080J series console. In October 2013 the large analog SSL was shut down and sold off to make way for renovations and a change in the function of the studio. 12 months later the 3rd floor studio reopened with a new floor plan that now includes an isolated recording and more spacious control room. Most of the processing equipment stayed but the centre piece is now a 24 fader Avid S6 controller with 32 hardware inserts.


=== Studio 4 ===
Also on the main floor, the smallest of the studios was designed and built with budget conscious artists in mind but still features top quality equipment like Neve 1081 mic pre amps and Pro Tools HD.


== Technical ==
Acoustic and technical considerations for The Warehouse Studio during design, construction and operation were handled by Ron ""Obvious"" Vermeulen with Adams providing guidance on the character and aesthetic details. When Ron ""O"" retired in 2003 his long time mentor John Vrtacic took over as Technical Director for 6 years until he died in August 2009. Vrtacic's apprentice David Backus is now the Technical Director.

139,City School (Vancouver),"Vancouver is a city on the north bank of the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington. It is the largest suburb of Portland, Oregon. Incorporated in 1857, Vancouver had a population of 161,791 as of the 2010 U.S. census, making it the fourth-largest city in Washington state. Vancouver is the county seat of Clark County and forms part of the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area, the 23rd largest metropolitan area in the United States. Originally established in 1825 around Fort Vancouver, a fur-trading outpost, the city is located on the Washington–Oregon border along the Columbia River, directly north of Portland. In 2005, Money magazine named it No. 91 on its list of best places in America to live. In 2016, WalletHub ranked Vancouver the 89th best place in the U.S. for families to live.


== Etymology ==
Vancouver shares its name with the larger city of Vancouver in southern British Columbia, Canada, approximately 300 mi (480 km) to the north. Both cities were named after sea captain George Vancouver, but the American city is older. Vancouver, British Columbia was incorporated 29 years after the incorporation of Vancouver, Washington, and more than 60 years after the name Vancouver was first used in reference to the historic Fort Vancouver trading post on the Columbia River. City officials have periodically suggested changing the U.S. city's name to Fort Vancouver to reduce confusion with its larger and better-known northern neighbor. Many Pacific Northwest residents distinguish between the two cities by referring to the Canadian city as ""Vancouver, B.C."" and the United States city as ""Vancouver, Washington,"" or ""Vancouver, USA."" Local nicknames include ""Vantucky"" (though this is often used as a derogatory term) and ""The 'Couv(e)"".


== History ==

The Vancouver area was inhabited by a variety of Native American tribes, most recently the Chinook and Klickitat nations, with permanent settlements of timber longhouses. The Chinookan and Klickitat names for the area were reportedly Skit-so-to-ho and Ala-si-kas, respectively, meaning ""land of the mud-turtles."" First European contact was made by William Robert Broughton in 1792, with approximately half of the indigenous population dead from smallpox before the Lewis and Clark Expedition camped in the area in 1806. Within another fifty years, other actions and diseases such as measles, malaria and influenza had reduced the Chinookan population from an estimated 80,000 ""to a few dozen refugees, landless, slaveless and swindled out of a treaty.""Meriwether Lewis wrote that the Vancouver area was ""the only desired situation for settlement west of the Rocky Mountains."" The first permanent European settlement did not occur until 1824, when Fort Vancouver was established as a fur trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company. From that time on, the area was settled by both the US and Britain under a ""joint occupation"" agreement. Joint occupation led to the Oregon boundary dispute and ended on June 15, 1846, with the signing of the Oregon Treaty, which gave the United States full control of the area. Before 1845, American Henry Williamson laid out a large claim west of the Hudson's Bay Company (including part of the present-day Port of Vancouver), called Vancouver City and properly registered his claim at the U.S. courthouse in Oregon City, before leaving for California.  In 1848, Williamson had it surveyed and platted by Peter Crawford. In 1850, Amos Short traced over the claim of Williamson and named the town Columbia City. It changed to Vancouver in 1855. The City of Vancouver was incorporated on January 23, 1857.Based on an act in the 1859–60 legislature, Vancouver was briefly the capital of Washington Territory, before capital status was returned to Olympia, Washington by a 2–1 ruling of the territory's supreme court, in accordance with Isaac Stevens' preference and concern that proximity to the border with Oregon might give some of the state's influence away to Oregon.U.S. Army Captain (and future President) Ulysses S. Grant was quartermaster at what was then known as Columbia Barracks for 15 months beginning in September 1852. Soon after leaving Vancouver, he resigned from the army and did not serve again until the outbreak of the American Civil War. Other notable generals to have served in Vancouver include George B. McClellan, Philip Sheridan, Oliver O. Howard and 1953 Nobel Peace Prize recipient George Marshall.Army presence in Vancouver was very strong, as the Department of the Columbia built and moved to Vancouver Barracks, the military reservation for which stretched from the river to what is currently Fourth Plain Boulevard and was the largest Army base in the region until surpassed by Fort Lewis, 120 miles (190 km) to the north. Built on the old company gardens and skirmish range, Pearson Army Field (later Pearson Field) was a key facility, and at one point the US Army Signal Corps operated the largest spruce cut-up plant in the world to provide much-needed wood for airplanes. Vancouver became the end point for two ultra-long flights from Moscow, USSR over the North Pole. The first of these flights was performed by Valery Chkalov in 1937 on a Tupolev ANT-25RD airplane. Chkalov was originally scheduled to land at an airstrip in nearby Portland, Oregon, but redirected at the last minute to Vancouver's Pearson Airfield. Today there is a street named for him in Vancouver. In 1975 an obelisk was erected at Pearson Field commemorating this event.The neighborhood of Sifton was the terminus of an early electric trolley operated by the Northcoast Power Company that also served nearby Orchards from 1910 until 1926. The trolleys made ten stops and ran once per hour, charging 15 cents each way. A mural in the heart of Orchards depicts the trolley and the rural character of the area at the time it was operating. The community was named after Doctor Sifton, a promoter of the trolley service.According to the archives of the Vancouver Columbian newspaper, the Orchards-Sifton route went along Vancouver's Main Street to 26th, then out 26th to K Street and thence north to 33rd. From there, it ran on 33rd over Burnt Bridge Creek and past the city limits. At that point the trolley became more like a regular train as it followed a cut through the wilderness. Few houses were seen between Vancouver and Orchards. The public's preference for motor cars in the 1920s heralded the end of the trolley.
Separated from Oregon until 1917, when the Interstate Bridge began to replace ferries, Vancouver had three shipyards just downstream which produced ships for World War I before World War II brought an enormous economic boom. An Alcoa aluminum plant opened on September 2, 1940, using inexpensive power from the nearby New Deal hydropower turbines at Bonneville Dam. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Henry Kaiser opened a shipyard next to the U.S. Army base, which by 1944 employed as many as 36,000 people in a twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week production of Liberty ships, landing ship tanks, and escort carriers. This influx of shipyard workers boosted the population from 18,000 to over 80,000 in just a few months, leading to the creation of the Vancouver Housing Authority and six new residential developments: Fruit Valley, Fourth Plain Village, Bagley Downs, Ogden Meadows, Burton Homes and McLoughlin Heights. Each of these was later incorporated into the city, and are well-known neighborhoods, while the neighboring ""shipyard city"" of Vanport, Oregon, would be destroyed by the Memorial Day flood of 1948.
Vancouver has recently experienced conflicts with other Clark County communities because of rapid growth in the area. The city's first annexation more than doubled its size in 1909, with the largest annexation of 1997 adding 11,258 acres (45.56 km2) and 58,171 residents. As a result of urban growth and the 1997 annexation, Vancouver is often thought of as split between two areas, East and West Vancouver, divided by NE Andresen Road. West Vancouver is home to downtown Vancouver and some of the more historical parts of the city, as well as recent high-density mixed-use development. East Vancouver includes the communities of Cascade Park East and West, which had populations of 6,996 and 6,956 in 1990 before annexation.
More than one-third of the Vancouver urban area's population lives in unincorporated urban area north of the city limits, including the communities of Hazel Dell, Felida, Orchards and Salmon Creek. If county leaders had approved a major annexation plan in 2006, Vancouver would have passed Tacoma and Spokane to become the state's second-largest city.


== Geography and climate ==
Vancouver is located just north of the Columbia River, just west of where the Columbia River Gorge bisects the volcanic Cascade Range and just east of where the Willamette River enters the Columbia. The city of Vancouver is in the Western Lowlands region of Washington. When clouds do not blanket the Puget-Willamette trough formed by the Cascade and Coast Range, Mount Hood, Mount St. Helens, Mount Jefferson and Mount Adams are all visible from Vancouver.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 49.86 square miles (129.14 km2), of which, 46.46 square miles (120.33 km2) is land and 3.40 square miles (8.81 km2) is water.Vancouver lies just north of Portland, Oregon and shares a similar climate. Both are classified as warm-summer Mediterranean (Csb) on the Köppen climate classification, with certain key exceptions. High pressures east of the Cascade Range create something of a venturi effect, leading to cold east winds down the Columbia River Gorge. Unsheltered by the Willamette Valley, Vancouver has historically seen colder temperatures, including ""silver thaw"" storms where freezing rain cakes limbs and power lines. Such storms can paralyze Vancouver. This occasionally freezes the river, and in 1916 cut electric power in the city for almost two weeks. Rainfall occurs frequently throughout the fall, winter, and spring, but ceases around the middle of June, with dry and warm weather lasting through September. Average annual precipitation is 42 inches (1,100 mm). Heavy snowfalls are infrequent and snow often falls and doesn't stick, with major snowstorms only occurring every 2–4 years. Close proximity to the river was also a concern for flooding, before dams constricted the river, destroying features such as Celilo Falls. Periodic floods have been a nuisance, with two of the most destructive in June 1894 and May 1948. The 1948 Memorial Day flood almost topped the Interstate Bridge's support piers and completely destroyed nearby Vanport, Oregon. Other unusual storms include the Columbus Day windstorm of 1962 and an April 5, 1972 tornado which rated F3 on the Fujita scale, striking a local school. An EF1 tornado struck on January 10, 2008 just after noon causing moderate damage along a 2-mile (3.2 km) path from Vancouver Lake to the unincorporated Hazel Dell area.Because many Vancouver residents work in Portland, there is typically significant rush hour traffic congestion on two bridges that cross the Columbia River – the Interstate Bridge and the Glenn Jackson Bridge.  In 2017 there were 297,932 weekday vehicle crossings on the two bridges.

== Economy ==

The Vancouver economy is characterized by border economics with neighboring Portland, Oregon. The state of Washington levies no individual or corporate income taxes and levies a property tax below the national average and a sales tax above the national median. The State of Oregon has even lower property taxes and no sales tax but one of the highest state income taxes. As a result, many Vancouver residents prefer to shop in neighboring Portland where they do not pay sales taxes, then live and work in Vancouver where they do not pay state income tax. (Washington residents who work in Oregon must pay Oregon income tax.) For the same reasons, the city is popular with retirees. Conversely, the city is less favored by students and young adults. In 2003, 70% of workers in Vancouver worked in Clark County. There is a risk in sales tax avoidance because Washington has a use tax due on all purchases made in Oregon that are then returned to Washington. Vancouver residents ""shop at their own risk"" when attempting to avoid the sales tax in Washington, although the rule is rarely, if ever, enforced except for purchases requiring registration, such as motor vehicles.
The taxation and demographics of the area depresses the retail sector of Vancouver's economy. Oregon has stricter development laws to protect the timber industry; therefore, Vancouver tends to attract a higher proportion of the region's sprawling development. The voting base also led to rejection of extension of Portland's light-rail system into the city for several years. In 2013, Washington transitioned away from being a control state.
The economic history of Vancouver reflects the region. Moving from a salmon- and trade-based indigenous economy by the Chinook people, the Hudson's Bay Company pioneered extractive industries such as the fur trade and timber. Subsistence agricultural gave way to market and export crops such as apples, strawberries and prunes. Largely bypassed by the railroad in the 1880s, when the Oregon Steam Navigation company would ferry trains across the river downstream from St. Helens, Oregon to Kalama, Washington, early downtown development was focused around Washington Street (where ferries arrived), lumber and Vancouver Barracks activities such as a large spruce mill for manufacturing airplanes. A 1908 railroad swing bridge across the Columbia allowed greater industrial developments such as the Standifer Shipyard during the first world war. With the Interstate Bridge and Bonneville Dam Vancouver saw an industrial boom in the 1940s, including the Kaiser shipyard and Alcoa, as well as a Boise Cascade paper mill, just west of the Interstate Bridge.As the old-growth forests were depleted and heavy industry left the United States, Vancouver's economy has largely changed to high tech and service industry jobs, with many residents commuting to Portland. Vancouver contains the corporate headquarters for Nautilus, Inc., ZoomInfo, Papa Murphy's Pizza and The Holland (parent company of the Burgerville, USA restaurant chain).

The Port of Vancouver USA operates a port on the Columbia River, which separates Oregon to the south and Washington to the north. It handles over 400 ocean-going vessels annually, as well as a number of barges which ply the river and its tributaries as far as Lewiston, Idaho.
The Vancouver Energy project was a proposed crude oil transport hub in the Port of Vancouver USA.  It was estimated to produce the equivalent of $1.6 billion in employment income during the terminal's construction and for its first 15 years of operation. Vancouver Energy ended its bid to build the hub in February 2018 following Governor Jay Inslee's rejection of the project.


=== Largest employers ===
According to the City's 2012 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the largest employers in the city are:


=== Downtown revitalization ===
In 1997, the city of Vancouver decided to dedicate the next 15–20 years to redeveloping and revitalizing the downtown core, west of I-5 and south of Evergreen Boulevard. The first projects started in the early 2000s with the construction of many tall condominium structures around Esther Short Park. The most lauded outside investment was the construction of a Hilton hotel directly across from the park.
The Downtown redevelopment of Vancouver continued after a slowdown during the 2009–2012 recession. Numerous projects began to rise up around the city core and as of mid-2020 more than three dozen projects with mid-rise or high-rise structures were completed, under construction, or proposed.

In 2016 the first ground was broken for the ambitious $1.5 billion, 21-block redevelopment of Vancouver's waterfront at the former site of Boise Cascade Paper Mill. The site had been inaccessible to the public for more than 100 years. The project was planned for 3,300 residential units, and roughly 1 million square feet of office and retail space. Around 15,000 people were in attendance for the official grand opening, in 2018, of the project and associated public space including Grant Street Pier, a cable-stayed viewing deck that extends out over the Columbia River.The Redevelopment of Terminal One master plan was approved by the city council in 2017. This $500 million project will include multiple phases over several years including a seven-story AC Marriott hotel that began site preparation and construction in late 2019. Future plans in the master plan called for a mixed-use complex of mid-rise buildings on four blocks and a complete rebuild of the original 100-year Terminal One dock and pier. A public open-air market is also planned. 

The Columbian newspaper finished building a new seven-story building adjacent to the Hilton in 2008. Early in 2010, The Columbian filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and the building defaulted to Bank of America. In June 2010, the City of Vancouver agreed to purchase the former downtown Columbian office building for use as a new city hall. The city bought the two-year-old building and 5.14 acres (20,800 m2) for $18.5 million, a fraction of the $41.5 million sale price the owners of The Columbian office building had been asking prior to filing for bankruptcy. In 2011, the city consolidated five separate buildings housing 300 employees into one at the new City Hall, located at 415 W. 6th St. The move is saving the city approximately $1 million a year in facility lease and maintenance costs.The Fort Vancouver Regional Library District opened a new library on C Street at Evergreen Boulevard in 2011. Future plans on C Street include a new Marriott hotel and roughly 250 new condominiums. Other planned projects in the downtown area include:

Library Square, a mixed-use project which includes a condominiums building, hotel/condominiums building, office building, and a new main library.
The Luxe, a six-story office and condominium building.
Waterfront Redevelopment, which includes 10K Residents Envision, retail, offices, and parks.
Prestige Plaza, a six-story building which includes condominiums and offices.

== Architecture and notable buildings ==

		
		
		
		
		
Mother Joseph was one of the first architects in the region, and because of its relatively long history, Vancouver contains a variety of buildings. Homes vary from Victorians and craftsman bungalows downtown, to small wartime tract housing and ranch-styles mid-town, with rural styles and larger homes in the outer ring. In addition to the reconstructed Fort Vancouver at the Fort Vancouver National Historic Site, the city was named one of the National Register of Historic Places' ""Dozen Distinctive Destinations"" for 2003.Other notable buildings in Vancouver include:

The Covington House at 4201 Main Street, a log cabin and boarding school built 1846–1848
Officers Row, including the Grant House (first house on the Columbia Barracks) and the Queen Anne-style 1866 Marshall House
Mother Joseph's Providence Academy, dedicated in 1873, where Evergreen Boulevard crosses Interstate 5
The Proto-Cathedral of St. James the Greater (formerly St. James Church) saw its first Roman Catholic Mass celebrated August 16, 1885
The Carnegie library at Sixteenth and Main, which opened on New Year's Eve 1909, to showcase its unusual electric lights; it is now the site of the Clark County Historical Museum
The 1914 Chicago-style U.S. National Bank (now the Heritage Building) at sixth and Main
The 1916 U.S. Post Office at 1211 Daniels Street
The vertical-lift Interstate Bridge, which opened on February 14, 1917, Oregon's 58th anniversary
The 1935 art deco telephone exchange building at Eleventh and Washington
The 1941 Clark County Courthouse, designed by prolific local architect Day Hillborn
Smith Tower, a round downtown apartment building for the elderly, built in 1965
The Hilton Hotel and Vancouver Convention Center across from Esther Short ParkMany of these buildings have been re-purposed. The 1867 Slocum House, an Italianate villa-style residence originally built one block south of its current location in Esther Short Park, was moved to its present location in 1966 and now houses a winery and art gallery. The Carnegie Library was expanded in the 1940s, becoming the Clark County Historical Museum after a new library was built in 1963. Other buildings have been torn down for urban renewal or renovated to house professional offices for lawyers and accountants.


== Art and culture ==

In the early 2000s, Vancouver began seeing a revitalization of local art scene and cultural events. In 2010 there was a movement among local artists to form cooperatives and meet with established local gallery owners for a monthly forum known as ""Art Conversations."" Many of Vancouver's art galleries are located in downtown Vancouver, and in 2014, the City Council formally designated an ""Arts District"" in the downtown core.The Kiggins Theatre located within the Downtown Vancouver Art District, was built in 1936 by architect Day Hillborn. It was named for J.P. Kiggins, an entrepreneur and politician who cut a swath through town in the early 20th century, serving as Vancouver's mayor for 15 non-consecutive years between 1908 and 1935. It was renovated and reopened in 2011 as an independent film and community event venue.
The Vancouver Symphony Orchestra first formed in the late 1970s. Conducted and directed by Dr. Salvadore Brotons, the Symphony regularly performs concerts.


== Annual events ==
Every June since 2006, the Recycled Arts Festival held in Esther Short Park has featured the work of dozens of artists whose creations are made from at least 75% reused or recycled materials, along with live music and food.Since the mid-1960s, Vancouver hosted a Fourth of July fireworks display on the grounds of Fort Vancouver National Historic Site that draws many people to the city. The display routinely ran to 45 minutes, attracted up to 60,000 visitors and was broadcast on area television, one of the largest west of the Mississippi River. Due to the death of key organizer ""Mister Fireworks"" Jim Larson and a poor economy, the show was not held in 2009. A shorter, redesigned show debuted in 2010 and brought in approximately 35,000 people. As of 2019, The Historic Trust (formerly the ""Fort Vancouver National Trust"") continues to organize the fireworks event.4 Days of Aloha, also known as the Hawaiian Festival, takes place in late July in Esther Short Park, Clark College, and Fort Vancouver. Started in 2012 by ""Aunty"" Deva Yamashiro, a hula dancer and self-appointed cultural ambassador for Hawaii, the festival features live music, dance performances, craft workshops, and a celebration of Hawaiian food, arts, and culture.Late August features the Vancouver Wine and Jazz Festival in Esther Short Park, which brought 13,500 attendees in 2012 and which is considered the largest jazz festival in the Pacific Northwest.


== Local media ==
Vancouver is located within the Portland media market for print, radio, and television media. It does, however, serve as the hometown for some media, including:

The Columbian
The Oregonian (based in Portland, Oregon; also covers some southwest Washington news)
The Vancouver Voice was, at one time, southwest Washington's only alternative periodical, published from 2006 to 2011.


== Transportation ==

Vancouver has two interstate freeways, I-5 and I-205, both of which run north–south, across the Columbia River into Portland and toward Seattle. It also has two heavily travelled state highways within the city limits. SR 14 begins at I-5 in downtown Vancouver and makes its way east. It is a freeway all the way until Camas. SR 500 begins from I-5 at 39th Street in north Vancouver, travels east connecting with I-205, and continues east into the suburb of Orchards where the freeway terminates at Fourth Plain Boulevard, and meets with the south end of north–south-oriented 117th Ave., SR 503. A third state highway, SR 501, starts at I-5 and heads west through downtown and continues along a path that runs between the Columbia River and Vancouver Lake.  Route 501 – SR501 dead ends a few miles north of Vancouver.
The area's mass transit system is C-Tran, the Clark County Public Transportation Benefit Area Authority, which operates 135 buses, vanpools, and paratransit vehicles. There are also a number of express routes into Portland's downtown.
In 1995, Clark County voters defeated a ballot measure that would have funded extension of Portland's MAX Light Rail system north into Vancouver. Opposition to paying for light rail was strong at that time, but slowly declined over the following several years, eventually leading Vancouver officials to begin discussing the idea again. Meanwhile, TriMet reconstituted its planned MAX line to Vancouver as a shorter line running only within Portland, which could potentially be extended across the river and into Clark County at a later date. This extension of the MAX system opened in 2004 as the Yellow Line, running as far north as the Portland Expo Center, approximately 1 mile (2 km) south of downtown Vancouver. Vancouver voters have rejected light rail operations monies in connection with the Columbia River Crossing proposal.Vancouver has always been well served by rail; current freight railroads operating in Vancouver include the BNSF, Union Pacific, and the local shortline Lewis and Clark Railway.  Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Vancouver Station. The long-distance Coast Starlight and Empire Builder serve the city, as well as the regional Amtrak Cascades.
Pearson Field, located near downtown Vancouver, is the main airport serving the city. The airport is intended primarily for general aviation without any commercial air service. The nearest commercial airport is Portland International Airport (PDX).
In 2008, Vancouver passed a citywide law requiring anyone on a wheeled device such as a bicycle, skateboard, scooter or skates to wear a helmet while on any sidewalk, street, trail or other public property. Many local cyclists opposed the law as a misuse of city funds and police efforts, as well as encroachment on personal freedoms. Despite opposition from the public, the Vancouver City Council passed the measure 5–1 with then Mayor Royce Pollard saying, ""...statistics be damned. I support this.""


== Sister cities ==
Vancouver has one sister city:
 Joyo, Kyoto, Kansai, JapanVancouver previously had a sister-city relationship with Arequipa, Peru, between 1961 and 1993, but that relationship ended.

140,HMCS Discovery,"HMCS Discovery is a Royal Canadian Navy Reserve division and shore facility based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Created during World War II from the Vancouver Half Company of the Royal Naval Canadian Volunteer Reserve, Discovery was used for recruitment and training, and provided almost 8,000 personnel during the war. Discovery continued in its training role following the war, and also serves as headquarters for several Reserve and Cadet units.
The stone frigate takes its name from HMS Discovery, the ship used by George Vancouver to chart most of North America's north-western coast. Originally based at the Stanley Park Barracks, in 1944 Discovery moved to its current location on Deadman's Island, in Coal Harbour, adjacent to Stanley Park.
Her Majesty's Canadian Ship (HMCS) Discovery has a crew of about 140 officers and non-commissioned members (NCMs). The 2018 command team consists of: Commanding Officer, Commander Bryan Price; Executive Officer, Lieutenant-Commander Stuart Evans; Coxswain, Chief Petty Officer Second Class Susie Robinson.


== History ==


=== World wars ===
Discovery traces its history to the creation of the ""Number 2 (Vancouver) Company"" of the Royal Naval Canadian Volunteer Reserve at the beginning of the First World War. This small group was composed of 87 members of the Royal Vancouver Yacht Club who served and were demobilized at the end of the war. It was not until May 1924 that Lieutenant-Commander J.W. Hobbs was given permission to form the first ""Vancouver Half Company"" of the Naval Volunteer Reserve. Robert Louis Stevenson's schooner Casco was used for a time to train cadets in the 1920s.
During the Second World War, the role of the reserves increased, reflecting the need to maintain sufficient manpower for the war effort. On 1 November 1941, the division was newly commissioned as HMCS Discovery and it moved into Stanley Park Barracks. In 1944, the unit was permitted to occupy Deadman Island in Stanley Park and turn this property into a training facility. During the Second World War, Discovery was one of the greatest sources of naval recruits in Canada, having enrolled 372 officers, 6,974 ratings and 650 Wrens (Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service – WRCNS). Of those, 15 were killed in action. At the end of the war, Discovery became the discharge centre for the whole of the British Columbia mainland, and 8,378 men and women were discharged through the base.


=== Modern era ===
HMCS Discovery continues to serve as a training facility, force generating personnel for Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) operations. Discovery personnel have been deployed to Korea, the Persian Gulf, Egypt, Bosnia and Afghanistan. The facility provided support for the 1997 APEC meeting in Vancouver. It was the Olympic Maritime Operations Centre for the 2010 Winter Olympics and conducted port security around the country. 
It is also the site of the Western Region Diving Centre, coordinating the efforts of the various port inspection diving teams at Naval Reserve Divisions in Western Canada. The unit continues to serve as host and ambassador to dozens of foreign vessels visiting the Port of Vancouver. 
In addition to the Naval Reserve, Discovery houses Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps Captain Vancouver and Navy League Cadet Corps Captain Rankin. Discovery is also the site of the Naval Museum of Vancouver and Vancouver Naval Veterans Association.


== Badge ==

It was suggested by Sir Arthur W. Cochran, KCVO, Clarenceaux King of Arms that the badge of HMCS Discovery take the form of a rebus. It depicts a gold disc on top of a shake-fork that looks like the letter Y; a ""disc over Y"".

141,King George Secondary School,"King George Secondary School is a public secondary school located in the West End of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
The school is located in the West End, with two elementary schools feeding in. Some students are from other areas of Vancouver who wish to be in a smaller school environment.
Since July 2006, King George Secondary has been approved by International Baccalaureate (IB) to offer the International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme for students in grades 8, 9, and 10, as one of the only 3 schools in the city to offer the MYP Programme.
The school is adjacent to the West End Community Centre, enabling youth to get more involved in their programs.


== Special programs ==
King George is an IB MYP approved school, offering such program to the students of grades 8, 9, and 10.
King George is noted for its Technology Immersion program which lasts from grade 8 to 9. Students in the programme use iPads to enhance their core subjects. Most of their assignments are completed online through King George's Moodle online learning system, which was implemented at the school by Tech Immersion graduates along with a new website in early 2011. Students learn HTML along with traditional computing tasks, as well as how to use professional applications including Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe InDesign. Students who participate in this program are known in their school as ""techies"" and have a unique opportunity to have half of their courses with the same group of people for two years. The Technology Immersion program can be followed by several computer-oriented courses in grades 10-12.
King George also hosts City School, a program for grades 10, 11 and 12 that involves students leaving the traditional secondary school setting to work in a more challenging, independent setting, with a different schedule, smaller groups of people, and only a few different teachers. This program is described as a ""school within a school"". City School, established in 1971, is Vancouver's oldest alternative program.Formerly, a third program called Gateway was also offered by the school. Unlike Tech Immersion or City School, this program was provided off school ground and maintain limited ties to the school. Gateway Alternate Education Program was aimed at at-risk youth who have been absent from schools for a some time and those who were homeless. Only those who were referred by the Ministry of Children and Family Development or VSB could register and attend this program.

142,Deadman's Island (Vancouver),"Deadman Island is a 3.8 ha island to the south of Stanley Park in Coal Harbour in Vancouver, British Columbia. The indigenous Squamish name is ""skwtsa7s"", meaning simply ""island."" Officially designated ""Deadman Island"" by the Geographical Names Board of Canada in 1937, it is commonly referred to as Deadman's Island. It has been a battle site, a native tree-burial cemetery, smallpox and squatter settlement in its long history.  Today it is the site of Vancouver's Naval Reserve Division, HMCS Discovery. While the island is DND Property that is leased to the City of Vancouver it is subject to land title claims of the Musqueam Nation.


== Early history ==
One of Vancouver's first white settlers, John Morton, visited the island in 1862. Morton discovered hundreds of red cedar boxes lashed to the upper boughs of trees and one had evidently fallen and broken to reveal a jumble of bones and a tassel of black hair. The island was the tree-burial grounds of the Squamish people. Undeterred, Morton took a fancy to the island and attempted to acquire it. He changed his mind when Chief Capilano pointed out that the island was ""dead ground"" and was a scene of a bloody battle between rival tribes in which some two hundred warriors were killed. It's said that ""fire-flower"" grew up at once where they fell, frightening the foe into retreat. The macabre name of the island is thought to reflect this history, although the Squamish name is simply skwtsa7s, meaning ""island.""Settlers continued to use the island as a cemetery prior to the 1887 opening of Mountain View Cemetery. Between 1888 and 1892, Deadman Island became a quarantine site for victims of a smallpox epidemic and burial ground for those who did not survive.


== Ludgate affair ==
This small islet again became the site of conflict when Theodore Ludgate leased the island from the federal government in 1899, to the chagrin of the mayor and other civic officials who assumed that it was included in the original Stanley Park land grant. Mayor James Garden, with police accompaniment, tried to prevent Ludgate from clearing the land by reading the first ever Vancouver riot act after a showdown between Ludgate's men and the police. Ludgate escaped arrest, and police guards were left on the island, but the protracted legal battle that followed gave Ludgate the opportunity to proceed with his plan to build a saw mill and log the island. By 1911, Ludgate had won his case, cleared the island of both trees and the squatter community that lived there. Ludgate was subsequently unable to meet the terms of his lease, and the island reverted to the Dominion government. In 1930 the island was offered to the city by the federal government to be used as a park, but a park never materialized, and it was instead turned into a naval station in 1944.


== Her Majesty's Canadian Ship Discovery ==
HMCS Discovery is Vancouver's Naval Reserve Division that is housed in the stone frigate that is  strategically located on the island in support of the security of Vancouver Harbour. The facility housed the Joint Maritime Operations Centre for the APEC Summit in 1997 and the 2010 Winter Olympics. In addition to the Naval Reserve Division, RCSCC Corps 47 Captain Vancouver and NLCC Captain Rankin have their weekly parades at HMCS Discovery and the facility houses a naval museum. The island is connected to the mainland of Stanley Park at low tide, as well as via a short timber-structure bridge.


== Future of the island ==
The city's lease of Deadman Island from the federal government expired in 2007  and was subsequently renewed in 2008. The former mayor of Vancouver, Sam Sullivan, ""envisioned it as the home for a ferry shuttle from downtown, a maritime museum and a building to celebrate the island's aboriginal heritage."" The Musqueam First Nation, however, claim the island as part of its land claim in the area. The island's future remains with the Department of National Defence and its status controversial, as it has been through much of Vancouver's history.

143,Burrard Bridge,"The Burrard Street Bridge (sometimes referred to as the Burrard Bridge) is a four-lane, Art Deco style, steel truss bridge constructed in 1930–1932 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The high, five part bridge on four piers spans False Creek, connecting downtown Vancouver with Kitsilano via connections to Burrard Street on both ends. It is one of three bridges crossing False Creek. The other two bridges are the Granville Bridge, three blocks or 0.5 km (0.31 mi) to the southeast, and the Cambie Street Bridge, about 11 blocks or 2 km (1.2 mi) to the east. In addition to the vehicle deck, the Burrard Bridge has 2.6 m (8 ft 6 in) wide sidewalks and a dedicated cycling lane on both sides.
The architect of the Burrard Street Bridge was George Lister Thornton Sharp, the engineer John R. Grant. The bridge's two close approach spans are Warren trusses placed below deck level, while its central span is a Pratt truss placed above deck level to allow greater clearance height for ships passing underneath. The central truss is hidden when crossing the bridge in either direction by vertical extensions of the bridge's masonry piers into imposing concrete towers, connected by overhead galleries, which are embellished with architectural and sculptural details that create a torch-like entrance of pylons. Busts of Captain George Vancouver and Sir Harry Burrard-Neale in ship prows jut from the bridge's superstructure (a V under Vancouver's bust, a B under Burrard's).
Unifying the long approaches and the distinctive central span are heavy concrete railings, originally topped with decorative street lamps. These pierced handrails were designed as a kind of visual shutter (stroboscopic effect), so that at a speed of 50 km/h motorists would see through them with an uninterrupted view of the harbour. The effect works at speeds from about 40 to 64 km/h.


== History ==

The Burrard Street Bridge, opened July 1, 1932, was built to provide a high-level crossing from Vancouver to the southwestern neighbourhoods in Kitsilano, by connecting Burrard Street to Cedar Street. After completion, Burrard was extended through to the base of downtown and Cedar Street disappeared.

A snip of a pair of golden scissors in the hands of Mayor Louis D. Taylor,  and Vancouver's $3 million Burrard Street Bridge was opened to the public Friday afternoon, July 1 ... Hardly was the ribbon cut in front of the devouring eyes of movie cameras, then thousands of pedestrians and hundreds of cars surged across the magnificent white structure in a procession of triumph, celebrating another step in Vancouver's progress
At the opening ceremony, entertainment was provided by two bands, the Kitsilano Boy's Band and the Fireman's Band. An RCAF seaplane flew under the bridge and later a sugar replica of the bridge was unveiled at the civic reception in the Hotel Vancouver.
G.L. Thornton Sharp, of Sharp and Thompson, was the architect responsible for the distinctive towers on the bridge and its middle galleries. ""Both central piers,"" Sharp told a reporter, ""were designed and connected with an overhead gallery across the road. This helped to mask the network of steel in the truss from the two approaches, and has been treated as an entrance gateway to the city.""  Along their other axis, the full height of the piers above the water also serve to frame a sea entrance gateway, notably for pleasure craft: ""by sea and land we prosper"".  The piers have provision for a rapid transit vertical lift span beneath the highway deck, never installed.


== Recognition ==
Burrard Street Bridge has been assessed by heritage consultants retained by the City of Vancouver as being in the top category of historic buildings in Vancouver.  The bridge appeared on a stamp issued by Canada Post in 2011, in a series showcasing five notable Art Deco structures in Canada.


== Proposed bicycle lanes or widening ==
When constructed, the Burrard Street Bridge did not have dedicated lanes for cyclists, who shared the bridge's six vehicle lanes with motorists. Later, as traffic volume grew and speed limits were increased on the bridge to 60 km/h, cyclists were directed to share the bridge's sidewalks with pedestrians. Over time, the volume of pedestrians and cyclists on the 2.6 m (8 ft 6 in) sidewalks created a dangerous situation, with several accidents occurring, which resulted in at least one successful lawsuit against the city.
Since the mid-1990s, the city of Vancouver has investigated various options to rectify the situation.  The two most prominent options were 1) to introduce bicycle lanes on the bridge's vehicle deck by reallocating one or more vehicle lanes, and 2) to build horizontal extensions on the outside of the bridge to create additional sidewalk space. Other options have included building an entirely new pedestrian and/or cyclist only bridge, and building another deck on the bridge below the existing deck.
Heritage advocates have been strongly opposed to the construction of outside sidewalk extensions, which would likely alter significantly the historical character of the bridge. Fiscal conservatives have also been opposed to high costs associated with this option.
Many motorists and others have opposed reallocation of vehicle lanes to bicycle lanes, believing that the reduction in vehicle carrying capacity would create excessive traffic problems both on the bridge and on and around alternate crossings, such as the Granville Street Bridge.


=== Timeline ===
Beginning March 26, 1996, in a six-month trial by the City, one commuter lane was closed to automobile traffic and made into a temporary cyclist lane. However, after one week, the City was forced to revert the lane to its original purpose, due to outrage by some motorists.
On May 31, 2005, a detailed engineering and planning report was presented to Council, reviewing the situation broadly, presenting alternatives, and offering recommendations. (Its computer visualizations of various proposals [esp. pp. 8–12—notably p. 8—and Appendix E] are indispensable illustrations to the discussion. See )
That day Vancouver City Council voted 10–1 not to follow the recommendations of the report, but to reallocate the two curb-side lanes to cyclists for another trial, as part of Council's plan to increase cycling in Vancouver by 10 percent for the 2010 Winter Olympics.
The issue was carried into the municipal election of November 19, 2005.
On December 20, 2005 the newly elected Council voted 6-4 to cancel the lane reallocation trial and to proceed directly to widening the bridge sidewalks as promised in that election.

In 2006, the City considered removing the concrete railings and widening the bridge deck by outward ('outrigger') sidewalks, at projected cost of over $40 million. (See p. 8 of ) To preserve the bridge's heritage value, such cantilevered structures would not include the bridge's central piers, or towers. Critics of this plan argued that the resulting ""pinch points"" would defeat the purpose of widening the bridge by creating bottlenecks, through which a greater number of cyclists, skaters and pedestrians must pass over coming decades.For the third consecutive year, in 2008 Heritage Vancouver listed the Burrard Bridge first on its Top Ten endangered sites in Vancouver. It had ranked fourth in 2005.Sidewalk expansion was delayed by the Squamish First Nation, which controls the land directly under the south (or west) side of the bridge. For construction to begin, the city would require permission from this group, which has expressed concern that machinery working on the site may affect their land.
The Squamish First Nation erected advertising billboards on their properties, located at that bridge approach, and is proposing the same for similar properties by the Lions' Gate Bridge and the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing.

In a late April 2008 report to Council, city engineers raised the estimated cost of widening to $57 million, due to reconsideration of the additional weight to the existing bridge structure and rising construction costs. $61 million was set as a more likely figure.In Nov. 2008 the current Council, which advocated widening the bridge, was defeated and replaced by a new mayor and Council opposed to the widening but supportive of lane reallocation from vehicles to cyclists. In late January 2009, in an economic downturn and anticipating the 2010 Winter Olympics, the City announced plans for trials of three kinds of auto traffic lane closings, allowing bicycle use of the road surface.  This would be supplemented by safety upgrades.In March 2009, the City of Vancouver delayed discussing the Burrard Bridge Bike Lane Trial at least one month.  [6].  Council rescheduled meeting to May 5, 2009 to discuss the three kinds of possible trials, to begin summer 2009, where one approved.On May 7, 2009, Council approved a motion to proceed with option 3 of the proposed trials, to begin in June 2009.  The proposed trial began on July 13.  It saw the southbound motor-vehicle curb lane and the northbound-side sidewalk allocated to bicycles, with the southbound-side sidewalk allocated to pedestrians.  The reassigned lane was separated from motor vehicles by a physical barrier. As part of the trial, traffic pattern changes to accommodate feeder bicycle traffic were also completed on Pacific St., next to the North bridgehead, over complaints from local merchants that cited lack of consultation and possible negative impacts on their businesses.   Three days into the trial, a local merchant reported a 46% drop in sales compared to the same days the year before.  Six weeks into the trial another local merchant reported a 25% drop in sales, and a local restaurant reported a 30% drop in sales.Regarding effects on three kinds of traffic: two weeks into the trial, the City of Vancouver released a data report showing daily bicycle travel across the bridge had increased by an average of 30%.  The same report indicated little change in pedestrian trips, a slight drop in motor vehicle trips, but no change in motor vehicle travel times between 12th Avenue and Georgia Street along Burrard via the bridge.In July 2009 a website allowing people to register opposition to the bike lane trail was set up by local realtor and former NPA parks candidate Keith Roy at www.unblockthebridge.ca [7].(On August 24, 2009 the Vancouver Police Department announced a sharp increase in bicycle theft, with the first three weeks of August experiencing a 53 percent increase over 2008, however, VPD spokesperson Constable Jana McGuinness denied a link between the rise in theft and the lane reallocation trial.)
By 2019, the bike lane on the Burrard Bridge had become the busiest bike lane in North America. The Downtown Business Improvement Association, which had originally opposed the conversion of vehicle lanes into bike lanes, stated that it endorsed cycling infrastructure because many employees and customers bike to downtown businesses.


== Electronic billboard ==
In December, 2009 the Squamish First Nation erected an electronic billboard on their land adjacent to the south end of the bridge on the west side.  It is visible to traffic travelling in both directions on the bridge and each screen (one for each direction) measures 9 metres wide x 3 metres tall.  The advertisements will cycle every ten seconds. 
There has been controversy and protest from neighbouring residents who claim the billboard is unsightly, blocks view corridors of the mountains and even that it is a dangerous distraction to drivers.
There are at least five other similar billboards going up near the Lions Gate Bridge and Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing as well as near the Stawamus Chief on Highway 99.
The billboards were approved by the federal government.  Local and regional governments have acknowledged they have no control over what is done on native reserve lands.  The Squamish Nation has said that the purpose of the billboards is primarily to make money.


== PCB contamination ==
There continues to be a significant problem with PCB contaminants at the bridge; in 2012 Vancouver City Council allocated $14 million in funding over two years to the removal of PCB contaminants from the Burrard and Granville bridges.

== History ==
The school was first established on the third floor of the Wong Benevolent Association Building in 1925., providing lessons in Chinese cultural customs and language, particularly Cantonese, to Canadian-born children of Chinese descent.
By 1937, the Mon Keang School was one of ten Chinese language schools in Vancouver, with classes at these schools funded primarily by groups such as family associations, the Chinese Freemasons, and churches. Like all of the other schools at the time, the Mon Keang School only offered elementary-level language classes until after World War II, when it became the first school to provide language classes at the secondary level. Instructors at the school were mainly from China, who were only allowed to immigrate under exemptions from the Chinese Immigration Act, 1923 (now known as the Chinese Exclusion Act) in effect at the time.Wong Kown Fow, a teacher and principal at Mon Keang School from 1936 to 1969, noted that the school officially used Cantonese to teach its students, but many of its instructors also used a mixture of both Cantonese and Toisanese.In 2011, the school officially closed and stopped offering classes due to declining enrolment.In 2016, the Youth Collaborative for Chinatown - 青心在唐人街, a grassroots youth group based in Vancouver's Chinatown, began organizing Saturday School, a series of place-based Cantonese language learning classes that take place in the classrooms at the Mon Keang School and through field studies and trips to various other locations in Chinatown


== Building history ==
The school is housed in the Wong Benevolent Association Building, located on East Pender Street, on its third floor.

146,Granville Street Bridge,"The Granville Street Bridge is an eight lane bridge in Vancouver, British Columbia. It spans False Creek and is 27.4 metres above Granville Island. It is part of Highway 99.


== History ==


=== First bridge 1889 ===
The original bridge was completed in 1889. It was a 732-metre long low timber trestle. The navigation span, near the north end, was a trussed timber swing span, tied with wire ropes to a central wooden tower. It was largely designed by the CPR, and cost $16,000. In 1891 the bridge was widened on both sides for streetcar tracks, except where the tracks converged for the swing span.


=== Second bridge 1909 ===
The second bridge was completed in 1909. It was a longer, medium-level steel bridge with a through truss swing span.


=== Third bridge 1954 ===
On February 4, 1954, the current Granville Street Bridge, costing $16.5 million, opened. A million cars would cross over the bridge in its first month. The city of Vancouver funded the bridge itself as Mayor Frederick Hume said ""no formal assistance given by any other government body.""
The eight-lane structure was constructed on the same alignment as the first bridge while steel plate girders salvaged from the second bridge made barges for constructing the foundations of the Oak Street Bridge.
The first ""civilian"" to drive over the 1954 bridge was the same woman who was first to drive over the second bridge in 1909. She had been widowed between the two openings, and so had a different name. Both times she was at the wheel of a brand-new Cadillac.
Recent improvements to the bridge include increasing its earthquake resistance, and installing higher curbs and median barriers.


== Today ==
In December 2017, Vancouver City Council approved a plan to remove the ""Granville Loops"" - a pair of cloverleaf off-ramps connecting the bridge with Pacific Street - and open up the land to redevelopment.Since late 2018, the Granville Street bridge has being undergoing seismic retrofitting that will be completed in early 2021.In January 2019, Vancouver City Council announced a plan to improve pedestrian and cyclist access to the bridge from the surrounding neighbourhoods by creating a new separated bike and walking path located in the centre of the bridge roadway. The plan was opened up for public comment in April 2019.

The park includes a trail in Habitat Island, a walking/biking trail along the shoreline of False Creek, public art installations, picnic tables, benches, docks, a children's play area, a bridge constructed from sewer pipe, a water pump with metal runnels at the top of a small hill, and the Olympic Village dog park.


== History ==
The name of this park is based on the bend in Vancouver's street grid, where Cambie St. intersects with West 2nd Ave. This park was created as one of the amenities for the 2010 Winter Olympics athletes. It was designed to give historical reference to its former use as an industrial land, hence the bridge constructed from sewer pipe. The industrial land was named as a City Works Yard that was built in the 1920s which included an incinerator that assisted residents with waste disposal. The unsorted waste was burned and left highly contaminated the soil. This led to a reform of the land, and some suggested that the City Works Yard be made into an infrastructure theme park to educate people about the environmental effects of infrastructure.
The park was designed to clean storm water runoff before it reached the ocean. The park is a naturalized wetland, meaning this area of Vancouver was not originally a wetland environment prior to its construction. However, the wetland park has seemingly incorporated itself into the ecosystem and has become an important habitat to preserve wildlife.


== Ecology ==


=== Habitat Island ===
Habitat Island or Habitat Compensation Island was intended to be a shoreline created due to a Department of Fisheries and Oceans policy, in which requires a shoreline to be created when a portion of natural waterfront is lost to urban development. Habitat Island was constructed with left over excavation material (soil, rocks, and sand). As the island’s name implies, it provides a variety of small ecological habitats for a wide variety of plants and animals to thrive from.


=== Wildlife ===
The creation of Hinge Park and Habitat Island has incorporated freshwater wetlands, rocky inter-tidal zones, and shoreline forest habitats into the dense urban environment of Olympic Village. These novel habitats have promoted biodiversity by becoming a unique gathering spot for wildlife. Wildlife sightings in Hinge Park and Habitat Island include coyotes, river otters, raccoons, herring, beavers, and several species of waterfowl. Earlier in April 2013, a pair of beavers were first sighted in Hinge Park and have made the stormwater-fed wetland their home. Since establishing a local lodge in January 2015, the pair of beavers have quickly gained popularity over social media and is loved by many locals in the community. Since July 2016, up to three baby beaver kits have been spotted living with their parents. The urban habitat of Hinge Park is smaller than the usual habitats that beavers occupy, meaning the amount of available resources to allow the beaver population to thrive will be challenging. Currently, there are no plans to capture, kill, or relocate the beaver family, however trees have been wrapped in wire mesh to reduce the number of trees taken down by the beavers.
		


== Activities ==
Hinge Park includes a children's play area where there are a set of jungle ropes and a small climbing wall. Also, near the play area is a small hill with a slide, a water pump that can be used in the summer, and a big rusty tube bridge.  Furthermore, there is a walking and biking trail that connects with the rest of False Creek trail. There is another trail that leads to Habitat Island which is located north of Hinge Park which give hikers a view of False Creek across the river. Other activities include a dog off-leash area for owners to allow their pets to run freely. There are various dog meet ups across the Lower Mainland and Hinge Park can be one of those meet up locations. Other amenities located in the park include outdoor picnic tables, benches, and available parking. Food/beverage services and public washrooms are not available at the park, however, these amenities are available at Olympic Village Square located one block west of Hinge Park.
		
		
		


== Directions ==
Hinge Park is located on the Northwest corner of 1st Ave. and Columbia St. in the neighbourhood of Mount Pleasant, Vancouver. Being a local community park, there are multiple points of access into Hinge Park including Athletes Way, Walter Hardwick Ave., and running/biking trails along the South edge border of False Creek. The park is approximately a 10-minute car drive from the Vancouver City Centre Canada Line SkyTrain station; the interior of Downtown Vancouver.

 Alternatively, the park can be reached after a 10-minute walk from either the Olympic Village Canada Line SkyTrain station or the Main Street-Science World Expo Line SkyTrain station.

150,Vancouver Harbour Flight Centre,"Vancouver Harbour Flight Centre, Vancouver Harbour Water Aerodrome or Vancouver Coal Harbour Seaplane Base (IATA: CXH, ICAO: CYHC), is a registered aerodrome located at Coal Harbour in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The flight centre is within walking distance of the HeliJet heliport and Waterfront Station, a public transit hub in Downtown Vancouver.After five years of preparation, consultation and construction, Vancouver Harbour Flight Centre seaplane terminal opened for passenger service on May 25, 2011. The Vancouver Harbour Flight Centre is a partnership between the Clarke Group of Companies and Ledcor Group of Companies.It is classified as an aerodrome and as an airport of entry by Nav Canada. It is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). CBSA officers at this airport can handle general aviation aircraft only, with no more than 15 passengers.


== Control tower ==

The Vancouver Harbour Control Tower is the only one in Canada specifically for a water aerodrome. At 142 m (466 ft) above ground it is the highest control tower in the world. and is located on top of the Granville Square building. In 2009 the airport handled 54,741 aircraft movements, the 35th busiest in Canada. It is also the 8th busiest aerodrome in BC and the busiest water aerodrome in Canada. Itinerant aircraft movements (from one airport to another) for the aerodrome were 54,711 while local movements were 30.


== Operations ==

The actual aircraft docking area, at 49°17′26.44″N 123°07′08.90″W, is situated just west of Canada Place. This part of Burrard Inlet is listed by Nav Canada as a restricted area and no aircraft are permitted to take off, land or move through the zone at a high speed. Just north of Canada Place is a rectangular section called ""Area Alfa"", centered on the official coordinates, which is the main aircraft operating zone.In 2007, the link to Victoria Inner Harbour Airport was, according to the Official Airline Guide, Canada's busiest air route by the number of weekly flights.

151,Denman Arena,"Denman Arena was an indoor arena located in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia. The arena was located at 1805 West Georgia Street at the northwest corner with Denman Street. It opened in December 1911 and was destroyed by fire in 1936. Its primary use was for ice sports such as ice hockey. It was the home ice rink of the Vancouver Millionaires professional ice hockey team, and was the location of 1915 Stanley Cup championships. The arena was also used for other sports, musical performances and public assemblies. It was an assembly point for Canadian servicemen during World War I. The 10,500 seat arena was the largest in Canada at the time, and introduced mechanically frozen or ""artificial"" ice to Canada.


== Construction ==
In January 1911, Joe Patrick sold his Nelson, British Columbia lumber business for $440,000. The Patrick family moved to Victoria and the decision was made to use the proceeds of the company sale to go into the business of professional ice hockey. The family built the Denman Arena to support the new Pacific Coast Hockey Association professional ice hockey league, to be run by Joe's sons Frank and Lester Patrick. Both Frank and Lester were professional ice hockey players and had played in the National Hockey Association and other early professional leagues in Eastern Canada. Simultaneously, the Patricks also built the 4000-seat Patrick Arena in Victoria.
To build the Vancouver arena, the Patricks bought a parcel of land consisting of thirteen lots from the water's edge of Coal Harbour to Georgia Street, bounded by Denman and Chilco Streets. The location was near Stanley Park to the west, and was connected to the downtown business district by a streetcar line along Georgia Street. The site was previously the location of the Kanaka Ranch, which was settled in the 1860s by Hawaiian families, who grew fruit and vegetables, and produced charcoal, on the site.To finance the construction of the Arena, the Patricks formed the Vancouver Arena Company Limited, capitalized at $200,000. The company was divided into 1000 preferred shares and 1000 common shares, with a 10% annual dividend. The company issued an initial share offering, but by September 1911, the offering had only raised $1400. Two more investors signed on, but it was up to the Paticks to take the rest. To facilitate the playing of ice hockey in Vancouver's moderate climate, the Patricks imported mechanical ice freezing equipment that Frank and Lester Patrick had seen in operation at New York's St. Nicholas Arena. The Denman Arena opened on December 20, 1911, attracting 1500 people for a session of public ice skating. Denman Arena held 10,500 people, making it at the time, the largest indoor arena in Canada, one of the world's largest indoor arenas, and the second largest indoor arena in North America, after the second Madison Square Garden in New York City. The Arena was built at a cost of $226,382.In 1927, the Patricks built the 2,500 seat Denman Auditorium next to the Arena. The Auditorium, which was multi-purpose, survived the fire of 1936 and was renovated in 1952. It re-opened on September 10, 1952 as the Georgia Auditorium concert hall. It only lasted seven years before it was demolished in 1959, after the construction of the Queen Elizabeth Theatre.


== Usage ==
The Arena was the permanent home of the professional Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. The Arena was also the home of the New Westminster Royals from 1911 until 1914. The Patricks had hoped to set up teams in Calgary and Edmonton in the PCHA for the opening season, but the plans fell through. To avoid having a two-team league, the Patricks formed the Royals, to represent the neighbouring town of New Westminster and encourage fans to come to the Arena. Although the Royals were an unexpected necessity, the Royals were the winners of the first PCHA championship. The Royals were disbanded in 1914, when the PCHA formed a team in Portland, Oregon. The Millionaires were later renamed the Maroons and were disbanded in 1926 when the Western Canada Hockey League discontinued operations.
The Arena hosted the Stanley Cup ""World Series"" championship series four times. The 1915 series pitted the Millionaires versus the National Hockey Association's Ottawa Senators, the first Stanley Cup series held west of Winnipeg. The series was won by the Millionaires, and remains the only Stanley Cup won by a Vancouver team. The Arena also hosted Stanley Cup series in 1921, won by Ottawa, the 1923 series won by Ottawa and game two of the 1925 series, won by the Victoria Cougars.
During construction, the Patricks organized a four-team amateur ice hockey league, the Vancouver Amateur Hockey League, composed of the Vancouver Athletic Club, the Bankers, the Columbians and the Vancouver Rowing Club. In 1921, the Arena hosted the first international women's championship of ice hockey, organized by the PCHA. After the collapse of the Western Canada league, a new Pacific Coast Hockey League was organized, with the  Vancouver Lions playing out of the Arena. The PCHL lasted three years. In 1933, the Lions were revived in the North West Hockey League. The Lions continued after the destruction of the Arena, and a reconstituted PCHL began operations with the Lions as a member.
Two other ice sports clubs had their start at the Denman Arena. The Arena also had four curling rinks in the basement and the Vancouver Curling Club was established in December 1911. Curling was discontinued during World War I to make way for the armed forces. The Club re-organized in 1931 at the Pacific National Exhibition's Forum. The Club built its own facility in 1949. The Connaught Skating Club also was established in December 1911, and celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2011. During the 1920s, the Club held competitions and an annual ""Carnival"" show at the Arena. After the Arena burned down, Connaught moved to the Forum as well, and in 1965 moved to Richmond, British Columbia to Richmond's Minoru Arena.The Arena and Auditorium were also used for boxing and wrestling matches. The North Shore Indians of the Inter-City League played box lacrosse in the Arena in the 1930s.In 1914, the Arena was used to house over 1,000 soldiers who were assembling to form the 23rd Infantry Brigade. The soldiers left Vancouver in August 1914 to be deployed as the first Canadian troops in World War I.On October 21, 1924, the Arena was the site of a political radio broadcast by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, who spoke at Denman Arena during a tour of the west. It may have been the first political broadcast in Canada. Later that year, the telephone line installed was used for the first radio broadcast of an ice hockey game in British Columbia.On April 28, 1935, over 16,000 assembled at the Arena for a political rally by the CCF, the largest indoor gathering in Vancouver up until that time.The Denman Auditorium was taken over during World War II by the Canadian navy, then used as storage by Boeing Aircraft. It was bought in 1945 by H. M. Singer, who converted it back to a venue. Two notable rock and roll concerts took place in 1957, by a touring group of musicians known as ""The Biggest Show of Stars."" The lineup included Paul Anka, Chuck Berry, Eddie Cochran, Fats Domino, The Drifters, The Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, Buddy Knox and others. The Vancouver Symphony Orchestra regularly played at the venue during the 1950s. The final event at the Georgia Auditorium took place on June 19, 1959. It was a free show by the CBC Talent Caravan.Other musical performances at the Arena and Auditorium included performances by Maurice Ravel, Dizzy Gillespie, Glenn Gould, Charlie Parker, Oscar Peterson, Ella Fitzgerald, Jeanette MacDonald, Margaret Truman and others.


== Destruction by fire ==
The Arena was built of wood in 1911. Not long before 1936, the Arena was clad in brick to reduce its risk of burning due to fire. On the night of August 19, 1936, 4,000 fans had attended a boxing match by Max Baer. By 1:30 AM that night, a fire had broken out in the adjacent Coal Harbour area. Despite the recently added brick veneer, the fire spread to inside the Arena. The interior exploded into flame and the Arena could not be saved by Vancouver firemen. Stan Patrick, the youngest brother of Frank and Lester Patrick, and manager of the auditorium, attended the fire and was quoted as saying ""You think this is a good fire? You should have seen the one in Victoria. That was a pip!"" A lack of wind prevented the huge fire from spreading into downtown Vancouver. The overall damage of the fire was estimated at $500,000. Two persons were killed and three firemen injured. The Arena was destroyed, along with seven industrial buildings, two homes and fifty-eight small boats. The concrete floor of the Arena was not destroyed, and it was adapted into an outdoor dance floor named the Starlight.In 1945, the site of the arena was sold by Lester Patrick to Vancouver theatre owner H. M. Singer for $80,000. Singer planned to build a $1 million sports arena on the site, but the arena was never built. Singer managed the Auditorium as a concert venue until 1959.


== Site today ==
The site today is now part of Devonian Harbour Park. A historical marker has been placed at the foot of Denman Street, with information about the Arena, the Georgia Auditorium and Coal Harbour.

152,Engagement (sculpture),"Engagement is a series of sculptures by Dennis Oppenheim depicting two diamond engagement rings. One version was installed in 2005 at Sunset Beach in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Others are at the Nevada Museum of Art in Reno, Nevada, San Diego, California, Ruoholahti, Finland, and Leoben, Austria.


== Description and history ==

Engagement, installed at Sunset Beach in 2005, depicts two diamond engagement rings and stands nearly 30 feet tall. The diamonds, illuminated and tilting away from one another, are composed of translucent plexiglass boxes, steel and aluminum. The Vancouver Biennale described the sculpture as pop art. Engagement is one of several sculptures by Oppenheim that has been installed in Vancouver: The Device to Root Out Evil an upside-down aluminum church, was installed along the waterfront in Coal Harbour from 2005 to 2008, and Arriving Home was displayed within Vancouver International Airport as part of the 2009–2011 Vancouver Biennale.During November 11–17, 2007, Engagement was installed along the waterfront at Laurel and Harbor Drive in San Diego, California.


== Interpretation and reception ==
Oppenheim, who often declines to explain his works, kept the meaning of Engagement ambiguous on purpose. According to the San Diego Port, the work reminds spectators that ""marriage requires a balance between two people with different interests, tastes and backgrounds"" and represents the ""dichotomy of marriage, expressing the romantic and the melancholy"".Debates over same-sex marriage in Canada were taking place around the time the work was installed in Vancouver.

153,False Creek,"False Creek (French: Faux ruisseau) is a short inlet in the heart of Vancouver. It separates downtown from the rest of the city. It was named by George Henry Richards during his Hydrographic survey of 1856-63. While traveling along the south side of the Burrard Inlet, he thought he was traversing a creek; upon discovering his error, he gave the waterway its modern name.Science World is located at its eastern end. Proceeding east to west, it is crossed by the Cambie, Granville, and Burrard street bridges.  The Canada Line rapid transit tunnel crosses underneath False Creek just west of the Cambie Bridge. It is one of the four major bodies of water bordering Vancouver along with English Bay, Burrard Inlet and the Fraser River. In 1986 it was the location of the Expo 86 World's Fair.
False Creek South is a neighbourhood that runs along the inlet starting under the Granville bridge and runs until under the Cambie bridge to the east Southeast False Creek (Olympic Village) starts from Cambie to main street.


== History ==

Human settlement in the Lower Fraser region (including present-day Vancouver; see Lower Mainland) began between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago, following the retreat of the Sumas Glacier at the end of the last ice age. The settlement by peoples now known as the Coast Salish predates the arrival of salmon in the river between 4,500 and 5,000 years ago, an occurrence that took place symbiotically with the emergence of Douglas fir, western hemlock, and western red cedar ecosystems between 4,000 and 5,000 years before the present day. According to Squamish-Sto:lo author and historian Lee Maracle, Vancouver was inhabited by ""Downriver Halkomelem"" speaking peoples, the Tsleil-Waututh.Contact between Europeans and the indigenous peoples of present-day Vancouver occurred in June 1792. By 1812, Halkomelem peoples had survived three large epidemics from foreign illnesses such as smallpox, introduced through trading routes, including a 1782 outbreak that killed two-thirds of the population. It has been estimated that shortly before the time of first contact and these epidemics, the indigenous population of the Lower Fraser was over 100,000.An 1830 Hudson’s Bay Company census documented 8,954 indigenous inhabitants in the region, although the census was probably incomplete due to the omitting of an unknown number of settlements. As a result of epidemics, the population of the Tsleil-Waututh was reduced to 41 individuals by 1812, who invited the neighbouring Squamish to reside in Burrard Inlet.Shortly thereafter, a group of Tsleil-Waututh led by Khatsalahnough, a leader from Lil’wat (near present-day Pemberton), occupied present-day False Creek. At this time, there were large sandbars at its entrance. False Creek, which lies in Musqueam territory, was a shared waterway; in addition to the Tsleil-Waututh, the Squamish inhabited False Creek as well, occupying it year-round.Prior to European settlement, False Creek extended as far east as what is now Clark Drive, while Burrard Inlet was nearly a mile in width. With land reclamation extending into Burrard Inlet and False Creek for port and industrial uses, the landscape began to change dramatically. Once a vital source for Tsleil-Waututh, Musqueam, and Squamish food supplies such as sea asparagus, berries, camas, oysters, clams, wild cabbage, and mushrooms, False Creek became polluted with sewage and toxic effluent from sawmills and other industries. As a result, one nickname for False Creek was ""Shit Creek"".In 1913, the Squamish residents of the Kitsilano Reserve, on the False Creek sandbar, were forced to relocate. According to Maracle, the settlement was burned down following the forced evacuation. In 1916, the sandbar on which this settlement was located was built into Granville Island to create new industrial land. In 1917, the eastern basin of False Creek was infilled to create land for the Canadian Northern Railway's Pacific Central Station; transcontinental railway terminals such as this helped earn Vancouver the moniker of ""Terminal City"". Talk of draining and filling the inlet to Granville Street continued into the 1950s, but that never occurred.The False Creek area was the industrial heartland of Vancouver through to the 1950s, and was home to many sawmills and small port operations. As industry shifted to other areas, the vicinity around False Creek started to deteriorate. In 1960, BC Forest Products plant and lumber storage facility on the south side of False Creek caught fire in Vancouver's first-ever five-alarm blaze. Every piece of firefighting equipment and all of Vancouver's firefighters fought the blaze for hours, but the facility was totally destroyed.
The future of False Creek south was subsequently shaped by debates on freeways, urban renewal, and the rise of citizen participation in urban planning. Through the 1960s, the ruling NPA city government and senior city bureaucrats had hatched a plan - with little or no public consultation - to run freeways through the city. In the same period, the City razed large portions of Strathcona under the aegis of urban renewal. A group of influential citizens formed The Electors Action Movement (TEAM) to oppose the freeway and to radically change the way decisions were made on land use. A key figure amongst these people was Walter Hardwick, a Geography professor at UBC who envisioned the retrofit of this brownfield industrial site into a vibrant waterfront mixed-use community.
First elected to City Council in 1968, Dr. Hardwick led the City's redevelopment team and helped secure the participation of the Federal Government which owned Granville Island. A major public involvement and co-design process followed which established public priorities for an accessible waterfront seawall; mixed-tenure housing including market condominiums, co-op and low-income housing and live-aboard marinas; and a vibrant waterfront market. These plans were formalised in a 1972 Official Development Plan. The form and mix of development were revolutionary for Vancouver at the time. A third of the site was set aside for housing at 40 units/acre with the balance converted to park, waterfront and community uses.
The North Shore of False Creek (NFC) was further transformed in the 1980s, as it took centre stage during Expo 86. Following Expo, the Province sold the NFC site to Li Ka-shing who brought ideas of a higher density waterfront community to the downtown peninsula. Vancouver's experience with South False Creek and the public participation that shaped it was key to developing NFC as a liveable high-density community. For example, Ka-shing's company wanted to develop ""islands"" of market condos on the waterfront but was soundly rebuffed by the public and by planners who favoured the extension of a 100% publicly accessible waterfront and seawall. The 1991 Official Development Plan enabled significant new density commensurate with the provision of significant public amenities including street front shops and services, parks, school sites, community centres, daycares, co-op and low-income housing. Since then, most of the north shore has become a new neighbourhood of dense housing (about 100 units/acre), adding some 50,000 new residents to Vancouver's downtown peninsula.
On December 1, 1998, Vancouver City Council adopted a set of Blue ways policies and guidelines stating the vision of a waterfront city where land and water combine to meet the environmental, cultural and economic needs of the City and its people in a sustainable, equitable, high quality manner.
Southeast False Creek (SEFC) is the designation given to the neighbourhood bordered by Cambie, Main, West 2nd Avenue, and False Creek.  The 2010 Olympic Village, for athlete housing and logistics of the Winter Olympics, is found in Southeast False Creek. The City of Vancouver has plans to see this neighbourhood developed into a residential area with housing and services for 11,000-13,000 people.


== Sports and recreation ==
False Creek is a very popular boating area for many different activities including dragon boating, canoeing, kayaking, public ferries, charter ships, and visiting pleasure boats. It has 10 marinas with berths for 1500 watercraft and several paddling clubs or boat rental facilities. Since 1986, the creek has been the venue for the Canadian International Dragon Boat Festival and other paddling events.


== Transportation ==
Aquabus and False Creek Ferries are two ferry companies that operate scheduled services daily to and from multiple points along False Creek. In addition to three bridges and multiple bus routes, False Creek can also be crossed via the Canada Line in a tunnel between Olympic Village Station on the South shore and Yaletown-Roundhouse Station to the North.


== Environmental issues ==
Water quality is not suitable for swimming according to Vancouver Coastal Health. Persons exposed to water are advised to wash their hands and/or shower.Heavy rains may cause raw sewage to discharge right into the Burrard Inlet.


=== Impact on wildlife ===
Several decades following the suspension of industrial activity in the area, a number of shore and seabirds such as cormorants, ducks, herons, kingfishers, owls, geese, crows, and gulls have returned, as well as harbour seals. In an unusual sighting, in May 2010 a grey whale entered False Creek and traversed its length before returning to the open waters of the Strait of Georgia.Factors working against the further return of wildlife include residual industrial contaminants, spillage from the sewer overflow system into the creek, and the seawall that constrains much of the shoreline with little habitat value. The city has attempted to recreate the natural shoreline in some areas and is working to phase out the antiquated sewer overflow system.


== Architecture and urban planning ==

The False Creek area is an eclectic group of neighbourhoods with very different urban planning and architectural techniques/styles. The discrepancies between the north and south shores of False Creek are apparent from the built landscape but, as David Ley from the Geography department at UBC argues, these discrepancies are representative of the social, economic, and cultural movements from which they sprang. The Modern and Post-modern aesthetics that helped to shape western culture during the course of the last century were not wasted on architecture and urban planning either. These movements in art and culture had significant effects on the way people thought about and interacted with their environment and False Creek offers a good example of the disparate design elements and goals that characterise these respective approaches, and of the how the sequence of development changed in response to social pressures.


=== False Creek South ===
The south shore of False Creek has had quite a diverse history of land uses since its founding. South False Creek went from being an industrial park, in the late 1800s and mid 1900s, to being the populous residential area that it is today. The development of this area, beginning anew in the 1970s, occurred at a critical time in Vancouver’s history when citizens were organising support for a new picture of the city, one that broke away from the standardised utilitarian cities that were so popular in North America and, instead, pushed for a more liveable and diverse built environment. This neighbourhood, located on municipally and federally owned land, offered an opportunity for project leaders, often led by TEAM members, to create a new kind of space, what Ley calls a post-modern space. Architecture and urban planning that embrace diversity of design, human-scale proportions, open public spaces, historical and vernacular allusions, diverse demography and the trade of local goods reflect the post-modern goals of inclusion and tradition that were important to the project leaders behind South False Creek. The result is a medium-density area with a variety of architectural designs, ownership opportunities, recreational activities, and modes of transportation, which allows for easier mobility within the community and a more picturesque landscape to be enjoyed by residents and visitors alike. Bike paths, parks, unique three-story homes, a public market, and the intentional preservation of mountain-views, and other characteristics, distinguish the area of South False Creek as one of the earliest conscious attempts to create a more ""liveable"" environment for Vancouverites rather than focusing on efficiency and profitability as modernists are often criticised for doing. False Creek south is home to False Creek Elementary School. Having a mixed income neighborhood makes for a inclusive neighbourhood where money is not more important than the well being of your neighbour. False Creek South has a strong sense of community. 
False creek consists of 70% social housing and 30% leasehold apartments and condos
30% Low income below market (subsidised) rent. Including Metro Vancouver Housing, Portland Hotel Society, other organisation and societies.
30% Co-op housing rent geared to income but still quite Subsidised (below market)  
10%  Housing for people with special needs (Below market rents)
30% standard market rent apartments and leasehold condos.
All of False Creek South is on Leasehold land which is owned by The City Of Vancouver.
Southeast False Creek (Olympic Village) consists mostly of Market rate apartments and modern condos with a few co-ops and social housing. 


=== North False Creek ===
The north shore of False Creek, on the downtown peninsula, has undergone multiple stages of development since its purchase by the province from the  Canadian Pacific Railway in the early 1980s. Before the BC Cabinet bought the land of North False Creek to begin development for Expo ’86, the land was used for industrial purposes, however, provincial leaders developed a plan to build a sports stadium (BC Place), commercial outlets, and high-density residences on the newly cleared land. The circumstances surrounding the initial development phase of the northern shore of False Creek – strong provincial government involvement, incorporation of corporate partners, the appointment of Arthur Erickson as a project leader, etc. – worked to set the development of the area on a path to modernism with the primary goal being economic profit. BC Place and the accompanying high-density residences and commercial retailers set North False Creek in stark contrast to its southern neighbor, but the differences are more significant than design alone. Yes, the standardized condominiums and streets of the downtown peninsula may offer a more functional or efficient landscape for the modern worker, but even more, this kind of landscape, with its adherence to rational, large-scale, technological spaces, works to keep residents and visitors within the economic dynamo of the city. Although the early development decisions continue to play a role in the experience of the built environment in North False Creek, however, new strides have been taken by the land’s new owner Li Ka-shing, in response to public concerns, to create a more livable and accessible space, although the high-density and mixed use characteristics of the landscape were maintained in this case.
False Creek North is home to Cross town elementary school as well as Elsie Roy elementary school.

155,Carnegie Community Centre,"Carnegie Community Centre is located at 401 Main Street at the corner of Hastings Street, in the old Carnegie Public Library building in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, British Columbia. 
In 1901 Vancouver requested $50,000 from industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for the purpose of building a library. Carnegie agreed, provided the City of Vancouver supplied the site and contributed $5000 a year. The original public library was completed in 1903. For decades, the top floor was the home of the Vancouver Museum. The Vancouver Public Library moved into a more spacious building at 750 Burrard Street in 1957 and the Carnegie building eventually fell into disrepair. 
Neighbourhood poverty activists from the Downtown Eastside Residents' Association convinced city council to turn it into a public space for local residents, and it opened as the Carnegie Community Centre in the 1980s. It now houses recreation facilities, a low-cost cafeteria, a branch of the Vancouver Public Library, and a variety of services and programs for the neighbourhood, which is one of the poorest in Canada. The Carnegie Centre is a drug- and alcohol-free place.
The Carnegie Community Centre is owned by the City of Vancouver and funded by the Social Planning Department. It is open 9 a.m. to 11 p.m., every day of the year. 
The centre is run by Vancouver City Staff in cooperation with the board of directors of the Carnegie Community Centre Association, a non-profit society. Directors are elected annually from the members of the association. Membership costs one dollar per year and is available to neighbourhood residents. All the centre's programs are free to members.
Carnegie Community Centre has a gymnasium, a weight room, a theatre (aptly named Carnegie Hall), a cafeteria with very reasonably priced meals, a seniors lounge and a pool room. There is also an Adult Learning Centre on the top floor, which provides informal one-on-one tutoring. There is a computer lab containing multiple computers for educational use located inside the centre as well. 
The Carnegie Centre publishes a bi-monthly newsletter with articles concerning the Downtown Eastside Community.
The Institute for stained glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at Carnegie Community Centre. The Carnegie Centre supports and provides a home for a number of projects, including the political group known as CCAP (Carnegie Community Action Project), which has recently been associated with the anti-gentrification protests in the DTES.

156,English Bay (neighbourhood),"English Bay is a neighbourhood in the West End of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Though not formally defined, it is a commonly used local appellation that refers to the shopping and residential areas focused on the intersection of Denman and Davie Streets near at English Bay Beach. Generally, the term refers to the first few blocks of residential areas flanking the beach from Stanley Park to Sunset Beach, and to the commercial areas along Davie Street, and along Denman Street south of Nelson Street.","['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/English_Bay%2C_Vancouver%2C_BC.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Flag_of_Vancouver_%28Canada%29.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg']",49.2864000000000004320099833421409130096435546875,-123.1410000000000053432813729159533977508544921875
157,Wendy Poole Park,"Wendy Poole Park is a small triangular plot of parkland near the waterfront in the Downtown Eastside in Vancouver, British Columbia. The land is at Alexander Street and the Main Street
Overpass, and it was named by the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation for a young aboriginal woman who was murdered nearby in 1989. The park contains a memorial boulder inscribed with information about Poole.


== Wendy Poole ==
Wendy Poole was a member of the Tsay Keh Dene (""People of the Mountains"") a First Nations group from Northern B.C., near what is now the city of Prince George, British Columbia. She had moved to Vancouver, and was murdered on the second floor of a Downtown Eastside housing coop on January 26, 1989. Her body was later found in a nearby garbage dump. A man was arrested in connection with her death and was later acquitted. The murder case remains unsolved by police.


== History of the memorial ==
A coalition of First Nations, community groups, and individuals from the DTES campaigned, along with Roslyn Cassells, the then Party Commissioner of the Green Party of Canada, to name this small waterfront park after Wendy Poole. The proponents of the proposal hoped that the park would bring awareness to the unsolved cases of the missing women in the Downtown Eastside, and contribute to a healing process with First Nations people in the city.The official dedication ceremony was held on February 14, 2001, with
representation from Wendy Poole's family. The February date was picked to coordinate with the Annual DTES Women's Memorial March held on that date.
The 'Spirit's Rising Memorial Society' is joining women and youth at risk in a totem carving project, to be displayed in the park.Downtown Eastside activist Don Larson was involved in the campaign from the beginning.  Larson is a well-respected Vancouver social justice activist.

158,Downtown Eastside,"The Downtown Eastside (DTES) is a neighbourhood in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The area, one of the city's oldest, is the site of a complex set of social issues including extremely high levels of drug use, homelessness, poverty, crime, mental illness, and sex work. It is also known for its strong community resilience and history of social activism.
Around the beginning of the 20th century, the DTES was the political, cultural, and retail centre of the city. Over several decades, the city centre gradually shifted westwards and the DTES became a poor, although relatively stable, neighbourhood. In the 1980s, the area began a rapid decline due to several factors including an influx of hard drugs, the release of mentally ill individuals, policies that pushed prostitution and drug-related activity out of nearby areas, and the cessation of federal funding for social housing. By 1997, an epidemic of HIV infection and drug overdoses in the DTES led to the declaration of a public health emergency. As of 2018, critical issues include opioid overdoses, especially those involving the drug fentanyl; decrepit and squalid housing; a shortage of low-cost rental housing; and a high prevalence of severe mental illness, which often co-occurs with addiction.
The population of the DTES is estimated to be around 7,000 people. Compared to the city as a whole, the DTES has a higher proportion of males and adults who live alone. It also has significantly more First Nation Canadians, who are disproportionately affected by the neighbourhood's social problems. The neighbourhood has a history of attracting individuals with mental health and addiction issues, many of whom being drawn to its drug market and low-barrier services. Law enforcement policies have been described as being among the most progressive in Canada; however, residents suffer Canada's highest rate of death from encounters with police, and many vulnerable members of the community have low trust in the police.
Since the real estate boom began in the early 21st century, the area has been increasingly experiencing gentrification. Some see gentrification as a force for revitalization, while others believe it has led to higher displacement and homelessness. Numerous efforts have been made to improve the DTES at an estimated cost of over $1.4 billion as of 2009. Services in the greater DTES area are estimated to cost $360 million per year. Commentators from across the political spectrum have said that little progress has been made in resolving the issues of the neighbourhood as a whole, although there are individual success stories. Proposals for addressing the issues of the area include increasing investment in social housing, increasing capacity for treating people with addictions and mental illness, making services more distributed across the city and region instead of concentrated in the DTES, and improving co-ordination of services. However, little agreement exists between the municipal, provincial, and federal governments regarding long-term plans for the area.


== Geography ==

The term ""Downtown Eastside"" is most often used to refer to an area 10 to 50 blocks in size, a few blocks east of the city's central business district. The neighbourhood's issues are most visible in a stretch of Hastings Street around Main Street, which the Vancouver Sun described in 2006 as ""four blocks of hell.""Some indications of the borders of the DTES, which shift and are poorly defined, are as follows:

A 2016 analysis of crime in the DTES by The Georgia Straight focused on an area that consisted of a six-block length of Hastings and Cordova Streets, between Cambie Street and Jackson Avenue.
The City of Vancouver describes a ""Community-based Development Area"", in which places that are important to low-income residents are concentrated. This area includes Hastings Street from Abbott Street to Heatley Avenue, and the blocks surrounding Oppenheimer Park.
By some definitions, the DTES extends along Main Street to beyond Terminal Avenue, and the DTES also includes a strip of land adjacent to Vancouver's port.For some community planning and statistical purposes, the City of Vancouver uses the term ""Downtown Eastside"" to refer to a much larger area with considerable social and economic diversity, including Chinatown, Gastown, Strathcona, the Victory Square area, and the light industrial area to the north. This area, referred to in this article as the greater DTES area, is bordered by Richards Street to the west, Clark Drive to the east, Waterfront Road and Water Street to the north and various streets to the south including Malkin Avenue and Prior Street.
The greater DTES area includes some popular tourist areas and nearly 20% of Vancouver's heritage buildings.Strathcona in the 1890s included the entire DTES. By 1994 Strathcona's northern boundary was generally considered to be the alley between East Pender and East Hastings streets, though some place it at Railway Street, including DTES east of Gore Avenue.


== History ==

The DTES forms part of the traditional territories of the Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh, and Musqueam First Nations.  European settlement of the area began in the mid-19th century, and most early buildings were destroyed in the Great Vancouver Fire of 1886. Residents rebuilt their town at the edge of Burrard Inlet, between Cambie and Carrall streets, a townsite that now forms Gastown and part of the DTES. At the turn of the century, the DTES was the heart of the city, containing city hall, the courthouse, banks, the main shopping district, and the Carnegie Library.  Travellers connecting between Pacific steamships and the western terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway used its hundreds of hotels and rooming houses. Large Japanese and Chinese immigrant communities settled in Japantown, which lies within the DTES, and in nearby Chinatown, respectively.During the Depression, hundreds of men arrived in Vancouver in search of work. Most of them later returned to their hometowns, except workers who had been injured or those who were sick or elderly. These men remained in the DTES area – at the time known as Skid Road – which became a non-judgemental, affordable place to live as the main downtown area of Vancouver began to shift westward. Among them, drinking was a common pastime.  In addition to being a major cultural and entertainment district, Hastings Street was also a centre for beer parlours and brothels.In 1942, the neighbourhood lost its entire ethnic Japanese population, estimated at 8,000 to 10,000, due to the Canadian government's internment of these people. Most did not return to the once-thriving Japantown community after the war.In the 1950s, the city centre continued its shift westward after the interurban rail line closed; its main depot was at Carrall and Hastings. Theatres and shops moved towards Granville and Robson streets. As tourist traffic declined, the neighbourhood's hotels became run-down and were gradually converted to Single room occupancy (or SRO) housing, a use which persists to this day. By 1965, the area was known for prostitution and for having a relatively high proportion of poor, single men, many of whom were alcoholic, disabled, or pensioners.


=== 1980s ===

When we deinstitutionalized, we promised [mentally ill] people that we would put them into the community and give them the support they needed. But we lied. I think it's one of the worst things we ever did.
In the early 1980s, the DTES was an edgy but still relatively calm place to live. The neighbourhood began a marked shift before Expo 86, when an estimated 800 to 1,000 tenants were evicted from DTES residential hotels to make room for tourists. With the increased tourist traffic of Expo 86, dealers introduced an influx of high-purity cocaine and heroin. In efforts to clean up other areas of the city, police cracked down on the cocaine market and street prostitution, but these activities resurfaced in the DTES. Within the DTES, police officers gave up on arresting the huge numbers of individual drug users, and chose to focus their efforts on dealers instead.Meanwhile, the provincial government adopted a policy of de-institutionalization of the mentally ill, leading to the mass discharge of Riverview Hospital's patients, with the promise that they would be integrated into the community. Between 1985 and 1999, the number of patient-days of care provided by B.C. psychiatric hospitals declined by nearly 65%. Many of the de-institutionalized mentally ill moved to the DTES, attracted by the accepting culture and low-cost housing, but they floundered without adequate treatment and support and soon became addicted to the neighbourhood's readily available drugs.Between 1980 and 2002, more than 60 women went missing from the DTES, most of them sex workers. Robert Pickton, who had a farm east of the city where he held ""raves"", was charged with the murders of 26 of these women and convicted on six counts in 2007. He claimed to have murdered 49 women. As of 2009, an estimated 39 women were still missing from the Downtown Eastside.


=== 1990s to present ===
On its core blocks, dozens of people are shuffling or staggering, flinching with cocaine tics, scratching scabs. Except for the young women dressed to lure customers for sex, many are in dirt-streaked clothing that hangs from their emaciated frames. Drugs and cash are openly exchanged. The alleys are worse.

In the 1990s, the situation in the DTES deteriorated further on several fronts. Woodward's, an anchor store in the 100-block of West Hastings street, closed in 1993 with devastating effect on the formerly bustling retail district.  Meanwhile, a crisis in housing and homelessness was emerging.
Between 1970 and the late 1990s, the supply of low-income housing shrank in both the DTES and in other parts of the city, partly because of conversion of buildings into more expensive condominiums or hotels. In 1993, the federal government stopped funding social housing, and the rate of building social housing in B.C. dropped by two-thirds despite rising demand for it. By 1995, reports had begun to emerge of homeless people sleeping in parks, alleyways, and abandoned buildings. Cuts to the provincial welfare program in 2002 caused further hardship for the poor and homeless. Citywide, the number of homeless people climbed from 630 in 2002 to 1,300 in 2005.Without the presence of a viable retail economy, a drug economy proliferated, with an accompanying increase in crime, while police presence decreased. Crack cocaine arrived in Vancouver in 1995, and crystal methamphetamine started to appear in the DTES in 2003. In 1997 the local health authority declared a public health emergency in the DTES: Rates of HIV infection, spread by needle-sharing amongst drug users, were worse than anywhere in the world outside Sub-Saharan Africa, and more than 1000 people had died of drug overdoses. Efforts to reduce drug-related deaths in the DTES included the opening of a needle exchange in 1989, the opening of North America's first legal safe injection site in 2003, and treatment with anti-retroviral drugs for HIV. A shift among users from injected cocaine to crack cocaine use may have also slowed the spread of disease. Rates of HIV infection dropped from 8.1 cases per 100 person-years in 1997 to 0.37 cases per 100 person-years by 2011.

In the 21st century, considerable investment was made in DTES services and infrastructure, including the redevelopment of the Woodward's Building and the acquisition of 23 SRO hotels by the provincial government for conversion to social housing. In 2009, The Globe and Mail estimated that governments and the private sector had spent more than $1.4 billion since 2000 on projects aimed at resolving the area's many problems.Opinions vary on whether the area has improved: A 2014 article in the National Post said, ""For all the money and attention here, there is little success at either getting the area's shattered populace back on their feet, or cleaning up the neighbourhood into something resembling a healthy community."" Former NDP premier Mike Harcourt described the current reality of the neighbourhood as ""100-per-cent failure."" Also in 2014, B.C. housing minister Rich Coleman said, ""I’ll go down for a walk in the Downtown Eastside, night time or day time, and it's dramatically different than it was. It's incredibly better than it was five, six years ago.""


== Demographics ==

There are no official population figures for the DTES. Estimates have ranged from 6,000 to 8,000; the geographic boundaries associated with these figures was not provided.
Official figures are available for the greater DTES area, which was home to an estimated 18,477 people in 2011. In comparison to the city of Vancouver overall, the greater DTES had a higher proportion of males (60% vs. 50%), more seniors (22% vs 13%), fewer children and youth (10% vs 18%), slightly fewer immigrants, and more Aboriginals (10% vs. 2%).A 2009 demographic profile by The Globe and Mail focused on an area of just over 30 city blocks in and around the DTES: It indicated that 14% of the residents were of Aboriginal descent. The average household size was 1.3 residents; 82% of the population lived alone. Children and teenagers made up 7% of the population, compared to 25% for Canada overall.A population that is frequently studied is tenants of single room occupancy (SRO) hotels in the greater DTES area. According to a 2013 survey, this population is 77% male, with a median age of 44. Aboriginals make up 28% of the population, and Europeans 59%.


== Current issues ==


=== Addiction and mental illness ===

The DTES population suffers from very high rates of mental illness and addiction. In 2007, Vancouver Coastal Health estimated that 2,100 DTES residents ""exhibit behaviour that is outside the norm"" and require more support in the areas of health and addiction services. According to the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) in 2008, up to 500 of these individuals were ""chronically mentally ill with disabling addictions, extreme behaviours, no permanent housing and regular police contact."" As of 2009, the DTES was home to an estimated 1,800 to 3,600 individuals who were considered to be at ""extremely high health risk"" due to severe addiction and/or mental illness, equivalent to 60% of the population in this category for the 1 million people in the Vancouver Coastal Health region.A 2013 study of SRO tenants in the greater DTES found that 95.2% had some form of substance dependence and 74.4% had a mental illness, including 47.4% with psychosis. Only one third of individuals with psychosis were receiving treatment, and among those with concurrent addiction, the proportion receiving treatment was even lower. A 2016 study of the 323 most chronic offenders in the DTES found that 99% had at least one mental disorder, and more than 80% also had substance abuse issues. Between 60% and 70% of mentally ill patients treated at St. Paul's Hospital, the hospital closest to the DTES, are estimated to have multiple addictions. Possible explanations for the high level of co-occurrence between addiction and mental illness in the DTES include the vulnerability of the mentally ill to drug dealers, and a recent rise in crystal methamphetamine use, which can cause permanent psychosis.


==== Substance use ====

A 2010 BBC article described the DTES as ""home to one of the worst drug problems in North America."" In 2011, crack cocaine was the most commonly used illicit hard drug in Vancouver, followed by injected prescription opioids (such as fentanyl and OxyContin), heroin, crystal methamphetamine (usually injected rather than smoked), and cocaine (also usually injected). Alcoholism, especially when it involves the use of highly toxic isopropyl alcohol, is a significant source of harm to residents of the DTES.In 2016, a board member of the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users said that in the previous year, Vancouver's supply of heroin had virtually disappeared and been replaced by fentanyl, which is cheaper and more potent. At the end of 2014, the DTES saw a dramatic rise in fentanyl overdoses. In 2016 the surge in drug overdose deaths led to the declaration of a public health emergency across the province.In a 2008 survey of SRO residents in the greater DTES, 32% self-reported as being addicted to drugs, 20% were addicted to alcohol, 52% smoked cigarettes regularly, and 51% smoked marijuana. In 2003, the DTES was home to an estimated 4,700 injection drug users. Most live in unstable housing or are homeless, and approximately 20% are sex workers. In 2006, DTES residents incurred half of the deaths from illegal drug overdoses in the entire province. Between 1996 and 2011, there have been large fluctuations in drug usage, with the most recent trend being an overall decline in illicit drug use between 2007 and 2011. However, between 2010 and 2014, hospitalizations related to addictions increased by 89% at St. Paul's Hospital.According to a 2008 survey of greater DTES area SROs, tenants who used drugs estimated the cost of their habits at $30 per day, on average. Some spend hundreds of dollars per day on drugs. Police attribute much of the property crime in Vancouver to chronic repeat offenders who steal to support their drug habits.


==== Mental illness ====
The VPD reported in 2008 that in its district that includes the Downtown Eastside, mental health was a factor in 42% of all incidents in which police were involved. The police department says its officers are often forced to act as front-line mental health workers, due to the lack of more appropriate supports for this population.In 2013, the city and police department reported that in the previous three years, there had been a 43% increase in people with severe mental illness and/or addiction in the emergency department of St. Paul's Hospital. In Vancouver, apprehensions under the Mental Health Act rose by 16% between 2010 and 2012, and there was also an increase in the number of violent incidents involving mentally ill people.  Mayor Gregor Robertson described the mental health crisis as ""on par with, if not more serious than"" the DTES HIV/AIDS epidemic that had led to a declaration of a public health emergency in 1997.


=== Overdose crisis ===
The overdose deaths in BC between 2003 and 2018 are up over 725%, and overdose deaths of minors 10–18 years old are up 260% in 10 years. Fraser and Vancouver Coastal Health Authority have had the highest number of illicit drug toxicity deaths (188 and 164 deaths, respectively) in 2019, making up 65% of all such deaths during this period. 2019: Vancouver Coastal Health Authority has the highest rate of illicit drug toxicity deaths (27 deaths per 100,000 individuals).In a report presented to the City Council of Vancouver by Mayor Kennedy Stewart on 20 December 2018 regarding the Opioid Crisis, he stated, ""As of December 16, 2018, an estimated 353 overdose deaths have occurred in Vancouver in 2018, which is almost on par with the 369 overdose deaths that occurred in 2017, despite the extensive harm reduction investments in Vancouver. Vancouver continues to have the highest rates of death per capita in BC, with 58 deaths per 100,000 people this year. Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services are responding to an average of 103 overdose-related emergency calls per week, slightly down from the 2017 average of 119 calls per week. The decreased rate in overdose deaths and calls could potentially be attributed to the increase in overdose prevention and response interventions across Vancouver, with an emphasis on the Downtown Eastside.
Regardless, Vancouver continues to be the most impacted city of the overdose crisis in Canada. From January to June 2018, BC had 754 opioid-related deaths – the most in the country. Vancouver also has more overdose deaths per capita than all of BC, which had 30 deaths per 100,000 people between January and June this year."" 


=== Sex work ===

In my 12 years of work as a physician in the DTES, I never met a female patient who had not been sexually abused as a child or adolescent, nor a male who had not suffered some form of severe trauma... Addictions are attempts to escape pain.
Vancouver has an estimated 1,000 street sex workers and according to police, most of them work in the DTES. They call the neighbourhood, and contiguous industrial areas near Vancouver's port, the ""low track"", where they typically earn $5 to $20 for a date. Most are survival sex workers who use prostitution to support their drug addictions; up to two thirds say they have been physically or sexually assaulted while working. Sex workers, particularly women with children, find it difficult to find housing that they can afford, and often have difficulty leaving prostitution because of criminal records or addictions that make it harder to find jobs.Although Aboriginals make up only 2% of Vancouver's population, approximately 40% of Vancouver's street sex workers are Aboriginal. In one 2005 study, 52% of the prostitutes surveyed in Vancouver were Aboriginal, 96% reported having been sexually abused in childhood, and 81% reported childhood physical abuse. Some researchers and Aboriginal advocacy groups have attributed the over-representation of Aboriginals in Vancouver's sex trade to transgenerational trauma, linking it to Canada's colonial history, and in particular to the cultural and individual damage caused by the residential schools, which previous generations of indigenous Canadians were forced to attend.


=== Crime and public disorder ===

Reported crime rates in the DTES are higher than in the rest of the city, with most crimes being assaults, robberies, and/or public intoxication. Although the DTES is home to 3% of Vancouver's population, it was the location of 16% of the city's reported sexual assaults in 2012. In 2008, it was the location of 34.5% of all reported serious assaults and 22.6% of all robberies in the city.These figures may be an underestimate, as marginalized populations such as DTES residents tend to be less likely to report crime.   Many residents are survivors of the Canadian Indian residential school system or experience transgenerational trauma as a result of Residential Schools, and are further traumatised by excessive policing.The figures do not indicate how many of the reported crimes were committed by DTES residents; some residents and business owners believe that visitors from other neighbourhoods are responsible for a significant proportion of serious crimes.   According to police, DTES women say that what they fear most are ""predatory drug dealers who conduct their business with violence, torture, and terror.""In addition to reported crime, the DTES has highly visible street disorder, which The New York Times described as ""a shock even to someone familiar with the Lower East Side of Manhattan in the 1980s or the Tenderloin in San Francisco."" Some government social workers have refused to enter certain SROs out of concern for their own safety, despite being mandated to monitor children who live there. Tourists are often encouraged to avoid the DTES, although they are seldom victims of crime. High crime rates and difficulties in obtaining affordable property insurance deter legitimate businesses from opening or staying in the area, resulting in many vacant storefronts.


=== Poverty ===

The greater DTES area is significantly poorer than the rest of Vancouver, with a median income of $13,691 versus $47,229 for the city as a whole. 53% of the greater DTES population is low-income, compared to 13.6% of the population of Metro Vancouver. In the V6A postal area, whose boundaries are similar to the greater DTES area, 6,339 residents received some form of social assistance in 2013. Of these, 3,193 were considered disabled and 1,461 were considered ""employable"".  The base welfare rate for single adults who are considered employable is $610 per month: $375 per month for shelter and $235 ($335 since July 2017) per month for all other expenses. Advocates for low-income DTES residents say this amount, which has not increased since 2007, is not enough to live on. In 1981, the base welfare rate was equivalent to $970 per month after adjustment for inflation.Some DTES residents supplement their incomes through the informal economy, through volunteer work which can yield stipends, or through criminal activity or sex work. A 2008 survey of SRO residents found that the average tenant income from all sources, including the informal economy, was $1,109 per month.In addition to issues with addiction and mental illness, DTES residents often have difficulty finding employment due to mental and physical disabilities and lack of education and skills. According to a 2009 survey of the 30 blocks in and around the DTES, 62% of the residents over the age of 15 were not considered participants in the labour force, compared to 33% in Vancouver as a whole.The DTES is often referred to as ""Canada's poorest postal code"", although this is not the case.


=== Housing ===

Both homelessness and substandard housing are major issues in the DTES, that compound the neighbourhood's problems with addiction and mental illness. In 2012, there were 846 homeless people in the greater DTES area, including 171 who were not in some form of shelter. The DTES homeless made up approximately half of the city's total homeless population, over a third of whom are Aboriginal.Thousands of DTES residents live in SROs, which provide low-cost rooms without private kitchens or bathrooms,  Although conditions in SROs vary considerably, they have become notorious for their squalor and chaos. Many are more than 100 years old and in extreme disrepair, with shortages of basic necessities such as heat and functioning plumbing. In 2007, it was reported that four out of five rooms had bed bugs, cockroaches, and fire code violations. Even at their best, the SROS have a lack of living space that results in tenants spending more time in the public spaces of the DTES, including its street-based drug scene.SRO landlords have often been called ""slumlords"" for failing to fix problems, and illegally evicting tenants. The city has often been slow to force SRO owners to make major repairs, saying that owners could not afford to make them without raising rents.


=== Health and well-being ===

A 2013 study of SRO residents in the greater DTES area found that 18.4% were HIV positive and 70.3% were positive for hepatitis C. Few of those infected with hepatitis C receive treatment. The DTES population also has higher rates of tuberculosis and syphilis than the rest of the province, and injection drug users are susceptible to other infections such as endocarditis.  Aboriginals are at the greatest risk from disease.Amongst the most vulnerable DTES residents, common issues with psychosocial well-being include low self-worth, lack of personal safety, lack of respect from others, social isolation, and low education levels. Many have lost custody of their children. A 2000 report from the Vancouver Native Health Society Medical Clinic said, ""Many individuals are survivors of severe childhood trauma. Negative experiences such as family violence, parental substance abuse, sexual and emotional abuse, suicide, divorce, and residential school atrocities are the norm."" Many DTES residents are too unstable to keep appointments or reliably take medication.Life expectancy in the greater DTES area is 79.9 years, a significant improvement since the mid-1990s. Some of the increase may, however, be explained by the migration of healthier residents to the neighbourhoods surrounding the DTES. A 2015 study of DTES SRO residents found that they were eight times more likely to die than the national average, mostly due to psychosis and hepatitis C-related liver dysfunction.


== Culture ==

Although many outsiders fear the DTES, its residents take pride in their neighbourhood and describe it as having multiple positive assets. DTES residents say the area has a strong sense of community and cultural heritage. They describe their neighbours as being accepting and having empathy for people with addictions and health issues. According to the City, Hastings Street is valued by SRO residents as ""a place to meet friends, get support, access services and feel like they belong.""The area has had a robust tradition of advocacy for its marginalized residents since at least the 1970s, when the Downtown Eastside Residents Association (DERA) was formed. Over the years, the DTES community has consistently resisted many attempts to ""clean up"" the neighbourhood by dispersing its close-knit residents. Successful resident-led initiatives to improve conditions in the DTES include the transformation of the then-closed Carnegie Library into a community centre in 1980, the opening of an unlicensed supervised injection site in 2003, which led to the founding of Insite; improvements to Oppenheimer Park, and the creation of CRAB Park.
In 2010, the V6A postal area, which includes most of the DTES, had the second-highest concentration of artists in the city. Artists made up 4.4% of the labour force, compared to 2.3% in the city as a whole. The greater DTES area is the location of several art galleries, artist-run centres and studios. Notable annual events include the Downtown Eastside Heart of the City Festival, which showcases the art, culture, and history of the neighbourhood, and the Powell Street Festival in Oppenheimer Park, which celebrates Japanese-Canadian arts and culture. City Opera of Vancouver, the Dancing on the Edge Festival, and other artists regularly perform in DTES venues such as the Carnegie Centre, the Firehall Arts Centre, and the Goldcorp Centre for the Arts at the Woodward's site. In 2010, Sam Sullivan, former mayor of Vancouver, said that in the DTES, ""Behind the visible people who clearly have a lot of troubles, there's a community. Some very intelligent people say this is the cultural heart of the city.""


== Law enforcement ==
For the police, success is measured in how well the drugs are kept corralled on Hastings between Cambie and Main, where they can expect the fewest complaints. Arrests are infrequent, and when they occur they are counterproductive... Like a hydra, direct enforcement paradoxically crowds the streets with the incarcerated dealers multiplying replacements.
  
In comparison to other Canadian cities, the VPD is generally considered to be progressive in dealing with drugs and sex work, emphasizing harm reduction over law enforcement. 
The VPD engages in the controversial practice known as ""carding"", or ""street checks"", in which police stop and question individuals whom they suspect of being involved in criminal or suspicious activity. In Vancouver, 15% of street checks are on Indigenous people who represent just 2% of the general population, and 5% of checks are on Black people who represent less than 1% of the population. Some civil rights groups believe the VPD's practices constitute racial profiling and result in excessive harassment and violence against Indigenous and Black residents.Since the 1980s, the VPD has generally ignored drug use in the DTES, as the sheer volume of users makes it unfeasible to arrest all of them. A large-scale police crackdown on DTES drug users in 2003 made no difference except to displace drug use to adjacent neighbourhoods. To encourage people to call for help when a drug user is overdosing, paramedics rather than police respond to 911 calls about overdose deaths, except in cases where public safety is at risk.Nationwide efforts to reduce the supply of drugs through law enforcement have had minimal impact on the easy availability or low prices of illicit drugs in Vancouver. By former mayor Mike Harcourt's estimate, police intercept only 2% of the drugs that enter the city. Vancouver police guidelines on dealing with sex workers emphasize focusing on addressing violence, human trafficking, and involvement of youth or gangs in prostitution, whereas sex involving consenting adults is not an enforcement priority.Relations between police and DTES women were strained by police shortcomings that allowed serial killer Robert Pickton to prey on the community for years before he was arrested in 2002; the VPD apologized in 2010 for its failures in apprehending him. In 2003, the Pivot Legal Society filed 50 complaints from DTES residents alleging police misconduct. An investigation by the RCMP, in which several VPD officers and the police chief failed to co-operate, found that 14 of those allegations were substantiated. In 2007, Pivot agreed to withdraw its remaining complaints, following apologies and changes to VPD policies and procedures.In 2008, the VPD implemented a crackdown on minor offences, such as illegal vending on sidewalks and jaywalking. The ticketing blitz was stopped after objections from community groups, so that residents with unpaid tickets – particularly women and sex workers – would be less afraid to approach police to report serious safety concerns.In 2010, police launched an initiative to combat violence against DTES women, that resulted in the convictions of several violent offenders. However, the level of trust toward police remains low. According to some DTES activists, ""gentrification/condos and police brutality"", rather than drugs, are the two worst problems in the neighbourhood.


== Housing availability and affordability ==
Any discussion of improving the continuum of care for addiction must include housing as a basic component, particularly for the most vulnerable individuals coping with homelessness, addiction, and mental illness.
The City refers to the housing and homelessness situation in the DTES as a ""crisis"". There is wide support amongst governments, experts, and community groups on a Housing First model, which prioritizes stable, quality housing as a precursor to other interventions for the homeless, those who use drugs, or those with mental illness. Many people with severe addiction and/or mental illness require supportive housing.As the DTES has many low-income adults who live alone and are at risk of homelessness, trends in housing options for low-income adults are of central importance to the neighbourhood. Although SROs have well-known problems, each SRO resident who loses their room and ends up on the street is estimated to cost the provincial government approximately $30,000 to $40,000 per year in additional services.

In recent years, the number of units designed for low-income singles has increased slightly: In the downtown area (Burrard Street to Clark Drive) there were 11,371 units in 1993 and 12,126 units in 2013. The number of privately owned SROs declined during this time by 3283 units, while the number of social housing units increased by 4038 units. In 2014, an additional 300 privately owned SRO units were lost.However, rents in many of those units have risen. Rents in social housing units for low-income singles are fixed at the shelter component of welfare rates, but rents in privately owned SROs can vary. In 2013, 24% of privately owned SROs rented at the base welfare shelter rate of $375 per month, down from 60% in 2007.  According to one advocacy group, the average lowest rent in privately owned hotels in the greater DTES area was $517 per month in 2015, and there were no vacant rooms renting at less than $425 per month.The city has implemented a bylaw to discourage the redevelopment of SROs. Advocates for SRO tenants argue that the city's bylaw does not go far enough, as it does not prevent rent increases. The city says that only the province, not the city, has the jurisdiction to control rents, and that the province should raise welfare rates.Since 2007, the provincial government has acquired 23 privately owned SRO hotels in the greater DTES area, containing 1,500 units. It undertook extensive renovations in 13 of those buildings at a cost of $143.3 million, of which $29.1 million was paid by the federal government. Due to rising rents and often-decrepit conditions in the area's remaining 4,484 privately owned SROs, DTES activists have called for governments to replace them with a further 5,000 social housing units for low-income singles.


== Migration patterns ==
The DTES has a history of attracting migrants with mental health and addiction issues from across B.C. and Canada, with many drawn by its drug market, affordable housing, and services. Between 1991 and 2007, the DTES population increased by 140%.A 2016 study found that 52% of those DTES residents who experience chronic homelessness and serious mental-health issues, had migrated from outside Vancouver in the previous 10 years. This proportion of the population has tripled in the last decade. The same study found that once migrants had settled in the DTES, their conditions worsened. A 2013 study of tenants of DTES SROs found that while 93% of those surveyed were born in Canada, only 13% were born in Vancouver. Vancouver Coastal Health estimates that half of the population that uses its health services in the DTES are long-term residents, and that there is a population turnover of 15 to 20% each year.


== Concentration of services controversy ==
You just keep dumping money in, building social housing and filling it up with people from all around the region and the country ... they all get chemically dependent, and it's just more sales for the drug dealers.
The Downtown Eastside, really, has become the last place where everybody runs to from across Canada. It's the last, best place for people who are the most marginalized people in the country.
It's the NIMBYism of the other 23 communities in the city that is the Downtown Eastside's greatest problem. And what the city needs to do is work to put significantly more services in different communities.
The DTES is the site of many service offerings including social housing, health care, free meals and clothing, harm reduction for drug users, housing assistance, employment preparation, adult education, children's programs, emergency housing, arts and recreation, and legal advocacy.  In 2014, the Vancouver Sun reported that there were 260 social services and housing sites in the greater DTES area, spending $360 million per year. No other Canadian city has concentrated services to this degree in one small area.Proponents of the high level of services say that it is necessary to meet the complex needs of the DTES population. For some residents, the sense of community and acceptance that they find in the DTES makes it a unique place of healing for them.The practice of locating a large number of services in the DTES has also been criticized for attracting vulnerable people to an area where drugs, crime, and disorder are entrenched. Some advocates for vulnerable populations believe that many DTES residents would have a better quality of life and improved chances of health if they could separate from the neighbourhood's predatory drug pushers and pimps.During the City's 2014 planning process for the greater DTES, two-thirds of those who participated said they wanted to stay in the area. But a 2008 survey of SRO tenants had indicated that 70% wanted to leave the DTES. The City's 30-year plan is for two-thirds of the city's future social housing to be located in the greater DTES area.


=== Views on services in other neighbourhoods ===
Vancouver Coastal Health says that the lack of appropriate care for complex social and health issues outside of the DTES often does not allow people ""the choice to remain in their home community where their natural support systems exist... A common barrier that prevents mentally ill and addicted people from living outside of the DTES is a lack of appropriate services and supports, and too often clients who do secure housing outside the neighbourhood return to the DTES regularly because of the lack of supports found in other communities.""Proposals to add social housing and services for those with addiction and/or mental health issues to other Metro Vancouver neighborhoods are often met with Nimbyism, even when residents selected for such projects would be low-risk individuals. A 2012 poll of Metro Vancouver residents found that although nine out of 10 of those surveyed wanted the homeless to have access to services they need, 54% believed that ""housing in their community should be there for the people who can afford it."" Some commentators have suggested that Vancouver residents tacitly agree to have the DTES act as a de facto ghetto for the most troubled individuals in the city.


== Gentrification controversy ==
This community could be wiped off the face of the map. In the last three or four years the character of the neighbourhood has totally changed. Basically affordable rentals are a thing of the past.
Years of experience in other urban centres make it clear that maintaining the DTES as a high or special needs social housing enclave, over the long term will not help to stabilize either the community or the city as a whole.

The DTES lies a few blocks east of the most expensive commercial real estate in the city. Since the mid-2000s, new development in the DTES has brought a mixture of market-rate housing (primarily condominiums), social housing, office spaces, restaurants, and shops. Property values in the DTES area increased by 303% between 2001 and 2013.  Prices at the newer retail establishments are often far higher than low-income residents can afford.The city promotes mixed-income housing, and requires new large housing developments in the DTES to set aside 20% of their units for social housing. As of 2014, in a section of Hastings Street from Carrall Street to Heatley Avenue, at least 60% of units must be dedicated to social housing and the rest must be rental units. Rents in at least one-third of new social housing units are not permitted to exceed the shelter component of welfare rates.Proponents say that new developments revitalize the area, improve the quality of life, provide new social housing, and encourage a stronger retail environment and a stabilizing street presence. They emphasize that their goal is for the DTES to include a mixture of income levels and avoid the problems associated with concentrated poverty, not to become an expensive yuppie-oriented neighbourhood like nearby Yaletown.Others oppose the addition of market housing and upscale businesses to the DTES, in the belief that these changes will drive up prices, displace low-income residents, and make poor people feel less at home. Protests against new businesses and housing developments have occasionally turned violent.


== Costs ==

Several overlapping sets of data exist on costs related to the DTES:

DTES-specific costs: Of the estimated $360 million per year to operate 260 social services and housing sites in the greater DTES area, three quarters of the spending is funded by governments, and the rest by private donors. This figure includes operating costs of a range of organizations including neighbourhood health care services, but does not include standard city operations, the capital costs of building social housing or other infrastructure, or hospital costs.
Wider-area costs related to issues that are concentrated in the DTES: In the closest hospital to the DTES, Saint Paul's, injection drug use leads to approximately 15% of admissions. The annual cost of ambulances responding to overdoses in Vancouver is $500,000, and the cost of police response to calls involving mental health problems is estimated to be $9 million per year.
Costs per individual: For each untreated drug addict, the costs to society, including crime, judicial costs, and health care, are estimated to be at least $45,000 per year. The government-paid lifetime healthcare cost per HIV-infected injection drug user is estimated at $150,000. A 2008 study estimated that each homeless person in B.C. costs $55,000 per year in government-paid costs related to healthcare, corrections, and social services, whereas providing housing and support would cost $37,000 per year. Costs per individual vary widely: A 2016 study found that 107 chronic offenders in the DTES incur public service costs of $247,000 per person per year.


== Housing strategies ==

Although housing and homelessness are often perceived as being municipal issues, social housing is traditionally funded primarily by senior levels of government, which receive 92% of tax revenue in Canada. Libby Davies, a former DTES activist and Member of Parliament, called for a National Housing Strategy in 2009, saying that Canada is the world's only industrialized country with no national housing plan.In 2014, the City of Vancouver approved a 30-year plan for the greater DTES area. It sets out a goal of having 4,400 units of social housing added to the greater DTES area, 3,350 units of social housing added elsewhere in the city, and 1,900 units of new supportive housing scattered throughout the city. The cost of implementing the plan is estimated at $1 billion, of which  $220-million would be paid by the city, $300-million by developers, and more than $500-million from the provincial and/or national governments.  The provincial government, which recently invested $300 million in social housing in Vancouver, said that it will not be funding the proposed housing expansion, and that its housing strategy had shifted towards other models such as rent assistance rather than construction.


== Addiction and mental illness strategies ==
In 2001, the city adopted a ""Four Pillars"" drug strategy consisting of four equally important ""pillars"": prevention, treatment, enforcement, and harm reduction. Advocates of the Four Pillars strategy say that the 36 recommendations associated with the policy have only been partly implemented, with prevention, treatment, and harm reduction all being underfunded. Across Canada, 94% of drug strategy dollars are spent on enforcement. The city's 2014 Local Area Plan for the DTES does not propose solutions to the neighbourhood's drug problems; an article in the National Post described it as a ""221-page document that expertly skirted around any mention of the Downtown Eastside as a failed community in need of a drastic turnaround.""The VPD, B.C. Medical Association, and City of Vancouver have asked the province to urgently increase capacity for treating addiction and mental illness.  In 2009, the BCMA asked that detoxification be available on demand, with no waiting period, by 2012.  A 2016 study of youth who used illicit drugs in Vancouver indicated that 28% had tried unsuccessfully to access addiction treatment in the previous 6 months, with the lack of success mostly due to being placed on waiting lists.After the city and police department described an emerging mental health crisis in Vancouver in 2013, the province implemented three of their five recommendations within a year, including new Assertive Community Treatment teams and a nine-bed urgent care facility at St. Paul's Hospital. In response to a recommendation that the province add 300 new long-term health care beds for the most severely mentally ill, provincial Health Minister Terry Lake said that more research was needed to determine whether these beds were urgently needed. As of 2015, the province had opened or committed to only 50 new beds.


== Co-ordination of services ==
Although DTES residents often have a complex combination of needs, services are typically delivered from the perspective of a single discipline (such as police or medical), or a particular agency's mandate, with little communication between the service providers who are working with a given individual. Despite widespread agreement in principle that a co-ordinated approach is necessary to improve conditions for DTES residents, the three levels of government have not agreed on any overall long-term plan for the DTES, and there is no overall co-ordination of services for the area.In 2009, the VPD proposed the creation of a steering committee made up of senior city and provincial stakeholders, which would be mandated to improve collaboration between service providers to enable a client-centric rather than discipline-centric model. The report recommends prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable individuals in the neighbourhood, saying that having them get the assistance they require is ""a necessary condition for other neighbourhood improvement initiatives to succeed.""

159,Anti-Oriental riots (Vancouver),"The Vancouver riots occurred September 7–9, 1907, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  At about the same time there were similar anti-Asian riots in San Francisco, Bellingham, Washington, and other West Coast cities. They were not coordinated, but instead reflected common underlying anti-immigration attitudes. Agitation for direct action was led by labour unions and small business. No one was killed but the damage to Asian-owned property was extensive. One result was an informal agreement whereby the government of China stopped emigration to Canada.


== Causes of riots ==
In the early years of the twentieth century race relations on the Pacific Coast of Canada were strained. There were an estimated 16,000 Chinese immigrants in the province at the 1901 census, a sharp increase from the prior 1881 (4,350) and 1891 (8,910) counts. There were also 8,000 Japanese and around 5,000 South Asians. The Chinese had come to Canada to build the railways; the Japanese to fish; and Indians to farm and log.

At this time, other ships with more migrants were arriving, including the Suian Maru [83 Japanese, 1906], SS Kumeric [1,177 Japanese, 1907], SS Tartar [514 Indians, 1907], and the SS Monteagle [901 Indians, further 100 in 1908]. Meanwhile, the Panic of 1907, caused by the failure of Augustus Heinze's brother's bank in New York, exacerbated the difficult labour market and brought racial tensions to the fore.
White people perceived Asians as taking ""their"" jobs. Australia had enacted the Immigration Restriction Act 1901 which promulgated the White Australia policy and eliminated Asian immigration shortly after confederation. The Asian Exclusion League in Canada lobbied for Canada to do the same.
The riots that broke out on September 7 of 1907 were the accumulation of growing enmity toward the Asian immigrants that were coming to the United States and parts of Canada. ""By the end of October 1907, new arrivals totaled 11,440. Of these immigrants the Japanese accounted for 8,125, the Chinese 1,266, and the Punjabi Sikhs 2,049"". As the numbers of Asian immigrants continued to grow, anti-Asian activist began to feel threatened that the Japanese could ""ultimately control [Vancouver] part of Canada"". The riots represented the voices and feelings of anti-Asian activists, in attempt to ""convince federal authorities of the seriousness of anti-Japanese sentiment in British Columbia"".


== Events ==
The 1907 Vancouver riot was the second act of anti-Asian violence in the history of Vancouver; the first incident took place in the area of Coal Harbour, in 1887. A riot targeting East Indian lumber workers in Bellingham in 1907 started the events. Shortly thereafter, tensions flared in the north and angry mobs stormed through Powell Street in Vancouver's Chinatown, breaking windows and assaulting Chinese people in the streets.  The riot lasted three days in September 1907; finally the Vancouver police closed the streets and calm slowly returned. Many windows were broken and the population was terrified.  The second day of the riot turned against the Japanese community. There were similar actions in Steveston in Richmond against the Japanese.


=== Immediate lead-up ===
Early in 1907 the Grand Trunk and Pacific Railway lobbied Ottawa to let it import 10,000 Japanese workers to build its line in Northern BC [this figure is often misquoted as 50,000].  Premier Bowser did not like such large numbers and opposed such a large Asian influx. On August 12, 1907, members of the Asiatic Exclusion League met and developed a resolution. The document asked the Canadian government to ""enforce the Immigration Act passed by the provincial legislature in the Spring of 1907"", but the Canadian Government refused to endorse the proposed act.
At about the same time there were similar anti-Asian riots in San Francisco, Bellingham, Washington, and other West Coast cities. They were not coordinated, but instead reflected common underlying anti-Asian nativism.  The Vancouver riots were a direct result of the race riot in Bellingham, Washington, on September 5, 1907. Many Chinese victims of the Bellingham race riots fled for Canada, subsequently fuelling the Asiatic Exclusion League of Vancouver to take a stance against anti-Asian immigration.


=== Parade and riot ===
At the third meeting, the member of the Asiatic Exclusion League decided to plan a parade for Saturday the 7th of September, which would include a band in order to draw attention. The parade would lead to Vancouver City Hall at Hastings and Main (then named Westminster), next to Chinatown, where a rally would be held to address the issues of Asian Immigration. 10,000 Canadian and American citizens marched in that anti-Asian immigration parade, which resulted in a mob rioting throughout Chinese and Japanese neighbourhoods within Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

As various speakers were discussing the Bellingham riot, the sound of shattering glass caused by a rock tossed by an unruly teen, had sounded the beginning of what would become a much larger riot in Vancouver. The crowd gathered at the parade turned into a rioting mob, throwing beer bottles and rocks at windows, attempting to destroy Chinese owned stores and homes. Most of the buildings attacked during the Vancouver riots were Caucasian owned.The mob of rioters moved to Japantown after destroying Chinese business and homes, however, the riots were pushed back by Japanese residents. The Vancouver riot was not finished until 3 o'clock in the morning on September 8, by the time dawn had broken the city was quiet. The Vancouver race riot resulted in zero casualties and a couple thousand dollars worth of property damages.


== Aftermath ==
Labour Minister MacKenzie King was detailed to write a Royal Commission into the events. He also recompensed the damage with $36,000 to the injured communities.The Vancouver race riot resulted in bans on immigration for Japanese people. This ban was titled the gentlemen's agreement and was enacted in Canada on January 25, 1908. Within this treaty Japan agreed to ""restrict the number of passports issued to make labourers and domestic servants to an annual maximum of 400"". In addition to the Gentlemen's agreement, Canada also passed the ""Continuous journey"" legislation, which allowed Japanese immigrant to ""finish"" their journey to the United States.Although spared the worst of the riots by remaining indoors, the aftermath nevertheless affected Indians living in the province. In 1908 the British Columbia government passed a law preventing South Asian men from voting. Because eligibility for federal elections originated from provincial voting lists, they were also unable to vote in federal elections. The Canadian government also enacted a $200 head tax on Indian immigration and required immigrants to take a continuous journey from their country of origin to Canada; there were no boats which sailed directly from India to Canada. After 1908, yearly South Asian immigration to Canada did not exceed 80 until the 1940s. A direct result of these restrictions set the stage for one of the most infamous events in Vancouver history, the Komagata Maru Incident in 1914.

160,Trans Am Totem,"Trans Am Totem is a public art installation in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, created by sculptor Marcus Bowcott. Part of the Vancouver Biennale, the piece was unveiled in April 2015.  Located at the intersection of  Quebec Street and Milross Avenue, near False Creek, east of Vancouver's Downtown area, the sculpture incorporates stacked cars on top of a base made from a tree trunk. It stands 10 metres (33 ft) high and weighs 11,340 kilograms (25,000 lb).


== Background ==
Bowcott's fascination with crumbling cars started when working on tow boats on the Fraser River in the 1980s. Farmers used cars as breakwaters to stop the river banks from eroding, leaving the cars in various states of ruin. Bowcott attempted to record his impressions of the decayed vehicles in paintings, but was dissatisfied with the results. After teaching at Capilano University for 22 years, Bowcott started working on the Trans Am Totem project for the 2014–2016 Vancouver Biennale.Construction of the stack of automobiles took two years, with the assistance of Bowcott's partner Helene Aspinall and structural engineer Eric Karsh.  The Vancouver Biennale supplied 10,000 CAD of the construction and installation costs; the remainder were put up by the artist. After installing the sculpture, Bowcott launched a crowdfunding campaign that recouped 6,500 CAD of the installation costs.  Bowcott has stated that the piece is a ""sculptural response"" to the urban site. It is as much a ""celebration"" of our mobility and technology as it is a critique of ""throwaway consumer culture"".


== Materials ==

The sculpture incorporates five vehicles atop a wood base, made from a single tree. The vehicles are (from top to bottom) a Pontiac Trans Am, a BMW 7 Series, a Honda Civic, a Volkswagen Golf Mk1 Cabriolet, and a Mercedes-Benz.  The vehicles, donated by a local scrapyard, had their engines, transmissions and drivetrains removed to reduce their weight. A solar-powered electrical system was installed to power the vehicles' headlights and taillights.  The cars are fixed to a steel column which rises through the centre of the sculpture.  Bowcott also repainted the vehicles.  The wooden base which supports the cars is from the stump of an old-growth cedar tree, which was transported from southern Vancouver Island. The tree was separated into halves along its length to incorporate the central steel column.

161,Vancouver Police Museum,"The Vancouver Police Museum (formerly Vancouver Police Centennial Museum) opened to commemorate the centennial of the Vancouver Police Department and the City of Vancouver, British Columbia in 1986. Located at 240 E. Cordova Street in Vancouver's Gastown, the museum is housed in a building that was once both the Coroner’s Court and autopsy facilities (until 1980) and the City Analyst’s laboratory (until 1996). In 1935, the Coroner's Court was used as a makeshift hospital by police during the Battle of Ballantyne Pier. It was designed by architect Arthur J. Bird, and today it is a municipally designated heritage building.
The museum is run by the Vancouver Police Historical Society, a non-profit organization established in 1983 with the mandate to foster interest in the history of the Vancouver Police Department and to open a museum for this purpose. The catalyst for the project was the museum's first curator, Joe Swan, a former police sergeant and amateur historian. Swan wrote the department's official history book, which was published by the Vancouver Historical Society in 1986, entitled, A Century of Service: The Vancouver Police, 1886-1986.
The museum houses a collection of approximately 20,000 objects. This includes archival documents, photographs, publications, confiscated firearms and other weapons, counterfeit currency, and various other artifacts and memorabilia, of which an estimated 40% is on display. The museum offers educational programs for children and walking tours of the neighbourhood on the theme, ""Sins of the City."" The museum has a gift shop and publishes a quarterly newsletter.
The museum is self-funded through admission and program fees, membership fees, donations, gift shop sales, and project grants; the museum receives no direct funding from the Vancouver Police Department or the City of Vancouver but does receive in-kind support.

162,"Chinatown, Vancouver","Chinatown in Vancouver, British Columbia, is Canada's largest Chinatown. Centred on Pender Street, it is surrounded by Gastown and the Downtown financial and central business districts to the west, the Downtown Eastside to the north, the remnant of old Japantown to the northeast, and the residential neighbourhood of Strathcona to the east.
Chinatown remains a popular tourist attraction and is one of the largest historic Chinatowns in North America. However, it experienced decline as newer members of Vancouver's Cantonese Chinese community dispersed to other parts of the metropolitan area.
Due to the large ethnic Chinese presence in Vancouver—especially represented by multi-generation Chinese Canadians and first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong—the city has been referred to as ""Hongcouver"". However, in recent years, most immigration has been from Mainland China.


== Geography ==
The approximate borders of Chinatown as designated by the City of Vancouver are the alley between Pender and Hastings Streets, Georgia Street, Gore Avenue, and Taylor Street, although unofficially the area extends well into the rest of the Downtown Eastside. Main, Pender, and Keefer Streets are the principal areas of commercial activity.


=== Golden Village ===
It has been more recently overshadowed by the newer Chinese immigrant business district along No. 3 Road in the City of Richmond, south of Vancouver. Many affluent Hong Kong and Taiwanese immigrants have moved there since the late 1980s, coinciding with the increase of Chinese ethnic retail and restaurants in that area. This new area is designated the ""Golden Village"" by the City of Richmond. The proposed renaming of the area to ""Chinatown"" met resistance both from merchants in Vancouver's Chinatown and from non-Chinese residents and merchants in Richmond itself.


== History ==


=== Early immigration and head tax ===

Chinese immigrants, primarily men, first came to Vancouver in large numbers during the late 19th century, attracted in part by the British Columbia gold rush of 1858 and then the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s. In the census of 1880–81, the total Chinese population in Canada was 4,383, of which the overwhelming majority (4,350) resided in British Columbia. By 1884, 17,000 Chinese immigrants had arrived in Canada to work on the railroad alone. The 1891 census counted 9,129 Chinese in Canada (8,910 in British Columbia), and the population at the 1901 census had increased to 16,792 in Canada (14,376 in British Columbia as an incomplete count). Of the estimated 16,000 Chinese immigrants in British Columbia in 1901, 2,715 lived in Victoria and another 2,011 lived in Vancouver.After the completion of the railroad, under the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885, a head tax of CA$50 per person was levied solely on Chinese immigrants to discourage further settlement; the head tax was raised to $100 in 1900 and then $500 in 1903. 
By 1900, Chinatown covered the four square blocks bounded by Canton Alley (on the west), Hastings Street (on the north), Keefer Street (on the south), and Main Street (on the east, named Westminster Avenue at the time), with Pender Street (then called Dupont) as the main commercial district. In 1896, the health officer for the City of Vancouver reported the city had to destroy houses in Chinatown ""owing to their filthy condition"" and that ""one could hardly pass through the [Chinatown] quarter without holding one's nose."" Another health officer noted ""The Chinese merchants and employers of labour endeavour to assist the health officials, and are, as a rule, willing to co-operate and help in this matter, but the lower classes of Chinese emigrants give a great deal of trouble unless constantly watched,"" concluding that continued immigration would lead to ""circumstances and conditions which predispose to infectious disease, and serve to spread it rapidly when once it is roused into activity.""


=== Clan societies and 1907 riot ===

As more people of Chinese heritage came to Vancouver, clan associations were formed to help the newcomers assimilate in their adopted homeland and to provide friendship and support. Clan societies were often formed around a shared surname lineage, county (e.g., Kaiping, Zhongshan), or other feature of identity.The Vancouver riots of September 1907 grew out of an anti-immigration rally being held by the Asiatic Exclusion League, resulting in significant damage to Chinatown businesses. 2,000 Chinese immigrants were displaced from their homes, and total property damage resulting from the actions of the mob of 10,000 was estimated at $15,000. One news report speculated the riot was held to intimidate a visiting Japanese delegate. Another blamed the presence of American agitators. Mackenzie King, then the Deputy Minister of Labour, was dispatched to investigate the riot and recommended the disbursement of $36,000 in compensation.The head tax was repealed via the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923, which instead abolished Chinese immigration to Canada entirely, except in limited circumstances.


=== Late 20th century improvements ===
In 1979, the Chinatown Historic Area Planning Committee sponsored a streetscape improvement program to add various Chinese-style elements to the area, such as specially paved sidewalks and red dragon streetlamps that demarcated the area's borders while emphasizing it as a destination for heritage tourism. Starting with its designation by the province as a historic area in 1971 and subsequent economic shifts, Chinatown shifted from a central business district to playing a largely cultural role. Murality, a local non-profit, is installing a mural on East Pender Street with the aim of bringing colour and vitality to the neighbourhood.
The growth of Chinatown during much of the 20th century created a healthy, robust community that gradually became an aging one as many Chinese immigrants no longer lived nearby. Noticing local businesses suffering, the Chinatown Merchants Association cited the lack of parking and restrictive heritage district rules as impediments to new uses and renovations. Their concerns subsequently led to a relaxation of zoning laws to allow for a wider range of uses, including necessary demolition. Additions in the mid-1990s included a large parkade, a shopping mall, and the largest Chinese restaurant in Canada. More residential projects around the community and a lowering of property taxes helped to maintain a more rounded community. Reinvigoration was a discussed topic along government members, symbolically embedded in the Millennium Gate project, which opened in 2002. It can be argued that the role of the early Chinese settlers in Vancouver's Chinatown area in the late 19th and early 20th centuries helped to put Vancouver on the global map as a popular destination for Asian investment and immigration.


=== Recent immigration ===

In addition to Han Chinese from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Mainland China, Chinese Latin Americans have also settled in the Chinatown area. Most of them were from Peru and arrived shortly after Juan Velasco Alvarado took over that country in a military coup in 1968. Others have come from Brazil, Mexico, and Nicaragua.
Vancouver experienced large numbers of immigrants from the Asia-Pacific region in the last two decades of the twentieth century, most notably from China, whose population in the Vancouver Census Metropolitan Area was estimated at 300,000 in the mid-1990s. A significant development since the 1980s has been the increase of transnational awareness among the Chinese. The heightened mobility of capital, information, people, and commodities across territorial boundaries and distance challenged the traditional meaning of migration.
Compared to Chinatown itself, more Chinese immigrants have settled in Richmond, drawn by its lower house prices, considerable concentration of Chinese retailers, and the nearby Vancouver airport. The business heart of Chinatown was visibly affected after the arrival of suburban Asian shopping districts, such as Richmond's Aberdeen Centre, which was promoted as North America's largest enclosed Asian mall, was near other Chinese shopping centres, and which offered more parking and open space than historic Chinatown.


== Businesses and development ==
Chinatown is becoming more prosperous as new investment and old traditional businesses flourish. Today the neighbourhood features many traditional restaurants, banks, markets, clinics, tea shops, clothing stores, and other shops catering to the local community and tourists alike. The Vancouver office of Sing Tao Daily, one of the city's four Chinese-language dailies, remains in Chinatown. OMNI British Columbia (formerly Channel M) had its television studio in Chinatown from 2003 to 2010. Vancouver Film School also has a satellite location in Chinatown. The renowned bar & nightclub known as ‘Fortune Sound Club’ is situated within the heart of Chinatown (formerly Ming’s Restaurant). As of 2019, they have grown to become one of the most popular night clubs in all of BC, rivalling off the Granville Entertainment District and bringing in world-class musicians.
Chinatown's businesses today predominantly consist of those selling lower-order, working-class goods, such as groceries, tea shops, and souvenir stores. While some businesses, such as restaurants, stand out, they are no longer the only Chinese food establishments in the city, a shift that contributed to a visible decline in foot traffic and nighttime activity in Chinatown. As the vacancy rate in Chinatown currently stands at 10%, it has been acknowledged that Chinatown needs a new approach to development, since some businesses have relocated to suburban shopping centres while others simply retired or went out of business. Examples include the closing of some restaurants and shops, sometimes in instances where the family did not have successors or where the business could not sustain itself any longer. Although there is a considerable business vacancy, Chinatown lease rates are considered the cheapest in the city, at $15–$30 per square foot—about one-tenth of the asking price on Vancouver's Downtown Robson Street, the city's upscale shopping district.
The new Chinatown business plan encourages new entrepreneurs to move in—and has attracted a longboard store and German sausage shop—as ways of restoring storefronts and bringing in a younger crowd, and to make higher-income people more comfortable in the area. Attracted to the lower rent and the building's heritage status, younger businesses have moved in, often with white owners who also live in apartments above the shops. The general consensus is that Chinatown's priority is to attract people of all backgrounds to Chinatown, and it is believed that the opening of non-traditional stores will bring a new flow of energy and income to the streets. As a result, the commercial activity is becoming more diversified, dotted with Western chain stores such as Waves Coffeeshop and Dollar Giant. Other additions include vintage stores, two art galleries, bars, and a nightclub, built on the site of the former Ming's restaurant, in an attempt to bring something of a nightlife atmosphere, reminiscent of the 1950s and 1960s, back to the neighbourhood. The diversity of new shops and businesses is believed to be necessary in creating a new image for Chinatown in order to bring vibrancy back to the area and encourage commercial activities in general, and as a way to compete with suburban districts as well as nearby Gastown and Downtown Vancouver.


=== Chinatown Revitalization Action Plan ===
The Chinatown Historic Area planning committee, along with AECOM Economics, a US-based planning firm, helped to prepare a Chinatown Revitalization Action Plan for Vancouver's planning department in November 2011. Vancouver planners surveyed 77 businesses and found that 64% reported a decrease in revenue between 2008 and 2011. The majority of consumers, 58%, were local residents, with 21% coming from elsewhere in the Lower Mainland. Tourist spending accounted for only 12% of Chinatown customers. Recognizing the shifting role of Chinatown, the report highlighted key points to help the district keep up with the times:

Although Chinatown experienced rapid residential growth, Vancouver's Chinese population is no longer concentrated in the Chinatown area, as new immigration settlement is dispersed throughout Metro Vancouver, especially in Richmond.
Historically, Chinese immigrants to Vancouver were predominantly from Southern China, while immigrants today come from throughout China and Asia. Therefore, Chinatown restaurants need to broaden their offerings beyond mostly Cantonese dishes to cuisine from other parts of China and Asia in order to serve a more diversified consumer base.Building on these points, the report recommended that Chinatown needs:

More life on the streets at night and on weekends as a way to dilute social problems
To provide better restaurants, as these make up the heart of Chinatown and are key to improving its business sector
To modernize the cultural centre and museum as a viable attraction while keeping its neighbourhood aspects
To cater more to its residents through everyday services such as groceries and restaurants
To take advantage of its fine-grained streetscape pattern, which offers a unique sidewalk experience compared to newer auto-oriented suburban areas
To involve younger community members in decision-making roles
To renovate its 20 heritage buildings, creating a historic district unparalleled in Western Canada, which will increase appeal to tourists and residents, leading to more local spending
To be clean and safe in order to reduce negative images, such as illegal drug use and panhandling, associated with the Downtown Eastside in generalSome plans already in place in order to preserve some Asian heritage include the creation of the Chinatown Storytelling Centre. It is a purpose-built cultural space that celebrates stories of the Chinese Canadian experience told through the lens of Vancouver's Chinatown. The Storytelling Centre shares the important legacy and history of the Chinese Canadian experience and its larger contribution to city and nation-building. The Storytelling Centre is set to open in 2020. 


=== International Village ===
In recent years Chinatown has seen growth in new construction as a downtown building boom continued into the former Expo 86 lands, which adjoin Chinatown. New high-rise towers are being constructed around the old Expo 86 site, including International Village, which was built in 1998 and is located next to Stadium–Chinatown SkyTrain station. Anchored by Cineplex Odeon International Village Cinemas and flanked by Rexall Drugstore and Yokoyaya 123, the International Village Shopping Centre is a 300,000 ft² entertainment and shopping venue. It is one of the first master-planned communities in Greater Vancouver; is the central hub connecting Gastown, Chinatown, and Yaletown; and is adjacent to the Rogers Arena, the Plaza of Nations, and BC Place Stadium.
International Village was designed to be downtown's answer to the Asian malls found in the Golden Village, though it is not as racially exclusive and includes businesses and residents that are non-Chinese.
International Village also refers to the name given to the area by developer Henderson Development (Canada) Ltd., a subsidiary of Henderson Land Development.
International Village was commonly called Tinseltown, based on one of the brands of theatre chain Cinemark Theatres, which owned the building before Cineplex did.


=== Condominium Development ===

Vancouver city councillors voted in 2011 to raise building height restrictions in Chinatown in order to boost its population density. A limit of 9 stories for most of the neighbourhood was set, with a maximum of 15 stories on the busiest streets. Highrises close to Stadium-Chinatown Station have already been built, with more condominium towers under construction, some projects taking advantage of empty lots that sat unused for decades. Due to the unconventional lot sizes, one 9-storey condominium is only 25 feet wide. However, that is not expected to be a problem in Vancouver, which has a market for affordable smaller-scale homes. Critics of highrise development speculate that the plan will effectively divide up the neighbourhood to form a ""Great Wall of Chinatown"" as lower-income residents are marginalized and displaced.


== Architecture ==

The neighbourhood was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2011.Ongoing efforts at revitalization include efforts by the business community to improve safety by hiring private security, considering new marketing promotions, and introducing residential units into the neighbourhood by restoring and renovating heritage buildings. The current focus is on the restoration and adaptive reuse of the distinctive association buildings.


=== Gates ===

The China Gate (next to the Chinese Cultural Centre, near the intersection with Carrall) facing Pender Street was donated to the City of Vancouver by the Government of the People's Republic of China following the Expo 86 world's fair, where it was on display. After being displayed for almost 20 years at its current location, the gate was rebuilt and received a major renovation of its façade employing stone and steel. Funding for the renovation came from government and private sources; the renovated gate was unveiled during the October 2005 visit of Guangdong governor Huang Huahua.

This is not to be confused with the larger Millennium Gate, which straddles Pender Street at the west end of Chinatown, near the intersection with Taylor Street. The Millennium Gate was approved on September 20, 2001, and erected in 2002 at the same site as a temporary wooden arch built to celebrate the 1901 royal tour by the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York. Joe Y. Wai designed the Millennium Gate.


=== Notable buildings ===
The Sam Kee Company, run by Chang Toy, one of the wealthier merchants in turn-of-the-20th-century Chinatown, bought the land for the Sam Kee Building as a standard-sized lot in 1903. However, in 1912 the city widened Pender Street, expropriating all but 6 feet of the Pender Street side of the lot. In 1913 the architects Brown and Gillam designed this narrow, steel-framed free-standing building on the remaining 6-foot strip. The basement, extending under the sidewalk and much wider than the rest of the building, housed public baths, with shops on the ground floor and offices above (such basements in Vancouver were once common and zoned as ""areaways""). The 1980s' rehabilitation of the building for Jack Chow was designed by Soren Rasmussen Architect and completed in 1986.
The Lord Strathcona Elementary School is the oldest public school in Greater Vancouver and the only public school serving Vancouver's Chinatown.


=== Neon signs ===

Chinatown was once known for its neon signs, but like the rest of the city, lost many signs to changing times and a sign bylaw passed in 1974. The last of these was the Ho Ho sign (which showed a rice bowl and chop sticks), which was removed in 1997.
A large 45 ft (14 m) tall neon sign was approved for the Chinatown Plaza parkade project in 2008 under the City of Vancouver's Great Beginnings initiative. The new sign was installed in March 2010.In 2017, a neon sign featuring a large green and yellow-coloured rooster for the Sai Woo Restaurant was installed on Pender Street. The new owner of the Sai Woo was made aware of the original sign that hung outside the earlier incarnation of the restaurant (1925–59) from a one-second clip from a movie of a 1958 parade in Chinatown, and launched a search for the original sign which was unsuccessful. The sign was recreated from the archived footage. At the same time, plans were announced to relight the tall Ho Ho sign in 2018 or 2019.

163,Science World (Vancouver),"Science World is a science centre run by a not-for-profit organization of the same name in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is located at the end of False Creek and features many permanent interactive exhibits and displays, as well as areas with varying topics throughout the years.
Prior to the building being handed over to Science World by the city government in 1987, the building was built as Expo Centre for the Expo 86 world's fair. Following the end of Expo 86, the building was re-purposed as a science centre. The science centre opened on May 6, 1989, as Science World. From 2005 to 2020, the museum was branded as Science World at Telus World of Science, before it reverted back to its original name.


== History ==
In 1977, Barbara Brink ran mobile hands-on exhibits known as the Extended I around the Lower Mainland. Later, the temporary Arts, Sciences & Technology Centre opened in downtown Vancouver on January 15, 1982, attracting over 600,000 visitors. Another 400,000 benefited from the centre's outreach programs, which were delivered around the province.
When Vancouver was chosen to host the transportation-themed 1986 World's Fair (Expo 86), a Buckminster Fuller–inspired geodesic dome was designed by Expo's chief architect Bruno Freschi to serve as the fair's Expo Centre. Construction began in 1984 and was completed by early 1985. After Expo closed its gates in October of the following year, an intensive lobbying campaign was launched to secure the landmark building, relocate the ""Arts, Sciences and Technology Centre"" into the post-Expo dome, and convert the Expo Centre into Science World. With much government backing, the dome was obtained from the province and a massive fund-raising campaign ensued. Donations from the federal, provincial and municipal governments, the GVRD, the private sector, foundations, and individuals contributed $19.1 million to build an addition to the Expo Centre, redesign the interior and fabricate exhibits. In 1988, in a four-month preview, over 310,000 visitors came to see the new building. A year later, the 400-seat Omnimax theatre in the upper section of the dome was opened, extending upon the 3D IMAX theatre which was built in 1986 for the Expo ""Transitions"" film series.The centre entered its first title sponsorship agreement with Alcan Inc. in 1996, renaming its Omnimax Theatre the Alcan Omnimax Theatre. Alcan later decided to sponsor the organization in different ways and the theatre returned to its original name, the Omnimax Theatre. 

In January 2005, the building was officially renamed ""Telusphere"" as part of an agreement where Telus gave a $9-million donation in return for the naming rights to the building. This new name proved universally unpopular. In mid-2005, the name of the science centre was changed to ""Science World at the Telus World of Science"". The brand ""Telus World of Science"" was used for several other science centres in Calgary and Edmonton. The naming rights agreement ended in 2020, with the science centre dropping ""Telus World of Science"" from its name. During this period, the name change did not affect the nearby Main Street–Science World SkyTrain station.
During the 2010 Winter Olympics, Science World played host to ""Sochi World"", a hospitality area representing the country of Russia, hosts of the 2014 Winter Olympics. The attraction closed in mid-January 2010 to facilitate the transformation, and was re-opened that March. Science World underwent renovation after the 2010 Winter Olympics. The indoor renovations were completed by mid-2012 and the adjacent Ken Spencer Science Park opened in late 2012.On July 29, 2020, the organization's board of governors announced that BC Liberal MLA from Surrey-White Rock, Tracy Redies, would be resigning her legislature seat and taking over as the CEO of Science World, from September 14, 2020. The new CEO would be replacing the interim CEO, Janet Wood.


== Outreach ==

Science World runs a variety of outreach programs all over British Columbia. Some examples include On the Road, where staff travel extensively throughout the province to conduct workshops and present science-themed shows in schools and communities that otherwise would not have access to a local science centre; Super Science Club, where Science World educators conduct after-school programs in underserved schools to inspire at-risk children to become passionate about lifelong science and technology learning; and Opening the Door, where high-school students with an interest in science-based careers are offered the opportunity to network with current science professionals.

The cafe was opened in 1942 and has served as a set for movies and television shows that want to film in a restaurant with an old-fashioned appearance.On September 15, 2018, Craig Moss, a travel writer with the London newspaper The Telegraph, in consultation with a team of experts, published a list of the world's 50 best cafes, which included the Ovaltine.Keith McKellar devoted a chapter to the cafe in his book Neon Eulogy, calling it ""easily Vancouver's most prized antique cafe.""Randall Wong, the first Chinese-Canadian federal judge in Canada, worked at the Ovaltine in his youth. At that time the Ovaltine was near a court and a police station, and Wong attributed his interest in the law to his conversations with patrons who worked in law enforcement.

166,Granville Island,"Granville Island is a peninsula and shopping district in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is located across False Creek from Downtown Vancouver under the south end of the Granville Street Bridge. The peninsula was once an industrial manufacturing area, but today it is a hotspot for Vancouver tourism and entertainment. The area was named after Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville.
The island is home to 275 businesses and facilities that employ more than 2,500 people and generates more than $215-million in economic activity each year.Granville Island provides amenities such as a large public market, an extensive marina, a hotel, Arts Umbrella, False Creek Community Centre, various performing arts theatres including Vancouver's only professional improvisational theatre company Vancouver Theatresports League, the Arts Club Theatre Company and Carousel Theatre, fine arts galleries, and variety of shopping areas. 

The Granville Island Public Market features a farmers' market, day vendors, and artists offering local Vancouver goods. There are 50 permanent retailers and typically more than one-hundred day vendors in stalls throughout the market selling a variety of artisan cottage-industry foods and handmade crafts on a rotating schedule.  This location was used in the finale of the film Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011).
Granville Island Brewing Co. is also the name of a beer company which originated on Granville Island in 1984, but whose main base of operations was moved to Kelowna, British Columbia some time later. In 2009 it was purchased by Molson's Brewery and continues to brew small batches of its varieties at the Granville Island brewing original site, and offers beer tasting and tours of their brewing facilities.
Ocean Concrete is the longest-established tenant on the island, having set up shop there in 1917. In 2014, OSGEMEOS (Portuguese for THE TWINS), consisting of brother duo Gustavo and Otavio Pandolfo, revamped the concrete silos with their ongoing mural project, 'Giants'.Granville Island is the central location of several annual festivals, including the Vancouver International Children's Festival, the Vancouver Fringe Festival, and the Vancouver Writers Fest.


== Transportation ==
Two companies, False Creek Ferries and Aquabus, provide ferry service from Granville Island to Downtown Vancouver including numerous stops in Yaletown, Downtown South/False Creek, and the West End as well as Vanier Park near Kitsilano Beach. Other water transportation options include a taxi service to Bowen Island provided by English Bay Launch and a number of private tours.
WESTCOAST Sightseeing and Vancouver Trolley Hop-On, Hop-Off services both have stops located at Granville Island.
Between 1998 and 2011, a free streetcar route was operated by the Vancouver Downtown Historic Railway between Granville Island and SkyTrain's Olympic Village in the SE False Creek neighborhood. This streetcar is now permanently shut down.


== History ==
The peninsula was originally used by First Nations as a fishing area.The city of Vancouver was called Granville until it was renamed in 1886, but the former name was kept and given to Granville Street, which spanned the small inlet known as False Creek. False Creek in the late 19th century was more than twice today's size, and its tidal flats included a large permanent sandbar over which spanned the original, rickety, wooden Granville Street bridge. This sandbar, which would eventually become Granville Island, was first mapped by Captain George Henry Richards in the British Boundary Commission's naval expedition in 1858-59, and the island today conforms roughly to the size and shape documented at that time. A British Admiralty Chart of 1893 shows the island in greater detail and conforming even more accurately to today's Granville Island.The first attempt to stabilize the sandbar by driving piles around the perimeter was an unofficial attempt to create some free real estate shortly after the creation of the original Granville Street bridge in 1889. The Federal government put a stop to the work as a menace to navigation, but the piles are still visible in a photo taken in 1891.In 1915, with the port of Vancouver growing, the newly formed Vancouver Harbour Commission approved a reclamation project in False Creek for an industrial area. A 14-hectare (35-acre) island, connected to the mainland by a combined road and rail bridge at its south end, was to be built. Almost 760,000 cubic metres (1,000,000 cu yd) of fill was dredged largely by a man named Alvin Kingston, from the surrounding waters of False Creek to create the island under the Granville Street Bridge. The total cost for the reclamation was $342,000. It was originally called Industrial Island, but Granville Island, named after the bridge that ran directly overhead, was the name that stuck.
The very first tenant, B.C. Equipment Ltd., set the standard by building a wood-framed machine shop, clad on all sides in corrugated tin, at the Island's western end. (Today the same structure houses part of the Granville Island Public Market.) The company repaired and assembled heavy equipment for mining and forestry industries and used barges for shipping.
By 1923 virtually every lot on the Island was occupied, mostly by similar corrugated-tin factories. 
During the Great Depression, one of Vancouver's several hobo jungles sprang up on the False Creek flats opposite Granville Island's north shore. ""Shackers"" lived on the island, in town, or in floathouses, and survived by fishing and beachcombing and sold salmon, smelt, and wood door to door or at the public market on Main Street. They were basically self-sufficient and were left alone.
During the Second World War, Wright's Canadian Ropes on the island was Canada's biggest manufacturer of heavy-duty wire rope. Their Green Heart product was supplied to forestry and mining industries. A fire in 1953 gutted their Granville Island factory so they moved to south Vancouver in 1956.
In 1972, a federal order-in-council assigned management of the 14-hectare site to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). The federal government invested $24.7 million there between 1973 and 1982. In 1979, the federal and provincial governments converted a 50,000 square foot building to the Public Market. In 1980, the Emily Carr University of Art & Design was added to the island.
Ron Basford, the Minister responsible for CMHC was, was referred to as Mr. Granville and was later recognized with the naming of Ron Basford Park on Granville Island.
In 2016, the federal government announced a commitment to develop a 2040 plan to redevelop the island, in part because the Emily Carr University was going to move off the island.


== Granville Island Public Market ==
The Granville Island Public Market was established in 1979 as a location where farmers and other food vendors could sell to consumers. It operates year-round in an enclosed facility where customers can purchase fresh produce, meat, fish and seafood, cheeses and other products, many locally sourced. There are generally 50 vendors in the market. The market includes retail food vendors, selling a range of items from Mexican, Asian, Greek and deli food to candy and snacks. The market attracts both local residents and tourists. The market includes a ""kids market"" designed for children.

167,St. Lawrence (restaurant),"Granville Island is a peninsula and shopping district in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is located across False Creek from Downtown Vancouver under the south end of the Granville Street Bridge. The peninsula was once an industrial manufacturing area, but today it is a hotspot for Vancouver tourism and entertainment. The area was named after Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville.
The island is home to 275 businesses and facilities that employ more than 2,500 people and generates more than $215-million in economic activity each year.Granville Island provides amenities such as a large public market, an extensive marina, a hotel, Arts Umbrella, False Creek Community Centre, various performing arts theatres including Vancouver's only professional improvisational theatre company Vancouver Theatresports League, the Arts Club Theatre Company and Carousel Theatre, fine arts galleries, and variety of shopping areas. 

The Granville Island Public Market features a farmers' market, day vendors, and artists offering local Vancouver goods. There are 50 permanent retailers and typically more than one-hundred day vendors in stalls throughout the market selling a variety of artisan cottage-industry foods and handmade crafts on a rotating schedule.  This location was used in the finale of the film Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011).
Granville Island Brewing Co. is also the name of a beer company which originated on Granville Island in 1984, but whose main base of operations was moved to Kelowna, British Columbia some time later. In 2009 it was purchased by Molson's Brewery and continues to brew small batches of its varieties at the Granville Island brewing original site, and offers beer tasting and tours of their brewing facilities.
Ocean Concrete is the longest-established tenant on the island, having set up shop there in 1917. In 2014, OSGEMEOS (Portuguese for THE TWINS), consisting of brother duo Gustavo and Otavio Pandolfo, revamped the concrete silos with their ongoing mural project, 'Giants'.Granville Island is the central location of several annual festivals, including the Vancouver International Children's Festival, the Vancouver Fringe Festival, and the Vancouver Writers Fest.


== Transportation ==
Two companies, False Creek Ferries and Aquabus, provide ferry service from Granville Island to Downtown Vancouver including numerous stops in Yaletown, Downtown South/False Creek, and the West End as well as Vanier Park near Kitsilano Beach. Other water transportation options include a taxi service to Bowen Island provided by English Bay Launch and a number of private tours.
WESTCOAST Sightseeing and Vancouver Trolley Hop-On, Hop-Off services both have stops located at Granville Island.
Between 1998 and 2011, a free streetcar route was operated by the Vancouver Downtown Historic Railway between Granville Island and SkyTrain's Olympic Village in the SE False Creek neighborhood. This streetcar is now permanently shut down.


== History ==
The peninsula was originally used by First Nations as a fishing area.The city of Vancouver was called Granville until it was renamed in 1886, but the former name was kept and given to Granville Street, which spanned the small inlet known as False Creek. False Creek in the late 19th century was more than twice today's size, and its tidal flats included a large permanent sandbar over which spanned the original, rickety, wooden Granville Street bridge. This sandbar, which would eventually become Granville Island, was first mapped by Captain George Henry Richards in the British Boundary Commission's naval expedition in 1858-59, and the island today conforms roughly to the size and shape documented at that time. A British Admiralty Chart of 1893 shows the island in greater detail and conforming even more accurately to today's Granville Island.The first attempt to stabilize the sandbar by driving piles around the perimeter was an unofficial attempt to create some free real estate shortly after the creation of the original Granville Street bridge in 1889. The Federal government put a stop to the work as a menace to navigation, but the piles are still visible in a photo taken in 1891.In 1915, with the port of Vancouver growing, the newly formed Vancouver Harbour Commission approved a reclamation project in False Creek for an industrial area. A 14-hectare (35-acre) island, connected to the mainland by a combined road and rail bridge at its south end, was to be built. Almost 760,000 cubic metres (1,000,000 cu yd) of fill was dredged largely by a man named Alvin Kingston, from the surrounding waters of False Creek to create the island under the Granville Street Bridge. The total cost for the reclamation was $342,000. It was originally called Industrial Island, but Granville Island, named after the bridge that ran directly overhead, was the name that stuck.
The very first tenant, B.C. Equipment Ltd., set the standard by building a wood-framed machine shop, clad on all sides in corrugated tin, at the Island's western end. (Today the same structure houses part of the Granville Island Public Market.) The company repaired and assembled heavy equipment for mining and forestry industries and used barges for shipping.
By 1923 virtually every lot on the Island was occupied, mostly by similar corrugated-tin factories. 
During the Great Depression, one of Vancouver's several hobo jungles sprang up on the False Creek flats opposite Granville Island's north shore. ""Shackers"" lived on the island, in town, or in floathouses, and survived by fishing and beachcombing and sold salmon, smelt, and wood door to door or at the public market on Main Street. They were basically self-sufficient and were left alone.
During the Second World War, Wright's Canadian Ropes on the island was Canada's biggest manufacturer of heavy-duty wire rope. Their Green Heart product was supplied to forestry and mining industries. A fire in 1953 gutted their Granville Island factory so they moved to south Vancouver in 1956.
In 1972, a federal order-in-council assigned management of the 14-hectare site to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). The federal government invested $24.7 million there between 1973 and 1982. In 1979, the federal and provincial governments converted a 50,000 square foot building to the Public Market. In 1980, the Emily Carr University of Art & Design was added to the island.
Ron Basford, the Minister responsible for CMHC was, was referred to as Mr. Granville and was later recognized with the naming of Ron Basford Park on Granville Island.
In 2016, the federal government announced a commitment to develop a 2040 plan to redevelop the island, in part because the Emily Carr University was going to move off the island.


== Granville Island Public Market ==
The Granville Island Public Market was established in 1979 as a location where farmers and other food vendors could sell to consumers. It operates year-round in an enclosed facility where customers can purchase fresh produce, meat, fish and seafood, cheeses and other products, many locally sourced. There are generally 50 vendors in the market. The market includes retail food vendors, selling a range of items from Mexican, Asian, Greek and deli food to candy and snacks. The market attracts both local residents and tourists. The market includes a ""kids market"" designed for children.

168,Firehall Arts Centre,"The Firehall Arts Centre (also called the Firehall Centre for the Arts) is an arts centre in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The building also falls within the borders of Gastown. Firehall is a small building, originally built as a fire station in 1906. Three theatre companies are based out of Firehall: Touchstone Theatre, Firehall Theatre Company, and Axis Mime. Firehall is devoted to exhibiting dance, performance art, and new plays. Firehall is Vancouver's foremost exhibitor of experimental theatre. The theatre has a 150-seat capacity. St. James Anglican Church is diagonally opposite the intersection from Firehall. Every year, Firehall hosts a dance festival called ""Dancing on the Edge"" that lasts two weeks.

169,Portobello West,"Portobello West fashion and art market is a seasonal market held in Vancouver, BC, Canada. The Market is a regular event from March to December at which local designers and artisans can sell their creations directly to the public. 
It was established in August 2006 by Carlie Smith, a graduate of the University of Victoria who, after living in London, England for two years, wanted to bring the European style market atmosphere to her home town. Carlie envisioned a regular event that would raise the profile of local designers and artisans as well as be a regular outdoor community event.


== Location ==
Originally held at the Plaza of Nations, Portobello West relocated to the Rocky Mountaineer Station in November 2006 as a result of the Plaza's closure. It currently takes place at Creekside Community Centre (1 Athlete's Way, Vancouver) in the Olympic Village/False Creek area.


== Data ==
The inaugural market was attended by some 3,000 shoppers and had 92 vendors selling local fashion and art products. Since then the average attendance has been 1,100 shoppers and 120 vendors (not including food and drink vendors).
In November 2006, the Market suffered a drop in attendance as a result of a last minute change of location from the Plaza of Nations to the Rocky Mountaineer Station and a sudden snowfall on the market day. The attendance improved again for the first ever Holiday Market on the second Sunday of December 2006.
Portobello West has only ever had one January Market and one February Market, both in 2007. After consultation with local artists and designers and the general public, the January and February Markets were determined to be unpopular, predominantly as a result of the consistently inclement weather in the region during those months.
In 2008 the Market introduced a two-day season opener on the last weekend of March and a two-day Holiday Season Market on the second weekend of December, with both events drawing nearly 3,000 shoppers across both days.
In 2009 the Market added another two-day Market at the end of November, expanding the Holiday Season Markets to 4 days.
Portobello West has no Olympic Markets planned for February 2010.


== Trivia ==
The name 'Portobello West' was suggested by Carlie's father, Grant 'Fuzzy' Smith, as a reference to the famous Portobello Road market in London, England and also to the location of the new market (in Western Canada).
Commonly referred to as 'The Market' and 'Portobello'.
In 2008, Portobello West stopped using paper applications, transferring all application processes to a web-based system.
In 2009, Carlie Smith took the concept of Portobello West to Toronto, Canada and established Portobello East (renamed for its more Eastern location).

170,Kissa Tanto,"Kissa Tanto is an Italian-Japanese fusion restaurant in the Chinatown neighborhood of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The 80-seat restaurant, which opened in June 2016, is located on the second floor of 263 E Pender St. Its name comes from the Japanese word kissa, referring to the jazz cafes of 1960s Tokyo, and Italian tanto, meaning ""a lot"" or ""so much"". Kissa Tanto is co-owned by restaurateur Tannis Ling, executive chef Joël Watanabe, and sous chef Alain Chow, all of whom were involved with Chinese brasserie Bao Bei, also in Chinatown. Since its launch, Kissa Tanto has garnered positive reviews for its romantic, retro-styled design philosophy and innovative menu.


== Development ==
After the success of Bao Bei, Ling, Watanabe, and Chow were interested in creating a second restaurant, but did not have a specific idea in mind. They consulted with Ste. Marie, the Vancouver-based studio which designed Bao Bei, as well as other Vancouver restaurants such as, St. Lawrence, Savio Volpe and Ask for Luigi. The designers asked for a defined food concept to work with before starting to plan. Watanabe suggested Japanese-Italian: ""Everybody liked it and it stuck.""The restaurant was conceived as a romantic escape from the everyday. Tannis Ling told Monocle magazine ""We imagined Kissa Tanto as a little secret hideaway."" According to Watanabe, the second-story location was selected because it ""hit all the right notes. Dark. Upstairs. We wanted it to be an adventure."" The lease for the space, which had been empty for thirty years prior, was secured in February 2015, and the group took possession in late summer the same year. Hiring began in October 2015. Construction was ongoing through March 2016, and the space was completed by late April, when the restaurant held its soft open. The restaurant officially opened in June 2016.


== Visual design ==

The exterior of Kissa Tanto is designed to be unobtrusive, blending into the neighborhood and creating a sense of discovery for patrons. The red brick building, with its jade-green Chinese-style roof tile, was left in its original condition of slight disrepair. A small purple neon sign reading ""KT"" and a royal-blue awning reading ""Kissa Tanto"" are the only outward indications that the restaurant is there. Upon entering, a framed sign beside the door exhorts patrons to ""Please fix your hair, and remove the mud from your boots."" A steep staircase leads up to the restaurant proper, which is hidden behind thick blue velvet curtains.The restaurant's interior is inspired by the mid-century modern design movement, also paying homage to the work of Italian architect Gio Ponti. Aesthetically, it references the jazz cafes which inspired its name, with specific homage to the famous Hotel Okura Tokyo. The coved ceiling, with high-gloss paint, is characteristic of those cafes. The pixellated design of the floor tiling draws inspiration from the John Gall paperback covers of Haruki Murakami novels. Food critic Pete Wells of The New York Times compared the color palette, which incorporates raspberry, blue-green, and royal blue, to that of a David Lynch film. Mid-century decorative elements include curved banquettes, banker's lamps, extensive use of maple and walnut, and polished brass fixtures. A raised, oversized dining booth called ""the hot tub"" by staff dominates the rear of the restaurant. Vinyl records and knick-knacks are stacked on dark wood shelves behind the bar, replacing the traditional mirror-backed bar.Because of energy-consumption guidelines mandated by the City of Vancouver, the majority of the lighting in Kissa Tanto is provided by LED bulbs. The restaurant has minimal, moody lighting with only a single chandelier, otherwise using lighting at eye level and below to immerse patrons in the atmosphere. The restaurant's background music is mostly jazz, with some blues tracks.The overall impression is of a place grounded in neither time, nor space. The aesthetic suggests the past, but without being anchored to any specific time period. Watanabe stated that the atmosphere makes diners ""feel literally transported...You feel New York or L.A. in its heyday."" In their review, Canada's 100 Best wrote, ""We could be anywhere—New York, Tokyo, San Francisco.""


== Cuisine ==

Kissa Tanto serves a modern fusion of Italian and Japanese cuisine, a pairing that appears unusual, but has some historical and culinary basis. Italian food, known as itameshi, has been popular in Japan since the 1920s, and Italian ingredients are sometimes incorporated into Japanese cooking. Both cuisines focus on simplicity, umami flavors, and local ingredients.The menu draws from chef Watanabe's family background and personal history. His father is Japanese, his mother French-Canadian and Corsican. He grew up around South American and Mexican cuisine, which inform his present style. He worked as a sushi chef for ten years, and has experience at Italian and French restaurants. Watanabe described the process of developing dishes for Kissa Tanto as ""an intuitive thing...we're not trying to force it.""The produce and meat are locally sourced and sustainable. Fish and meat are brought in whole and butchered in-house, so less common cuts like pork loin, pork belly, and fish collar are often available as daily specials. Dressings, pickled vegetables, garnishes, and sourdough bread are made in-house. The sourdough bread is served with nori butter and olive oil.Many dishes incorporate traditional Japanese ingredients like kombu (edible kelp), miso (fermented soybean paste), and katsuobushi (shaved smoked skipjack tuna) into traditional Italian dishes such as lasagna and tajarin. Others, such as the Japanese croquettes and chawanmushi, incorporate Italian touches like parmesan cheese. The restaurant does not abide by strict rules for creating its fused dishes, according to Watanabe: ""Sometimes dishes tend to feel more Italian and sometimes more Japanese. It’s very rare that it’s right in the middle"". Alexandra Gill of The Globe and Mail found that many dishes, such as the chilled vegetable platter, ""speak fervently to Vancouver."" Discussing the reception of the cross-cultural menu, Watanabe said ""We’ve had a lot of compliments from Italians,"" and ""Japanese people think it’s odd, but they love it.""

The fried fish has been singled out by reviewers as the restaurant's signature dish. It consists of a whole fish or large cut like fish collar, scored in a diamond pattern, battered in potato or rice flour and flash fried. It is served with grated-daikon soy sauce for dipping. Gill noted the rarity of seeing whole fish served in Vancouver, and lauded the kitchen for having the confidence to present the dish that way.


== Reception ==
Kissa Tanto has been placed on numerous best-of lists since its debut, including, in its first year, several lists of best new restaurants. In 2016, it was number one on EnRoute magazine's list of the top ten new Canadian restaurants. Alexandra Gill placed it on top of her 2016 list of the ten best new restaurants in Vancouver. Since 2017 (the first year for which it was eligible), it has been ranked within the top 20 of the Canada's 100 Best list, at 14th (2017), 10th (2018), 16th (2019), and 12th (2020) respectively. On the 2017 list, it was named best new restaurant. Vancouver Magazine has awarded it ""Best New Design"" (2017) and ""Best Pan-Asian"" (2017, 2019).


=== Design ===
Critics have highlighted Kissa Tanto's glamorous, dreamlike atmosphere, which seems to transport diners into a place out of fantasy. Canada's 100 Best called it a ""charmingly eccentric, genre-defying hideaway"". Pete Wells wrote that the design ""conjures an imaginary parallel world"". Vancouver Magazine described it as ""a vision so romantic, so complete, it could be a film set"". The review in EnRoute also evoked film: ""suddenly I’m starring in a film noir with Italian-Japanese subtitles.""  Writing for ChefsFeed, Mallory Farrugia said that entering the restaurant is ""as if you’ve crossed over into a Murakami novel"". Reviewers have noted that diners tend to respond to its fanciful aesthetic in kind. Lindsay Anderson of Bon Appétit described Kissa Tanto as ""an occasion worth dressing up for"". Wells wrote that during his visit, ""Everybody seemed to have gotten dolled up just for the fun of it."" In Condé Nast Traveler, Guy Saddy wrote ""Much like the room itself, the patrons here are dressed for dinner—in a hip, never formal, way.""


=== Cuisine ===
The unusual combination of Italian and Japanese cuisine has been positively received by critics and diners alike. Particular attention has been given to Watanabe for finding common ground between the apparently disparate cuisines of Italy and Japan. EnRoute magazine stated, ""Watanabe proves that Italy and Japan are natural bedfellows, married by a shared love of noodles, mushrooms and umami."" For the Vancouver Sun, Mia Stainsby said that the combination was ""a route on which [Watanabe] could drive off a cliff without a sixth sense about balance and harmony."" The review in Monocle stated ""It’s testament to Watanabe’s finesse that ingredients and techniques from two different cultures can come together seamlessly and, indeed, enhance the best aspects of each other."" Farrugia described the food as maximalist, highlighting the abundance of distinct and intriguing textures across the menu. ""The food of Kissa Tanto,"" she wrote, ""signals a burgeoning desire for fiercer creativity, conviction, and volume; for, well, more."" Hadani Ditmars of Wallpaper magazine called it ""as subtly layered as the design"".

171,2010 Olympic Village,"For the location of the Olympic Village in Singapore, see Nanyang Technological University or 2010 Summer Youth Olympics#Youth Olympic Village

The Vancouver Olympic Village (VVL), is an Olympic Village built by Millennium Development Group for the 2010 Winter Olympics and 2010 Winter Paralympics hosted in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. There are over a thousand units, ranging over a million square feet, that was able to accommodate over 2,800 athletes, coaches, and officials for the 2010 Winter Olympics.The site, a former industrial area which mostly consisted of parking lots, is located on the shoreline at the southeast corner of False Creek, north of Second Avenue between Quebec and Manitoba Streets. Just south of Science World, its waterfront is part of the False Creek Seawall promenade and bike route, and is adjacent to the stations of the Granville Island Heritage Railway, the Spyglass Place pedestrian ferry wharf (served by Aquabus and False Creek Ferries), the Science World pedestrian ferry wharf (normally served by Aquabus and False Creek Ferries but closed temporarily from 25 January 2010 to 24 March 2010) and the Main Street and Olympic Village SkyTrain stations.


== Whistler Olympic and Paralympic Village ==
The Whistler Olympic and Paralympic Village (WVL) is located in Whistler, British Columbia, it served the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 Winter Paralympics. Smaller than the VVL, it accommodated 2,400 athletes, coaches, and officials with 450 beds made especially with wheelchair access. Site preparation began in 2006 with construction starting in March 2007 and it was completed in Summer 2009.


== About ==
The site has 252 affordable housing units and another 100 units are for ""modest market housing"". Southeast False Creek is the designation given to the neighbourhood the Olympic Village resides in, bordered by Cambie, Main, West 2nd Avenue, and False Creek.  The City of Vancouver projects that Southeast False Creek will eventually become home to up to 16,000 people by 2020.The site currently boasts a 45,000 square foot community centre, named the Creekside Community Recreation Centre.

		
		
		
		
		


== Construction ==

Preparation and construction of the site Vancouver began in February 2006. Construction was completed on 1 November 2009 by the Millennium Development Group, and turned over to the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (VANOC) for use during the Winter Games. On 7 April 2010 it was returned to the City of Vancouver. The village was converted into residential housing, a community centre, daycare, retail, and service spaces.Residents released video documenting major problems with their units, including water pouring out of light fixtures, heat not working, cracks in ceilings, hardwood floors bubbling from moisture and bedrooms too small to fit a bed. More than 60 condo owners at the Village filed a class-action lawsuit against the builder. The lawsuits were subsequently dropped.
On December 12, 2014, the City of Vancouver unveiled a plaque honouring Millennium Development Group's role in designing, developing and constructing the Olympic Village, named ""Millennium Water Olympic Village"". The wording on the plaque states:     

""North America's first LEED Platinum community was designed, developed and constructed by Peter and Shahram Malek's Millennium Development Group in time to open as the athletes' village for the successful Vancouver 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.
Formerly an industrial site, Millennium Water Olympic Village was the catalyst for the revitalization of the surrounding False Creek neighbourhood and is a testament to the innovation, hard work and community spirit of the Malekyazdi family and hundreds of men and women who helped make this vision a reality.""


== Funding crisis ==
On January 15, 2009, Jody Andrews, the deputy city manager overseeing construction of the Olympic Village, resigned. Vancouver city manager, Penny Ballem, said ""There was no reason for the public to lose confidence in City Hall over the resignation"".Vancouver Mayor, Gregor Robertson, made a request to the British Columbia provincial government to allow the City of Vancouver to borrow additional funds to complete the project.  On January 18, 2009, an emergency meeting convened by the BC Legislature approved Bill 47, allowing the City of Vancouver unlimited access to additional funds for the development of the Olympic Village. The estimated new total cost is CAN$1 billion to build VVL, approximately CAN$ 467 million dollars were required by the City of Vancouver to complete the project. The project ran into financial woes late last year as well as the lender, Fortress Investment Group, a New York hedge fund, stopped payments to the village's holding company, SEFC Properties Ltd. Bill 47 is an unusual amendment to the charter for the Olympics in that it changes the original requirement that all additional borrowing is prohibited without a public referendum, and also that it was until this legislation was passed that it was illegal for the City of Vancouver to pursue such financial dealings.  The city, in order to meet its Olympics commitments, required extraordinary legislative proceedings to amend the city's charter to allow it to borrow to buy out the loan from Fortress.In November 2010, seven months after the successful completion of the 2010 Olympic Winter Games, the village's holding company and the City of Vancouver agreed to place the property into voluntary receivership.A review by Rob MacDonald, a noted Vancouver developer, for the Vancouver Sun, and subsequently by others, praised the developer, Millennium Development Group, for their accomplishment in creating the Vancouver Olympic Village under trying circumstances.


== Australia banner controversy ==
A giant banner hung from the Village by members of the Australian team attracted controversy in early February 2010 when a member of the International Olympic Committee toured the site and expressed concern that it might contravene policy, as the banner is not the flag of Australia but rather depicts a kangaroo wearing boxing gloves. The Australian deputy prime minister at the time Julia Gillard called the request for the banner's removal a disgrace. According to a representative of the Australian team, the flag has been at every Olympic Village since the 2000 Games in Sydney. The image had flown from the victorious Australian yacht in the 1983 America's Cup and is now a mascot of Australia's Olympic teams; the Australian Olympic Committee owns the image's trademark. After IOC president Jacques Rogge discussed the issue with John Coates, chief of the AOC, it was confirmed that the flag could remain at the Olympic Village. ""While the IOC is of the view that the display of the boxing kangaroo at the Olympic village is a breach of the IOC rules relating to clean venues, the IOC is not going to request us to take down the boxing kangaroo flag on this occasion,"" Coates said. The AOC was required to register the image with the IOC. The controversy sparked a demand for a version of the boxing-kangaroo flag at a Vancouver flag shop.

Its use in this context has been controversial among the Inuit, and the First Nations within British Columbia. Although the design has been questioned, people believe it pays tribute to Alvin Kanak's 1986 inuksuk at English Bay. Friendship and the welcoming of the world are the meanings of both the English Bay structure and the 2010 Winter Olympics emblem.A plaque near the work reads: ""This ancient symbol of the Inuit culture is traditionally used as a landmark and navigational aid and also represents northern hospitality and friendship. Constructed of grey granite by Alvin Kanak of Rankin Inlet, this monument was commissioned by the Government of the Northwest Territories for its Pavilion at EXPO '86 and later given to the city of Vancouver. In 1987 the Inukshuk was moved to this site and sponsored as a gift to the City by Coast Hotels & Resorts through the Vancouver Legacies program.""

Granville was renamed Vancouver and the town was incorporated as a city on April 6, 1886. This building burned down in the Great Vancouver Fire of June 13, 1886. The heat of the fire melted the church bell into a puddle that was eventually put on display at the Museum of Vancouver.The present (and third) church building was designed by Adrian Gilbert Scott who later designed the Church of St. Mary and St. Joseph, Poplar, London, England which has architectural similarities. The building is the second to be built at this location on land donated by the Canadian Pacific Railway. Its design is a combination of Art Deco, Romanesque Revival, Byzantine Revival, and Gothic Revival architecture. The walls are made of reinforced concrete, while the roof is made of slate. The building was constructed between 1935 and 1937 and consecrated in 1938.
St. James was the first Anglican parish in Vancouver, formerly Granville, until the establishment of Christ Church (local church), a daughter church, in 1888 that in 1929 became Christ Church Cathedral - the Diocese's second cathedral.

176,Sylvia Hotel,"The Sylvia Hotel is a historic Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada landmark. Located at 1154 Gilford Street on English Bay near Stanley Park. Constructed in 1912, the Sylvia was designed as an apartment building by Mr. W.P. White, a Seattle architect. It was built by Booker, Campbell and Whipple Construction Company for a Mr. Goldstein, who had a daughter named Sylvia. During the Depression the Sylvia Court Apartments fell on hard times, and in 1936 the building was converted into an apartment hotel. With the advent of World War II, many of the suites were converted to rooms, to provide accommodation for crews of the merchant marine.
After the war the number of permanent residents in the hotel gradually decreased, until by the sixties the Sylvia had become a completely transient full-service hotel. In 1954 it opened the first cocktail bar in Vancouver. Until 1958 the Sylvia Hotel was the tallest building in the West End – a well-known landmark, its brick and terracotta extension softened by the Virginia creeper that now completely covers the Gilford Street side of the hotel.  Until superseded by the West-End building boom of the 1960s, the hotel restaurant's slogan was ""Dine in the Sky"". 
In 1975 the Sylvia was designated by the City of Vancouver as a ""heritage building"", thereby ensuring its survival for many years to come. 
The famous Sylvia Hotel cat, ""Mr. Got To Go"", has inspired three popular children's books by Lois Simmie and illustrated by Cynthia Nugent. They are engaging tales of the stray cat who arrived at the Sylvia Hotel one day, took control of the premises and decided to check in permanently.  A feline resident – possibly the same cat – is mentioned in a song about the hotel by American folk singer-songwriter Cheryl Wheeler.


== Sylvia Ablowitz ==
Sylvia Goldstein, (later Ablowitz) spent her childhood in the West End. A strong swimmer, she sometimes practised in English Bay and once won a race between the bay and Kitsilano Beach. (Later, she would attract the attention of her future husband, Harry Ablowitz, by diving into False Creek from a boat carrying Jewish singles on an outing.) After Sylvia completed a degree at the University of British Columbia, her family moved to Los Angeles, where she worked for a labour union. She returned to Vancouver in 1928, and met Harry, marrying him within a year and settling in North Vancouver. Together, they founded a realty company.
Sylvia and her husband were very committed to Jewish seniors. Sylvia worked with Jewish community groups, and she and Harry helped set up a rest home and hospital, now in operation for nearly 60 years. In her 90s, Sylvia was still volunteering for a telephone home-check program to help out other senior Jews. She died on April 12, 2002 at the University of British Columbia Hospital.

177,9 O'Clock Gun,"The 9 O'Clock Gun is a cannon located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, that is ordinarily fired daily at 21:00 (9 p.m.) PT.
The gun is a 12-pound muzzle-loaded naval cannon, cast in Woolwich, England in 1816. The crests of King George III and Henry Phipps, 1st Earl of Mulgrave, Master-General of the Ordnance at the time the cannon was cast, are on the barrel. Seventy-eight years later, in about 1894, it was brought to Stanley Park by the Department of Marine and Fisheries to warn fishermen of the 18:00 Sunday close of fishing. On October 15, 1898, the gun was fired for the first time in Stanley Park at noon.
The 21:00 firing was later established as a time signal for the general population and to allow the chronometers of ships in port to be accurately set.  The Brockton Point lighthouse keeper, William D. Jones, originally detonated a stick of dynamite over the water until the cannon was installed. The cannon is now activated automatically with an electronic trigger which was installed by the Parks Board electrical department. It is still loaded daily with a black powder charge. The fluorescent lights illuminating the gun from overhead go out exactly ten seconds before it fires, and turn back on a few seconds afterward.
The gun was restored and sheltered by a new pavilion designed by architect Gregory Henriquez in 1986 and built as a centennial gift to the city from Ebco Industries, Chester Millar, First Generation Capital, and the Hudson's Bay Company.In the past there was a Texaco floating gas station permanently anchored in line with the gun and Monday May 18, 1964 someone was able to toss rocks from the beach below into the barrel which then perforated the 'O' in the large illuminated sign above the barge.  The barge was moved slightly after that event.
At noon on Canada Day (1 July), three additional cannons were added to the sea wall just to the West of the 9 O'Clock Gun. These three cannons each fired seven times, resulting in a 21 gun salute.
The 9 O'Clock Gun has had its own Twitter Parody Account since May 21, 2012, in which it tweets ""BOOM!"" every day at the time of firing.


== Timings ==
The clock used to time the firing of the gun runs slightly fast, such that towards the end of each year, the gun fires up to 50 seconds before 9pm. At New Year's Day, the clock seems to be reset, and the gun goes off at 9pm again.The 9 O'Clock Gun has been silent for several periods: once during World War II, in 1969 when it was stolen and held by University of British Columbia Engineering students until a ""ransom"" was donated to BC Children's Hospital, in 2007 during a work stoppage, in 2008 when UBC Engineering students painted it red, and on 20th May 2011, 22nd July, 2017, 26th July, 2017, 8th August, 2019, 7th October, 2019, 17th November 2019, 26th November 2019 with no explanation. After the 1969 theft, the cannon was surrounded by a stone and metal enclosure as shown in the photo.
From 30th March to 30th April 2020, the gun was set to fire at 19:00 (7 p.m.), in support of local health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the 9 O'Clock Gun continued to be fired at 7 p.m. until 31st July 2020, when it was switched back to its eponymous 9pm time.
From 4th October 2020, the cannon started firing at 10pm. This is likely due to its clock incorrectly being moved back an hour; a month earlier than PDT actually ends.

178,Vanier Park,"Vanier Park is a municipal park located in the Kitsilano neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, created in 1967. It is home to the Museum of Vancouver, the Vancouver Maritime Museum, the City of Vancouver Archives, and the H.R. MacMillan Space Centre. It is also the site of the ancestral Squamish settlement of Sen̓áḵw, which was destroyed by the Provincial government 54 years earlier.


== History ==

The Squamish had an ancestral fishing ground on the site.  In the mid-1800s, they established a more permanent village site there named Sen̓áḵw. During the Royal Engineer’s Survey of 1869, it was designated as ""Indian Reserve No. 6"". Sen̓áḵw encompassed 80 acres, and included Vanier Park. In 1877, chief August Jack Khatsahlano, after whom the Kitsilano neighbourhood was named, was born at Sen̓áḵw.The Canadian Pacific Railway, the Province and the City of Vancouver worked together to displace the Squamish inhabitants, with the City calling the settlement ""a source of menace to the morals and health of the City"". In 1913, the BC Government under Richard McBride expropriated the site, paying the inhabitants a fraction of the land's value, and giving them two days to leave before burning their homes to the ground. The land was acquired from the Province by the Federal government in 1928. Around the time of the second world war, the site was home to Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) station, Number 2 Equipment Depot. On October 28, 1966, it was turned over to the Vancouver Park Board by the Federal Government. Named for former Governor General of Canada Georges Vanier, the park officially opened on May 30, 1967. The H.R. MacMillan Space Centre and the Vancouver Museum complex opened in 1968, thanks to lumber baron MacMillan’s $1.5 million donation.Deputy Park Board Superintendent William Livingstone, famous for his landscape design for Queen Elizabeth Park and VanDusen Botanical Garden, increased the size of the original park site using tons of free fill from the excavation for the MacMillan Bloedel Building on Georgia Street. The fill added additional acres onto the park which was then landscaped by Livingstone and his crew.


== Attractions ==
Vanier Park plays host to several of Vancouver’s biggest summer festivals, including the International Children’s Festival and the Shakespearean Bard on the Beach. It is the biggest and most famous of the fifteen parks in Kitsilano.

179,Statue of Harry Jerome,"Harry Jerome is an outdoor 1986 bronze sculpture by Jack Harman of Canadian track and field runner Harry Jerome, installed at Stanley Park in Vancouver, British Columbia.


== Description ==
The 9-foot (2.7 m) statue commemorates Jerome's running career and depicts the sprinter with his ""chest thrust forward into the finish tape"".


== History ==
The sculpture was unveiled in 1988. Someone placed an Iron Man helmet on the statue without permission in 2015; reports attributed the helmet to mischief or a guerrilla marketing campaign for the pending premiere of Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron. The statue's plaque was stolen in 2016. Toronto artist Moya Garrison-Msingwana's 2019 Google Doodle commemorating Jerome's birthday was ""loosely inspired"" by the statue.

The mural was unveiled on October 2, 2010, by the Mayor of the City of Vancouver, Gregor Robertson. as part of the celebration of the 125 years of Vancouver's Chinatown. The mural is featured in multiple lists of notable Vancouver murals.It was designed by Kenson Seto and painted by Alex Li & Falk. The mural is 223 square metres, and cost $18,000   which was split between the City of Vancouver and Lee's Association of Vancouver. It was defaced multiple times by graffiti, causing outrage in the community.On April 5, 2016, the City of Vancouver rezoned the lot at 303 E Pender St/450 Gore Avenue, allowing construction of a six story building  that hid the mural from sight. The building, marketed as Brixton Flats  was designed by architect Gair Williamson and developed by GMC Projects Inc., whose website features an image of the Laozi mural 
Vancouver City Council added a condition to the rezoning: ""Design development to create a new mural to reflect the character and history of Chinatown;Note to Applicant: The intent is not to recreate the existing mural, but rather to seek a viable opportunity to create a new mural of a suitable size and location on the building, including possible location on the eastern side of the building.""The developer is studying the possibility of painting a smaller version of the original mural on the new building.

181,Vancouver Fringe Festival,"The Vancouver Fringe Festival is an annual alternative theatre festival held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada established in 1985. The event is organized and sponsored by the First Vancouver Theatrespace Society, a volunteer not-for-profit society. The festival is usually staged in September at a number of venues around the city. The most recent festival ran from September 6-16, 2018.


== History ==
The first Vancouver Fringe Festival was held in 1985. It was centred in Mount Pleasant and held its opening ceremonies in the parking lot of an IGA. The 220 performances were held in seven venues with 4,000 people in attendance—and only 25 volunteers helping out. Anchor venues in Mount Pleasant included the Western Front, Heritage Hall, and later, for the Fringe Bar, the Mount Pleasant Legion.In 1995, the festival relocated to Commercial Drive. The Fringe’s first home on the Drive was above the novelty shop where Havana Restaurant is located today. Known as the Production Palace, it was a hub for staff, volunteers, and others. At that time, the festival introduced ""bring your own venue"", in which performers stage performances at places other than those provided by the festival organizers.By 2001, the Fringe was primarily centralized on Granville Island. Its opening ceremony that year included a parade around the Island that went against the flow of one way traffic.The 2012 festival saw an improvised musical based on the works of William Shakespeare. Increased professional standards have resulted in the Fringe introducing programs such as its ""Dramatic Works Series"".The Fringe employs an “everyone is welcome” selection technique—the Mainstage shows are literally drawn out of a hat, giving all artists, from novice to veteran, a chance to participate. Vancouver Fringe Festival Mainstage shows feature some of Vancouver’s best venues including the Revue Stage, Performance Works, and the Waterfront Theatre, all situated on and around Granville Island. The Bring Your Own Venue (BYOV) category allows artists to stage original work in unconventional places. The Fringe strives to break down traditional boundaries and encourage open dialogue between audiences and artists by presenting live un-juried, uncensored theatre in an accessible and informal environment. All artists receive 100% of regular box office revenues generated during the Festival.


== Theatre Wire ==
Theatre Wire is a new initiative from the Vancouver Fringe Theatre Society, who also produce the Vancouver Fringe Festival.
Theatre Wire was created to facilitate connections between all the smaller theatre companies in Vancouver. Theatre Wire is a one-stop shop for independent theatre happenings.

182,"Hogan's Alley, Vancouver","Hogan's Alley was the local, unofficial name for Park Lane, an alley that ran through the southwestern corner of Strathcona in Vancouver, British Columbia during the first six decades of the twentieth century. It ran between Union and Prior Streets from approximately Main Street to Jackson Avenue.
While Hogan's Alley and the surrounding area was an ethnically diverse neighbourhood during this era, home to many Italian, Chinese and Japanese Canadians, this was home to a number of black families, black businesses, and the city's only black church, the African Methodist Episcopal Fountain Chapel. As such, Hogan's Alley was the first and last neighbourhood in Vancouver with a substantial concentrated black population. A possible reason these families settled there was because of the close proximity to the train stations since sleeping car porters were predominantly black men. A 1957 study by the City of Vancouver Planning Department described the black population of Strathcona as such: ""The Negro population, while numerically small, is probably a large proportion of the total Negro population in Vancouver. Their choice of this area is partly its proximity to the railroads where many of them are employed, partly its cheapness and partly the fact that it is traditionally the home of many non-white groups.""Prior to 1935, Hogan's Alley was a red light district, owing to Mayor L. D. Taylor's ""open town policy,"" which was that police resources would be concentrated on major crimes, not victimless vice crimes. As a result of this policy, illegal drinking establishments, brothels, and gambling dens operated here, as they did in various other non-white sections of town like Chinatown and Japantown, but also in non-ethnically defined areas nearby such as Gastown, East Hastings and lower Mount Pleasant. This policy also earned Taylor a reputation for being soft on vice crime and he faced accusations of corruption. This was the basis of his electoral defeats in 1929 and 1934. Hogan's Alley long outlived Taylor's career in civic politics until it faced demolition to make way for a freeway.Most of Hogan's Alley was destroyed circa 1970 by the Non-Partisan Association civic government's construction of the Georgia Viaduct, the first phase of a planned interurban freeway originally through Hogan's Alley and much of Chinatown and Gastown. The freeway was stopped by an alliance of Strathcona community activists and Chinatown businesspeople.  The freeway was blocked, and Strathcona, Chinatown and Gastown were saved from the wrecker's ball, but not before Hogan's Alley was mostly demolished. Today, the block or so that is left of the alley itself bears little to no mark that there was ever a black presence there, and is an indistinct part of Strathcona facing an empty lot adjacent to the busy Main Street on-ramps to the viaduct.
One remaining landmark that suggests a black community was active in the Strathcona neighbourhood during the first six decades of the twentieth century is the Jimi Hendrix Shrine. The shrine, located on the corner of Union and Main, was created to celebrate the connection between Hendrix and Vancouver. Nora Hendrix, born in Knoxville, Tennessee and grandmother to the late musician, migrated to Vancouver in 1911 and lived in and around Hogan's Alley.The alley was recreated in virtual form in the 2014 interactive work Circa 1948.The alley was mentioned in the 2014 poem ""A Love Letter or Considering Reconciliation in Canada"" by Juliane Okot Bitek.

183,Main Street–Science World station,"Main Street–Science World (formerly Main Street) is an elevated station on the Expo Line of Metro Vancouver's SkyTrain rapid transit system in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The station is accessible from both sides of Main Street at the intersection of Main Street and Terminal Avenue and is adjacent to Pacific Central Station, the city's inter-city railway and bus terminal.


== History ==
Prior to SkyTrain's opening, the station served as the western terminus of a short 1-kilometre (0.62 mi) demonstration track during the summer of 1983. A single two-car prototype train ran both eastbound and westbound on the current westbound track, between the station and what was at that time the end of the completed guideway, at the eastern end of the centre median of Terminal Avenue.

In December 1985, SkyTrain began service with the station opening as ""Main Street station"". It was one of two stations that served the Expo 86 site, the other being Stadium station. This station served as an access point to the east gate of Expo 86. It was also the first elevated SkyTrain station to have buildings built around and above it, as seen with the Vancity tower on the west side of the station.
Once Expo 86 had ended, many of its buildings were either torn down or removed. One of the few to remain was the nearby geodesic dome, known during the fair as ""Expo Centre"", and now one of the city's most recognizable landmarks. A science museum known as Science World subsequently moved into that space and, on September 21, 1990, the station's name was hyphenated, becoming ""Main Street–Science World"" due to its proximity to the popular landmark attraction one block away. Older signage referred to the station as ""Science World–Main Street"".
As part of a plan to upgrade high-traffic stations along the Expo Line, and to enable the addition of fare gates to the station in conjunction with the broader system-wide Compass smartcard initiative, construction began on a major refurbishment of Main Street–Science World in early 2013. In 2014, due to ongoing construction, the platform length was shortened, preventing four- and six-car trains from stopping at the station. As a result, TransLink introduced the Train2Main service, which consisted of a two-car shuttle train that served the station and ran between Waterfront and Commercial–Broadway stations, with longer trains skipping Main Street–Science World during this period. This service ran between March 30 and December 6, 2014.On May 18, 2014, the new east stationhouse opened. Simultaneously, the west stationhouse closed for renovations. Construction work on the west stationhouse was completed on February 5, 2016, and resulted in improved accessibility, passenger safety, and lighting, along with the addition of fare gates months after they had launched at most other stations in the system.


== Services ==
The Main Street–Science World station is a major connection point for the TransLink Main Street trolley bus routes, as well as for the Via Rail and Amtrak trains that arrive and depart from the nearby Pacific Central station
The eastern terminus of the defunct Downtown Historic Railway was located near this station; that line's streetcars ran westbound along the south side of False Creek to Granville Island.
The eastern terminus of both False Creek Ferries and the Aquabus can also be found nearby just south of Science World.
Three restaurants are located within the station complex: Starbucks, A&W, and Tim Hortons. Prior to the opening of Starbucks in the original station house, the same space was occupied by ""The Exchange""—a small newspaper/snack outlet that opened in 1986 as part of a retail programme initially set up with the introduction of SkyTrain.

184,Gate to the Northwest Passage,"Gate to the Northwest Passage is a 1980 sculpture by Alan Chung Hung, located adjacent to the Vancouver Maritime Museum in Vanier Park in the Kitsilano neighborhood of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The 4.6-metre (15 ft) sculpture of a square, cut and twisted ""like a paper clip"" to form an arch, is composed of weathered Corten steel that rusts to provide a protective layer. The work was installed in 1980 to commemorate the arrival of Captain George Vancouver in Burrard Inlet, following a competition sponsored by Parks Canada one year prior. Gate to the Northwest Passage received an adverse reaction initially, but reception has improved over time. The sculpture has been included in walking tours of the surrounding neighborhoods as a highlight of Vanier Park.


== Background ==
Gate to the Northwest Passage was designed by Alan Chung Hung (1946–1994), who was born in Canton, China, moved to Vancouver in 1969, and studied at the Vancouver School of Art. Chung Hung's other works displayed in Vancouver include Spring (1981) and Clouds (1991).

In 1979, Parks Canada sponsored a competition for a permanent work to commemorate Captain George Vancouver, the first European to enter Burrard Inlet, in 1792. Guidelines for the competition required the use of permanent materials other than wood and that the work should ""not be in the likeness of a man"". Hugh Faulkner, Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development during 1977–1979, offered the opportunity for the sculpture, and the project was recommended by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. Gate to the Northwest Passage was selected by a five-person jury, led by former parks superintendent Stuart Lefeaux, then confirmed by the Parks Board. The work was originally to be installed at Stanley Park's Ferguson Point, but was sited in Vanier Park adjacent to the Vancouver Maritime Museum in 1980.The 4.6-metre (15 ft) sculpture of a square, cut and twisted ""like a paper clip"" to form an arch, is composed of weathered Corten steel. Each of the square's sides measure 0.9 metres (3.0 ft) x 0.9 metres (3.0 ft). The Corten steel rusts, forming a protective layer at the surface. The work, sited on a plaza of paving stones that measures 7.9 metres (26 ft) x 8.5 metres (28 ft), frames views of English Bay, the North Shore Mountains and the city. In their guide for public art in Vancouver, John Steil and Aileen Stalker suggested two sources for the sculpture's design: Chung Hung's training as a civil engineer, and the shapes of plane tables and quadrants, both navigational instruments used by George Vancouver. According to Chung Hung: ""The objective of the sculpture is to create a symbolic image with definite visual expression, awakening an awareness in Captain George Vancouver's contribution to the world, his remarkable and meticulous surveys which included the north Pacific coast."" The sculpture is owned by the City of Vancouver, with Parks Canada serving as the sponsoring organization.


== Reception ==

According to the City of Vancouver Public Art Registry, Gate to the Northwest Passage initially received an adverse reaction from local residents. Michael Duncan, then chief curator of the Vancouver Maritime Museum, called it ""a bloody monstrosity"". One member of the five-person jury responded to the criticism: ""If people think Hung's sculpture is a poor catch, they should have seen the ones that got away.""A 1983 article published in The Globe and Mail referred to the sculpture as the ""world's largest paper clip"". The same article included a statement from the city planning study: ""Vancouver's peerless natural setting is a permanent gift from nature. So massive and close are the North Shore mountains that no amount of human folly can ever obliterate them.""
Reception of the work, which has become a familiar landmark, has improved over time. One travel guide by Eyewitness Books referred to Gate to the Northwest Passage as an ""imposing giant red steel"" sculpture. Frommer's includes  the sculpture in walking tours for Vancouver as a highlight of Vanier Park.
In 2006, the work was mentioned in a Sunday serial thriller for The Province by author Daniel Kalla. In the series, the sculpture is described as a ""massive Greek letter pi"", and later a character is found dead, hanging from the sculpture.

185,Museum of Vancouver,"The Museum of Vancouver (MOV) (formerly the Vancouver Museum and prior to that the Centennial Museum) is a civic history museum located in Vanier Park, Vancouver, British Columbia. The MOV is the largest civic museum in Canada and the oldest museum in Vancouver. The museum was founded in 1894 and went through a number of iterations before being rebranded as the Museum of Vancouver in 2009.  It creates Vancouver-focused exhibitions and programs that encourage conversations about what was, is, and can be Vancouver.  It shares an entrance and foyer with the H. R. MacMillan Space Centre but the MOV is much larger and occupies the vast majority of the space in the building complex where both organisations sit as well as separate collections storage facilities in another building.


== History ==
The museum was founded by the Art, Historical, and Scientific Association of Vancouver (AHSA), which formed on April 17, 1894, with the objective of cultivating ""a taste for the beauties and refinements in life."" Shortly after its inaugural meeting the AHSA opened its first temporary exhibition ('Paintings and Curiosities') in rented premises on the top floor of the Dunn Building on Granville Street, Vancouver.  This exhibition triggered a series of donations to the new museum's collections which were mostly natural history or ethnographic in origin.  The first recorded donation to the collection was of taxidermy - a stuffed Trumpeter Swan which was donated by Mr Sydney Williams in 1895. Regular purchasing of artefacts for the collections of the AHSA began in 1898 and acquisitions were eclectic and multi-disciplinary reflecting the interests of the decision-makers rather than any strategic approach to collecting.

As the collection grew the question was raised as to a permanent place to display it and following discussions with the Vancouver City Council agreement was reached on August 26, 1903 that title to the museum collection would pass to the Council in exchange for the provision of suitable and convenient premises where they could be displayed.  It was agreed at the same time that the new museum would be located on the top floor of the new Carnegie Library. The museum opened at this location on April 19, 1905.Between 1915 and 1925 the museum and the AHSA attempted to establish in Stanley Park a reconstructed First Nations village built around a series of major totem and house poles that had been acquired by the AHSA.  This project ultimately failed but it did result in the current display of totem poles in Stanley Park which remain one of the most photographed tourist attractions in Vancouver.In 1930 the museum sponsored an extensive series of archaeological excavations of the Marpole Midden which was one of the most important archaeological sites on the Pacific Northwest Coast but was also an unceded ancestral territory of the Musqueam First Nation and was where the village of c̓əsnaʔəm (Musqueam Marpole Village Site) had been located.  The outcome of this has been dealt with in the award-winning exhibition c̓əsnaʔəm, the city before the city, a joint project between the Musqueam Indian Band, the Museum of Vancouver and the Museum of Anthropology.
In 1957 the public library which shared the Carnegie building with the museum moved to a new dedicated building in Burrard Street tripling the available storage and display space for the museum and in 1959 the museum was incorporated into the City Council and became a city department under the control of a Civic Museum Board.  A report was commissioned on the future of the museum (the Heinrich Report of 1965) and this recommended the building of a new museum on the south shore of False Creek near the Burrard Bridge.  Federal and provincial money was made available for the 1967 Confederation Centennial celebrations and the current building was constructed which opened to the public in October 1968. From the opening of the new museum building to 1981, the museum was branded as Centennial Museum; before reverting its name back to Vancouver Museum.
In 1972 the city council relinquished its control of the museum and a joint Museum and Planetarium Association was formed as a descendant of the original AHSA which founded the museum. In 1977 the museum was designated a Category A cultural institution by the federal government and named in the Cultural Property Export and Import Act.
In 2009, the museum was re-branded as the Museum of Vancouver, in an attempt to reflect its changed focus to Vancouver rather than the lower mainland region of British Columbia as originally set out in its objectives and reaffirmed in 1977.


== Building ==

The building is located at 1100 Chestnut Street in Vanier Park, in the neighbourhood of Kitsilano in Vancouver, BC. The museum is situated at the south end of Vanier Park, with the park acting as a connecting greenspace between the Vancouver Maritime Museum, Bard on the Beach, the Vancouver Archives, and the Vancouver Academy of Music.
The building was constructed in 1967 to a design by the architect Gerald Hamilton who had studied at Leeds University before moving to Vancouver in 1950. Hamilton was a practitioner of the New Formalism school of architecture and its most visible proponent in Vancouver at the time.
Originally, the building was planned to only house a museum, but a generous gift by the lumber magnate H.R. MacMillan allowed the architect to incorporate a planetarium into the design. As a result, the distinctive roof was added, designed to reflect the shape of a woven basket hat made by Northwest Coast First Nations people.  This decision has created ongoing confusion over the identity of the building as many people associate it mistakenly as only a planetarium whereas the vast majority of the building space is occupied by the galleries of the Museum of Vancouver and the planetarium part was renamed the H.R. MacMillan Space Centre in the late 1990s.
The building was officially dedicated on May 20, 1967 and the ceremony was attended by Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra, who was the granddaughter of Queen Mary and King George V and also a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II.
Alex Bozikovic remarks that the building closesly resembles the John Nugent Studio designed by Saskatchewan architect Clifford Wiens built six years earlier..  The building is considered iconic by Vancouverites and is one of the most immediately recognisable buildings in Vancouver. It was nicknamed 'the Taj Mahal on the creek' when first built and is characterised by its sweeping conical shape and reflecting pools crossed by curved pedestrian bridges.


== Collection ==
The museum has a large collection of objects which reflect to a large extent the interests of the donors and of the curators who made decisions on acquisitions over the years in a similar way to many museums that were established in this way.  The collection is nationally significant but much of it remains in storage due to a lack of exhibition space.
The collection includes the First Nations and Oriental artefacts that were collected by Mary Lipsett who established along with her husband the Lipsett Indian Museum which opened in a former aquarium in the PNE grounds in 1941.  This collection was said to be the finest in Canada when reported on by the Vancouver Sun in 1948 and Mary Lipsett was well-respected for her positive relationship with the First Nations and was honoured with the Kwawlewith name 'Ha-wini-po-la-o-gua', which means “a matriarch to whom many come for good counsel.”  She donated the entire collection to the then Vancouver Museum and it remains in storage there.
Particular strengths in the MOV collection include:


=== Ethnology ===
One of the most significant Pacific Northwest Coast First Nations collections in Canada with assemblages such as:


=== Asian antiquities ===
These include collections such as:


=== Egyptian antiquities ===
These include:

Ancient Egyptian collection, especially mummified boy (previously nicknamed 'Diana') discovered one mile from the Valley of the Kings near Luxor in 1915.  The mummy wrappings are inscribed ""Penechates, son of Hatres"" and it probably dates  from the 1st to the 3rd century CE
Mummified crocodiles, hawk and cats
Material excavated by Sir Flinders Petrie who was a member of the Vancouver Museum Board in 1934


=== History of Vancouver ===
These include objects such as:


== Galleries ==

The museum has a number of permanent galleries that cover the entire history of Vancouver in an experience which includes sound and film. In addition to the historical permanent galleries, permanent galleries at the Museum of Vancouver include:

While most of these galleries explore the history of Vancouver during its specified time period, the Neon Vancouver gallery features a collection of neon signs that were used in Vancouver from the 1950s to 1970s.Along with its permanent galleries, the Museum of Vancouver typically hosts a number of temporary exhibitions. Three temporary exhibitions are presently held at the museum. The c̓əsnaʔəm, the city before the city exhibition was developed in partnership with the Musqueam Indian Band, with plans to remain at the museum from January 2015 to January 2021. The second exhibition, HAIDA NOW: A Visual Feast of Innovation and Tradition opened at the museum in March 2018, and will continue to be held there until June 2021. The museum's most recent exhibition, Acts of Resistance, opened on February 5, 2020 and runs until December 2020.

186,"Japantown, Vancouver","Japantown, Little Tokyo or Paueru-gai (パウエル街, lit. ""Powell Street"") is an old neighbourhood in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, located east of Gastown and north of Chinatown, that once had a concentration of Japanese immigrants.
Japantown ceased to be a distinct Japanese ethnic area during World War II when Japanese Canadians had their property confiscated and  were interned (see Japanese Canadian internment). Although some Japanese returned after the war, the community never revived to its original state as the properties of Japanese Canadians were permanently forfeited by the Canadian government. As the Japantown ceased to exist, area is often referred and marketed as Railtown by real estate developers.


== History ==
Japantown was attacked on 7 September 1907 by the Asiatic Exclusion League, which smashed many windows in parts of Chinatown, and then moved on to Japantown. Japantown received warning of the attacks, and though residents resisted the Asiatic Exclusion League members, considerable damage was done. The centenary of the attacks were marked by a Riot Walk through Chinatown and Japantown on 7 September 2007.During World War II, Japanese Canadians had their property confiscated and were sent to internment camps and prisoner of war camps (see Japanese Canadian internment) and Japantown ceased to be a distinct Japanese ethnic area. Although some Japanese returned to the area after the war, the community never revived as the properties confiscated by the Canadian government were never returned. The area is now part of Strathcona in Downtown Eastside and the area is informally known as Railtown.
Along Powell Street, a few remnants of the former Japanese neighbourhood still exist. The Vancouver Buddhist Church, formerly the Japanese Methodist Church, still exists at 220 Jackson Avenue at Powell, as does the Vancouver Japanese Language School and Japanese Hall at 475 and 487 Alexander Street at Jackson, which is the only property in Canada that was ever returned to the Japanese Canadians after the World War II. Until the boom in Japanese restaurants in the 1980s, two restaurants on Powell Street were among the only Japanese dining establishments in the city.


== Oppenheimer Park ==
Oppenheimer Park (Powell Street Grounds) in this area was the home for Asahi baseball team and it is the site for the annual two-day Powell Street Festival, which began in 1977. It is held every August, in the first weekend of the month, and is a community celebration of Japanese heritage as well as the alternative and street culture of the Downtown Eastside.


== Little Ginza ==
An upscale enclave of ethnic Japanese retailers and restaurants known as the Little Ginza - has developed on Alberni Street near Burrard Street in the slim boundary area between the West End and the Financial District in Downtown Vancouver.
The new enclave has been gaining momentum over the course of the last forty years with an increasing number of high-end restaurants, dance clubs, karaoke bars, shops, and upscale boutiques. These venues are largely geared to the usual tourists that frequent the city as well as the travelling Japanese in search of ""bargain""-priced designer goods (relative to prices in Tokyo or Osaka), and for omiyage (obligatory gifts to be given on return to Japan).

188,Olympic Village station,"Olympic Village is an underground station on the Canada Line of Metro Vancouver's SkyTrain rapid transit system. The station is located at the intersection of Cambie Street and West 2nd Avenue, adjacent to the Cambie Street Bridge in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. 
The station is located in the Fairview neighbourhood and serves the South False Creek residential and commercial areas, which included the Olympic Village built for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The use of the term ""Olympic"" was licensed for use by the International Olympic Committee.


== History ==

During the planning and approval process for the Canada Line, Olympic Village station was initially intended for completion along with the rest of the line. When the cost of the project had to be scaled back by TransLink (circa 2005), the station was deferred until after the opening of the Canada Line; however, the City of Vancouver owned the station site and decided to fund the station's construction to spur redevelopment of its lands and the nearby Southeast False Creek neighbourhood, and the station's construction was restored to the initial phase.
The station opened in 2009 and was designed by the architecture firm VIA Architecture. ""Olympic Village"" is the third name for this station: its original proposed names were ""2nd Avenue"" and later ""False Creek South"".


== Services ==
Olympic Village is within a short walk of the False Creek Ferries and Aquabus ferry stop at Spyglass and Stamp's Landing. Both companies provide service to Granville Island, David Lam Park, Yaletown, Plaza of Nations and Science World, while False Creek Ferries provides service to Kitsilano and the West End.
The station was within walking distance of Leg-In-Boot station on the Vancouver Downtown Historic Railway, a tram service that operated on weekends from 1998 to 2011, connecting Science World and Main Street–Science World station to Granville Island. The Downtown Historic Railway is currently not operating due to financial constraints.During the 2010 Winter Olympics, the Olympic Line, a temporary streetcar demonstration service, operated on the Downtown Historic Railway between Olympic Village station and Granville Island.


== Station information ==

189,Chehalis Cross,"The Chehalis Cross, or Chehalis Monument, is a Celtic cross memorial commemorating the eight people who died when the tugboat Chehalis sank off Stanley Park. The monument is installed west of Brockton Point in Vancouver, British Columbia.


== Sinking of the Chehalis ==
The 59.3 ft wooden steam ship Chehalis, owned by the Union S.S. Company of Vancouver, sank at about 2 p.m. July 21, 1906 killing 8 of the 15 people onboard, following a collision with the Canadian Pacific Railway's Princess Victoria, a 300 ft steam ship. The seven survivors were rescued by the keeper of the nearby Brockton Point lighthouse.The Chehalis had been chartered to carry passengers to British Columbia's north coast and had just embarked from North Vancouver in fine weather, passing Brockton Point while heading out of Burrard Inlet. The Princess Victoria embarked from the Canadian Pacific Railway dock in Vancouver carrying 219 passengers. The Princess Victoria corrected its course for a small launch before running over the Chehalis. The official investigation blamed the Princess Victoria for the collision.

Inside the building, there are live demonstrations on science in the GroundStation Canada Theatre, exhibits and games in the Cosmic Courtyard, and shows about astronomy in the Planetarium Star Theatre. Next to the building is the Gordon MacMillan Southam Observatory. This centre of astronomy is a popular attraction in Vancouver.
The Space Centre is named for H. R. MacMillan, a British Columbia industrialist and philanthropist.  The building was designed in the 1960s by architect Gerald Hamilton  to house what was then called The Centennial Museum. The planetarium was added as part of a pre-construction re-design. Outside the museum is a sculpture by George Norris called The Crab. Norris's sculpture won a 1967 design competition. The Space Centre originated as the H.R. MacMillan Planetarium until its re-branding in the 1990s when it expanded to include exhibit space into one of the wings of the building it shares with the Museum of Vancouver. The facility was refurbished and renovated to include the Space Centre exhibit space in 1997-98 by Matsuzaki Wright Architects.

191,Hastings Mill,"Hastings Mill was a sawmill on the south shore of Burrard Inlet and was the first commercial operation around which the settlement that would become Vancouver developed in British Columbia, Canada. Founded in 1865 by Edward Stamp, the sawmill operated until its closure in 1928.
The store building of Hastings Mills was moved to Alma Street in 1930, situated within present day Hastings Mill Park. The store building was dedicated as the Old Hastings Mill Store Museum in 1932, and houses exhibits that showcase artifacts and items of significance to Vancouver's history. 


== History ==

In 1867, Captain Edward Stamp began producing lumber in Stamp's Mill at the foot of what is now Dunlevy Avenue after a planned site at Brockton Point proved unsuitable due to difficult currents and a shoal. Stamp's efforts in developing the mill are summarized by Robert Macdonald in Making Vancouver: Class, Status and Social Boundaries, 1863-1913:

    In 1865 he formed a company in England, backed by capital of $100,000 , to produce lumber in British Columbia. Stamp also secured from the colonial government of British Columbia the right to purchase or lease 16,000 acres (65 km2) of timber on the lower coast, and selected a mill site on a point of land along Burrard Inlet's south shore. Delayed by the failure of crucial machinery parts to arrive from England, Stamp did not begin cutting lumber for export until June 1867. After managing the firm for less than two years he retired, and shortly thereafter his company went into liquidation in England. The mill closed for a period in 1870 but opened again in August after being purchased by Dickson, DeWolf and Company of San Francisco. Known at first as Stamp's Mill, it now became the Hastings Sawmill Company, or Hastings Mill.

The early settlement was in effect a company town. People shopped at the Hastings Mill Store and sent their children to the Hastings Mill School, which included students from Moodyville on the opposite side of the inlet. This would change after the Canadian Pacific Railway chose Vancouver as the terminus for the transcontinental railway. Nevertheless, the lumber industry remained the backbone of the new settlement's economy, and Hastings Mill was ""the nucleus around which the city of Vancouver grew up in the 1880s"" and remained important to the local economy until it closed in 1928.


=== Museum ===

After Hastings Mill closed, the building that housed the Hastings Mill store was transported by barge to the foot of Alma Street in 1930. The building was official reopened in 1931, and was dedicated as the Museum of B.C. Historical Relics in Memory of the Pioneers, or the Old Hastings Mill Store Museum in 1932. Operated by the Native Daughters of British Columbia, the museum features artifacts and curios from Vancouver's past, and First Nations art.Built in 1865, the museum building is the oldest building in Vancouver. The building was one of the only structures to survive the Great Vancouver Fire in 1886, and was used as a hospital and morgue for the fire's victims.

193,Oppenheimer Park,"Oppenheimer Park is a park located in the historic Japantown in Downtown Eastside, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. During the late 2010s it was the site of a large homeless encampment.


== History ==
Opened in 1902 as the Powell Street Grounds by Vancouver's second mayor, David Oppenheimer; it was later renamed in honour of the mayor, not after J. Robert Oppenheimer who worked on the Manhattan Project to develop the Nuclear Bomb, specifically the 2 that were dropped on Japan during World War II. The park is bounded by Jackson Ave, Dunlevy Ave, Powell St and East Cordova St. Oppenheimer Park's facilities include a softball field, a basketball hoop, a children's playground, and a community centre with bathrooms, meeting space, and public computer access. The park employs two full-time activity coordinators and several part-time staff.The Asahi baseball team used Oppenheimer Park as its home field prior to World War II, although it is most notable historically as being the site of one of the large demonstrations of striking workers during the events of Bloody Sunday in 1938. The park remained a popular family destination until the late 1980s when crack cocaine trade and abuse began to dominate the park's usage.
Since 2004, initiatives by the Vancouver Police and the Strathcona Business Improvement Association have attempted to return the park to its original image of safe recreation, with some success. The park was upgraded in 2010 with reconfiguration of the pathways and additions of a playground, a basketball hoop and a new field house.


== First Nations protest ==
In July 2014, members of the First Nations community occupied Oppenheimer Park by creating a makeshift tent city, in protest of the city of Vancouver's attempt to evict homeless people that had been living in the park. Protesters cited the fact that Vancouver, including its parkland, is unceded First Nations' land and the B.C. Supreme Court decision in 2009, which stated that homeless persons are allowed to camp in a public park if no alternative shelters are available.The protesters and campers were given deadline to vacate the park on October 15, 2014 after injunction was granted to the Vancouver Park Board to evict the protesters from the site. Over 100 tents remained at the park after the deadline, but the protesters and campers were removed from park and five people were arrested on October 16, 2014 for resisting to vacate the park.

194,Pacific Central Station,"Pacific Central Station is a railway station in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which acts as the western terminus of Via Rail's cross-country The Canadian to Toronto and the northern terminus of Amtrak’s Cascades to Seattle and Portland. The station also provides intercity bus service as the main Vancouver terminal for Greyhound Lines. The station is wheelchair-accessible and is staffed with full Via services.
The Amtrak Cascades provides two daily round trips from Vancouver. One goes to Seattle, Washington; the other continues on to Portland, Oregon. Rather than stopping for an immigration inspection at the border, as happens with the Adirondack to Montreal and Maple Leaf to Toronto, Amtrak passengers go through Canadian customs at the station upon arrival. Passengers bound for the United States go through United States border preclearance prior to boarding in Vancouver.
The Rocky Mountaineer operated from Pacific Central Station until moving to the nearby Rocky Mountaineer Station in 2005; they began to use Pacific Central Station again for their new Coastal Passage route in 2013.

Pacific Central Station was dedicated on November 2, 1919, a day after the first trains began using the station. It was originally named False Creek Station and was designed by the architecture firm Pratt and Ross. The building was designated a heritage railway station in 1991.Amtrak service to the terminal was originally offered on the Pacific International from 1972 to 1981, when it ceased due to budget cuts. Cross-border service returned in 1995 with the introduction of the Mount Baker International, which was later folded into the modern-day Cascades brand.
On November 8, 2010, the Canadian government announced a CA$5.1-million plan to rebuild parts of the station, including refurbishing windows, masonry, and the roof of the building.


== Public transit ==
Pacific Central Station is immediately adjacent to Main Street–Science World station on the Expo Line of Greater Vancouver's SkyTrain rapid transit system.

195,Vancouver Academy of Music,"The  Vancouver Academy of Music (VAM) is a Canadian music conservatory located in Vancouver, British Columbia. The school was founded as the Community Music School of Greater Vancouver in 1969 through efforts made by the Vancouver Community Arts Council. The school was originally located on West 12th Ave but relocated to the Music Centre in Vanier Park in May 1976. The school officially changed its name to the Vancouver Academy of Music in 1979. The VAM currently has two divisions of study, a college division for students wanting to pursue a performance career and a preparatory division for school-age children and adults.


== History ==
When the VAM was initially founded, it only offered classes for young children in the Orff, Suzuki, and Kodály methods. In 1971 trumpeter Jerold Gerbrecht (longtime principal trumpet of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra) was brought in as music director to expand the school to include adult classes in music theory, history, composition, dance, and private instrumental and voice instruction. The school also formed an orchestra and a choir, but at this time still did not grant degrees.The Academy's program offerings continued to expand throughout the 1970s and 1980s with master classes, opera workshops, and other specialized courses. This success led the school to establish a collegiate program, the S. K. Lee College Program, in 1987 in partnership with Thompson Rivers University and the British Columbia Open University (BCOU). Students attend non-music classes at TRU and have their music courses at the Academy. Bachelor of Music degrees are awarded through the BCOU.


== Orchestras ==
The Academy has Junior, Intermediate, and Senior Symphony Orchestras. Three times a year, the Senior Academy Strings joins forces with the wind department to form the Academy Symphony Orchestra to perform at the Vancouver Orpheum Theatre. Notable conductors include the late Sidney Harth.

196,Vancouver Japanese Language School,"Vancouver Japanese Language School (バンクーバー日本語学校, Vancouver Nihongo Gakko) is a language school located in Japantown, Vancouver, BC. Founded in 1906 as Vancouver Kyoritsu Nihon Kokumin Gakko (晩香坡共立日本國民學校, Vancouver Japanese Citizens' School), it is the oldest Japanese language school in Canada.


== History ==
The school opened on January 12, 1906 as the Japanese Citizens' School, its construction having been funded by Japanese diplomat Marquis Komura Jutarō. It taught general subjects to Japanese-Canadians in the area as a full-time Japanese school following the Japanese curriculum. General subjects were dropped in 1919 in favour of teaching Japanese-Canadians both English and Japanese, and the school was renamed the Japanese Language School.After the Pacific War broke out on December 7, 1941, the school was forced to close, and Japanese-Canadians were relocated the following year as part of Japanese-Canadian internment. The school was not re-opened until 1952, when it was temporarily housed at Vancouver Buddhist Church before returning to the VJLS building in 1953.The existing building located on 475 Alexander Street in Vancouver is designated as a heritage building by the City of Vancouver as a symbol of Japanese-Canadian community and the internment. The building was named a National Historic Site on June 20, 2019, for its role as the oldest and largest Japanese language school in the country, but also because it is a rare documented case of property returned to Japanese-Canadians following the period of internment.

197,St. Roch (ship),"RCMPV St. Roch is a Royal Canadian Mounted Police schooner, the first ship to completely circumnavigate North America, and the second vessel to transit the Northwest Passage. She was the first ship to complete the Northwest Passage in the direction west to east (Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean), going the same route that Amundsen on the sailing vessel Gjøa went east to west, 38 years earlier.
The ship was most often captained by Henry Larsen.Liverpool-born Sgt. Fred S. Farrar RCMP (1901-1954) was a crew member of St. Roch for various voyages including the 1950 voyage that circumnavigated North America; he wrote the book Arctic Assignment: The Story of the St. Roch which was published posthumously in 1955.
The Stan Rogers song ""Take It From Day To Day"" is the lament of a crew member on St. Roch.
The ship is located at the Vancouver Maritime Museum in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and is open to the public for scheduled visits.


== Construction ==
St. Roch was made primarily of thick Douglas fir, with very hard Australian ""ironbark"" eucalyptus on the outside, and an interior hull reinforced with heavy beams to withstand ice pressure during her Arctic duties. St. Roch was designed by Tom Halliday and was based on Roald Amundsen's ship Maud.


== Service history ==
St. Roch was constructed in 1928 at the Burrard Dry Dock Shipyards in North Vancouver. Between 1929–1939 she supplied and patrolled Canada's Arctic.
In 1940–1942 she became first vessel to complete a voyage through the Northwest Passage in a west to east direction, and in 1944  became first vessel to make a return trip through the Northwest Passage, through the more northerly route considered the true Northwest Passage, and was also the first to navigate the passage in a single season. Between 1944–1948 she again patrolled Arctic waters. On May 29, 1950, she became first vessel to circumnavigate North America, from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Vancouver via the Panama Canal. In all she sailed three voyages.


== Exhibition ==
In 1954,  the St. Roch was decommissioned in Halifax and returned to Vancouver. In 1958, she was placed in dry dock at Kitsilano Point for restoration, partly inspiring the location of the planned Vancouver Maritime Museum, which opened the following year.  In 1962, St. Roch was designated a National Historic Site of Canada. Although the ship was placed indoors in an A-frame building adjoining the museum, it remained formally under the control of Parks Canada. In 1995 Parks Canada handed over full control of the St. Roch to the museum.

198,Vancouver Maritime Museum,"The Vancouver Maritime Museum is a maritime museum devoted to presenting the maritime history of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and the Canadian Arctic. Opened in 1959 as a Vancouver centennial project, it is located within Vanier Park just west of False Creek on the Vancouver waterfront. The museum is affiliated with CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.


== Collection ==
 
The main exhibit is the St. Roch, a historic arctic exploration vessel used by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The museum also has extensive galleries of model ships, including one with historic model ships built entirely from cardboard or paper as well as a particularly fine bone model of the French warship Vengeur du Peuple which was built around 1800 by French prisoners of war, a Children's Maritime Discovery Centre, a recreation of the forecastle of Vancouver's ship Discovery, an extensive collection of maritime art, and a large library and archives. 
Outdoor displays include the NASA undersea research vessel Ben Franklin and the boiler of the Beaver, the first steamship in the Pacific Northwest; it also has a small heritage harbour. There is a workshop where visitors can watch craftsmen build models. Of particular significance is the extensive Chung collection of material relating to Canadian Pacific steamships and original hand drawn charts from Captain Cook's exploration of the Pacific. This collection is separate from the Wally Chung material housed at the Rare Books and Archives Collection at the University of British Columbia.

199,Malkin Bowl,"The Marion Malkin Memorial Bowl, or Malkin Bowl, is a 2000-seat outdoor theatre in Stanley Park, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  Malkin Bowl is home to Theatre Under The Stars, which stages family-friendly Broadway musicals there.


== History ==
The Malkin Bowl was built in 1934 to replace a more traditional bandstand which had stood at the same location since 1911. The Bowl was designed as a two-thirds-size replica of the Hollywood Bowl. Allard de Ridder, then conductor of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, was largely responsible, along with John Vanderpant, for convincing W.H. Malkin, a former mayor of Vancouver, to build the theatre as a summer concert venue for the orchestra. Malkin endowed the theatre in memory of his wife, Marion.In spite of the lack of backstage space, in 1940 Theatre Under the Stars began staging operettas and musicals at the Malkin Bowl. In 1950, six productions were held during the summer season.A live variety show, hosted by Norman Campbell and broadcast on CBC Radio, was also performed at the Bowl during the 1940s.More recently the Malkin Bowl has hosted rock and pop concerts between theatre productions.

201,Ben Franklin (PX-15),"The Ben Franklin mesoscaphe, also known as the Grumman/Piccard PX-15, is a manned underwater submersible, built in 1968. It was the brainchild of explorer and inventor Jacques Piccard. The research vessel was designed to house a six-man crew for up to 30 days of oceanographic study in the depths of the Gulf Stream. NASA became involved, seeing this as an opportunity to study the effects of long-term, continuous close confinement, a useful simulation of long space flights.


== Design and operation ==
The Ben Franklin was built between 1966 and 1968 at the Giovanola fabrication plant in Monthey, Switzerland by Piccard and the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation headed by Donald B Terrana, then disassembled and shipped to Florida. The vessel is the first submarine to be built to American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) standards.   With a design crush depth of 4,000 feet (1,200 m), it was designed to drift along at neutral buoyancy at depths between 600 and 2,000 feet (180 and 610 metres). The 130-ton ship has four external electric propulsion pods, primarily used for altitude trimming. It is powered by tons of lead batteries stored outside the hull. Its length is 48 feet 9 inches (14.86 m), with a beam of 21 feet 6 inches (6.55 m) and a height of 20 feet (6.1 m). Piccard insisted on 29 observation portholes, despite the objections of engineers over the inclusion of potentially fatal weak points.

It began its voyage on July 14, 1969, off Palm Beach, Florida, with Piccard as the mission leader. Accompanied by surface support vessels, it resurfaced on August 14, 1,444 miles (2,324 km) away, 300 miles (480 km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The Ben Franklin made a few more dives after 1969, including the first deep-sea dive for Robert Ballard, the discoverer of the wreck of the Titanic.
After running aground on a reef in 1971, the Ben Franklin was sold to Vancouver businessman John Horton, only to languish for nearly three decades on the North Shore. In December 1999, with a sudden decision to either move or scrap the submersible, it was offered to the Vancouver Maritime Museum. After refurbishment, the submersible was placed in front of the museum.


== Crew ==
Jacques Piccard was the senior scientist on board, as well as the designer and engineer of the vessel.
Frank Busby and Kenneth Haigh were both Naval Oceanographic Office personnel.
Chester May was a NASA scientist in charge of observing the crew.
Don Kazimir was the Chief Pilot, and a former navy submarine officer.
Erwin Aebersold was an associate of Jacques' and co-pilot to Don.


== Influence ==
Ambient artists Mathieu Ruhlmann and Celer collaboratively released an album called Mesoscaphe in 2008 dedicated to the voyage of the Ben Franklin.

202,Brockton Point,"Brockton Point is a point and attached peninsula in Vancouver on the north side of Coal Harbour.  Named after Francis Brockton, it is the most easterly part of Stanley Park and is home to a 100-year-old lighthouse and several hand-carved totem poles made in British Columbia.
Part of the land at the point was first cleared in 1865 in order to construct a sawmill.  Due to rough currents around the point and a reef offshore, the Burnaby Shoal, however, the mill was built in Gastown and the point instead became the primary sports fields of early Vancouver. The main sporting venue, Brockton Oval, has been visited by cricket players such as Donald Bradman, Fred Trueman and Geoffrey Boycott. Cricket and rugby are still played here.


== History ==
Before 1865, the point was utilized as a graveyard for early settlers who came to Vancouver.  That year, Edward Stamp—a British businessman in the timber industry—cleared away part of the site in order to build a sawmill.  However, he was forced to abandon his plans after realizing the strong currents from the harbour impeded the construction of log booms.  He ended up moving the mill to Gastown, becoming Hastings Mill.The land cleared by Stamp was converted into sports fields by 1891. One of these, Brockton Oval, became a key amateur sports venue and was mostly used for cricket.  Donald Bradman and Fred Trueman both played at the Oval, and after Bradman's visit in 1932, he called the venue the most beautiful cricket ground in the world.  Geoffrey Boycott also played at the grounds in September 1964 and echoed Bradman's sentiments and praise of the Oval.


=== Totem poles ===

One of the province's most popular attractions is a group of ten totem poles at Brockton Point. Four totem poles were originally brought from Alert Bay and placed at Lumbermen's Arch in 1924.  Some had been carved back in the late 1880s.  More totem poles were purchased in the 1920s and 1930s, this time originating from the Haida Gwaii and Rivers Inlet. All of the totem poles were moved to Brockton Point in 1962 to allow the construction of an overhead road at Lumberman's Arch. Many of them have been replaced with replicas, with the originals now kept in museums for preservation. The most recent addition, erected in 2009, was carved by a member of the Squamish Nation whose mother was born in Stanley Park.


== Lighthouse ==
A number of ship collisions in the waters around the point led to the construction of a lighthouse and signaling station at Brockton Point. For a time, Brockton Point had a lighthouse keeper, who served for 25 years starting in 1855 and is credited for having saved 16 people from drowning. The present day lighthouse tower with an automatic light was built in 1914.  It was designed by British Landscape Architect Thomas Hayton Mawson, who also constructed the lifeboat house located below the point and other Stanley Park landmarks.

203,Brockton Oval,"Brockton Oval is a playing area near the Brockton Point located on the north side of Coal Harbour in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The ground was established 1891 with 10 sport's groups joining together. In 1927, cricket and rugby fields were carved out.Brockton Oval has been visited by cricket players such as Donald Bradman, Fred Trueman and Geoffrey Boycott. Around 2,000 to 3,000 people arrived to see the match at the ground when Australians and MCC sides visited the ground.The Oval is the home of Brockton Point Cricket Club which was one of the 7 founding member clubs of the British Columbia Mainland Cricket League in 1914. Vancouver Cricket Club began their journey on this ground in 1889.

204,Brockton Point Lighthouse,"Brockton Point Lighthouse is located in Stanley Park, Vancouver, British Columbia. The light was first established at the location in 1890. A square tower, painted white with a red horizontal stripe, was built in 1914. The lighthouse was designed by  William P. Anderson and has a red lantern and an arched base with a walkway underneath. The light has been officially inactive since 2008 but may still be displayed occasionally for decorative purposes.
The site is owned by the Canadian Coast Guard and has been managed by the Vancouver Parks Board since 2006.

205,Fountain Chapel,"The Fountain Chapel was a church located at 823 Jackson Avenue in Vancouver, British Columbia from 1918 until 1985. It was the local chapter of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) and was co-founded by Nora Hendrix (grandmother of guitarist Jimi Hendrix) to serve Vancouver's black community. Although not officially designated a heritage structure, the building is one of a few markers of the black community that once flourished in this part of Vancouver.
Prior to the establishment of the Fountain Chapel, black Christians held services in rented halls around town, and eventually a small group decided they should have a permanent church of their own. They set out to raise funds for the project and arranged for the AME to match the amount raised locally. Once financing was secured, they purchased the building on Jackson Avenue that was built in 1910 and had served as a Lutheran church for German and Scandinavian immigrants.The AME is a well-established Christian denomination that was founded in 1816 by African Americans in response to the racism they encountered in non-segregated churches. As such, the AME was an important institution for black opposition to antebellum slavery and anti-black racism generally.
The AME's activist tradition continued in Vancouver. The church was the locus for organizing against racism on more than one occasion.  In the 1922-1923 trial of Fred Deal, a railroad porter charged with murdering Vancouver police constable and Victoria Cross recipient Robert McBeath, the congregation of the Fountain Chapel mobilized to ensure that the likelihood Deal was racially targeted by police was accounted for in the verdict.  Consequently, the case was re-tried and Deal's original death sentence was reduced to life in prison. In another case in the 1950s, the Fountain Chapel was used to voice the black community's demands for an inquiry into the police beating of Clarence Clemons, a black longshoreman, who died shortly after the incident in question.The black community that had geographically coalesced around the Fountain Chapel in the city's East End was displaced during the city's slum clearance programs of the 1950s and 1960s. In 1985, not long after Nora Hendrix's death, the AME sold the building, which housed the Basel Hakka Lutheran Church from then until 2008, when the building was officially decommissioned as a church and became a private residence. The building is situated at the eastern edge of what was once Hogan's Alley. On January 30, 2014, Canada Post issued a stamp commemorating Hogan's Alley and the Official First Day Cover depicts an illustration of the Fountain Chapel.

206,Lost Lagoon,"Lost Lagoon is an artificial, captive 16.6-hectare (41 acre) body of water, west of Georgia Street, near the entrance to Stanley Park in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Surrounding the lake is a 1.75 km (1.09 mi) trail. The lake features a lit fountain that was erected by Robert Harold Williams to commemorate the city's golden jubilee. It is a nesting ground to many species of birds, including non-native mute swan (whose wing tendons have been clipped to prevent escaping), Canada geese, numerous species of ducks, such as mallard ducks, and great blue herons.  Also many turtles are usually resident on the northern shore.


== Naming and history ==
Native food gatherers used the low tide mudflats as a source for clams, and a midden on the north side indicates that a large dwelling once stood there.  In the Squamish language, the name is Ch'ekxwa'7lech, meaning ""gets dry at times"".  Settlers also built cabins around the lake, which were all removed between 1913 and 1916 during construction of the causeway. The lake was created in 1916 by the construction of the Stanley Park causeway; until then, Lost Lagoon was a shallow part of Coal Harbour, which itself is an extension of Burrard Inlet.
The name for Lost Lagoon comes from a poem written by Pauline Johnson, who later explained her inspiration:

""I have always resented that jarring unattractive name [Coal Harbour] for years. When I first plied paddle across the gunwale of a light canoe and idled about the margin, I named the sheltered little cove Lost Lagoon. This was just to please my own fancy for, as that perfect summer month drifted on, the ever restless tides left the harbor devoid of any water at my favorite conoeing hour and my pet idling place was lost for many days; hence my fancy to call it Lost Lagoon.The lake was officially named Lost Lagoon in 1922 by the park board, long after Johnson's death and, ironically, after the lagoon had been permanently lost after becoming landlocked.


== Development ==
When the causeway was first proposed in 1909, an intense public debate took place over the fate of the basin. As with most of the early controversies concerning the use of Stanley Park, organized labour was pitted against the more upper and middle class proponents of the City Beautiful movement. Trade union representatives argued that the majority working class population was in need of recreational facilities, while their opponents maintained that more aesthetic or ethereal considerations should take precedence in park development. The Vancouver Trades and Labour Council was adamantly opposed to the idea of an artificial lake, and argued for it to instead be filled in for use as a sports field. The park board retained the services of T. Mawson and Associates, an architectural landscaping firm that had designed the park's zoo and many other facilities in Stanley Park. The proposal the board settled on featured an artificial lake with a sports stadium on the northwest side and a large museum on the southwest shore. The $800,000 price tag, however, proved too steep for the board's budget, and the non-lake parts of the proposal were quashed.
The next phase in the lake's development came in 1929, when the saltwater pipes entering from Coal Harbour were shut off, turning it into a freshwater lake. The BC Fish and Game Protection Association was given permission to stock the lake with trout. The Stanley Park Flyfishing Association was formed, and charged members to fish in the lake, while the park board profited from the canoe and boat rentals. This came to an end in 1938 when the walkway around the lake was constructed and the area declared a bird sanctuary. Civic budgets were significantly reduced during the depression, but the park board benefited from the free labour of relief recipients, who were used to landscape Lost Lagoon.The next controversy surrounding the lake followed the proposal for a fountain to be erected in the lake to coincide with the city's Golden Jubilee anniversary celebrations in 1936. For the mayor, it would be ""a miracle of engineering,"" with the spray of water lit by virtually ""limitless combinations"" of colour. The public, in contrast, were not impressed by the proposal. Its $33,019.96 price tag was considered extremely frivolous in the midst of an economic crisis. As written in The Sunday Sun Edition of the Vancouver Sun Newspaper, Saturday, August 8. 1936. The lead story in the Magazine section is; SECRETS OF THE FOUNTAIN. It was the conception and idea of then, Chief Electrical Engineer, Robert Harold Williams with Hume and Rumble Ltd. electrical contractors. R.Harold Williams designed and supervised the erection of the Vancouver's Golden Jubilee fountain. After a business trip to Los Angeles he saw a fountain and thought this would be a great gift for the city for their up and coming birthday, Golden Jubilee celebration. To build the fountain, Lost Lagoon was drained. Seventy piles were driven into the mud. On these a concrete mat was laid. The fountain was built upon this mat. The work was of necessity rushed; it was done in a month. ""The fountain is worthy of all the traditions of art, worthy of Vancouver's Golden Jubilee, and it will be a permanent, decorative joy in Stanley Park"". ""When operating , it is like a symphony concert, in motion and color instead of music, says Harold Williams, engineer, of Hume & Rumble Ltd., under whose personal supervision the work has been done.""  Vancouver's Jubilee Committee and private citizens who contributed are to be commended on their work in pushing for this beautiful fountain, which is sure to be one of the major attractions during the Golden Jubilee celebration. ""We've had to hurry,"" says Mr. Williams,"" in that time 285 tons of cement have been utilized and all the special equipment was built.""  All equipment was built in Canada and the pumps were constructed in Vancouver. All union labor was employed. It was restored for Expo in 1986.Lost Lagoon is a popular place for park users for strolling the perimeter trail and bird watching. On the southeast corner of the lake is the Lost Lagoon Nature House, an old boathouse that is now an interpretive centre for the Stanley Park Ecology Society. While rare in recent decades, Lost Lagoon can freeze during a cold spell, permitting public ice skating and ice hockey.

207,Armoury Studios,"Armoury Studios is a Canadian recording studio located in Vancouver, British Columbia's Kitsilano neighbourhood.


== History ==
The Armoury building was constructed, from the ground up, in 1992 by Canadian songwriter/producer Jim Vallance. Vallance collaborated with architect Howard Airey on the building's design and engineer/producer and studio designer Ron Vermeulen (aka Ron Obvious) oversaw the technical and acoustical elements.
The studio was purchased from Vallance in 1995 by friend and producer Bruce Fairbairn, who produced music there with such artists as Chicago, The Cranberries, INXS, Kiss, The Harvest, and the Atomic Fireballs before he died in 1999 during the mixing of Yes' The Ladder.
Since 1999, the studio has been owned and privately operated by the Fairbairn family, serving a variety of local and international clients, including such artists as Elvis Costello, Nickelback, Seal, R.E.M., Bruno Mars, Hinder, Norah Jones, Nothingface, AC/DC, Tegan and Sara, Garbage, Stone Sour and Strapping Young Lad, among others.


== Facilities ==
The studio features an SSL G+ Series 4072 console with Total Recall and E Series ""black knob"" EQ as well as ten Neve 1081 Preamp/EQ's and eight Neve 1073 Preamp/EQ's. Also available to clients is a host of vintage outboard equipment and microphones from top manufacturers including Neumann and AKG among others.
The studio facility and equipment was maintained by Technical Director John Vrtacic until his death in 2009.
Other facilities include upper and lower lounges, stone fireplace, a kitchen and a patio with a barbecue and a view of the Burrard Inlet and North Shore mountains.

208,Vancouver Aquarium,"The Vancouver Aquarium (an initiative of Ocean Wise Conservation Association) is a public aquarium located in Stanley Park in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In addition to being a major tourist attraction for Vancouver, the aquarium is a centre for marine research, ocean literacy education, conservation and marine animal rehabilitation.
The Vancouver Aquarium was one of the first facilities to incorporate professional naturalists into the galleries to interpret animal behaviours.
Prior to this, at the London Zoo Fish House, naturalists James S. Bowerbank, Ray Lankester, David W. Mitchell and Philip H. Gosse (the creator of the word aquarium) had regularly held ""open house"" events, but the Vancouver Aquarium was the first to employ educational naturalists on a full-time basis. Aquarium research projects extend worldwide, and include marine mammal rescue and rehabilitation.
On August 9, 2010 Prime Minister Stephen Harper and B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell announced capital funding of up to $15 million. The province would donate $10 million in funding over the next three years to help pay for a planned expansion of the 54-year-old facility, Premier Gordon Campbell said.  Harper added that Ottawa would hand over up to $5 million to the aquarium for infrastructure upgrades. The aquarium, however, remains a nonprofit organization. The property is owned by the City of Vancouver and rented to the aquarium for $40,000 a year since 1991 (prior to which it was $1 per year).
In October 2009 the Vancouver Aquarium was designated as a Coastal America Learning Center by the US Environmental Protection Agency. As the first Learning Center in Canada, this designation is intended to strengthen the Canadian/U.S. partnership for protecting and restoring shared ocean resources.On August 31st, 2020, the non-profit announced on Facebook that due to the financial stresses caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it was pausing its public programming for the time being while it engages in strategic planning for the financial sustainability of its future operations.


== Aquarium history ==

The Vancouver Public Aquarium Association was formed in 1950 by UBC fisheries and oceanography professors Murray Newman, Carl Lietze and Wilbert Clemens. After receiving the help of timber baron H.R. MacMillan, alderman and businessman George Cunningham and $100,000 from each of the three levels of government. (City of Vancouver, Province of British Columbia, Federal Government of Canada), it opened on June 15, 1956 with the ribbon being cut by federal Minister of Fisheries James Sinclair. Sinclair's daughter 7-year-old Margaret was also present at the ribbon cutting ceremony (she would later marry Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and give birth to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau).
Officially Canada's first public aquarium, the Vancouver Aquarium has become the largest in Canada and one of the five largest in North America. The Vancouver Aquarium was the first aquarium in the world to capture and display an orca. Other whales and dolphins on display included belugas, narwhals and dolphins.
In 1975, the Vancouver Aquarium was the first aquarium accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). The aquarium is also accredited by the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA) and in 1987 was designated Canada's Pacific National Aquarium by the Canadian Federal Government.
On July 23, 1995, a beluga whale named Qila was born. She was the first beluga to be both conceived and born in a Canadian aquarium. A second calf, Tuvaq, was born on July 30, 2002, but died unexpectedly with no previous sign of illness on July 17, 2005.
In 1996, the Vancouver Park Board instituted a municipal bylaw that prevents the Vancouver Aquarium from capturing cetaceans from the wild for display purposes, and only obtain cetaceans from other facilities if they were born in captivity, captured before 1996 or were rescued and deemed un-releasable after this date.
On June 15, 2006 Canada Post issued a 51 cent domestic rate stamp to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the aquarium.
For many years, the primary attraction for visitors was the orca show. The aquarium was the first to capture and display a killer whale, Moby Doll, in a pen at Burrard Drydocks, for 3 months in 1964. Since then, it was home to Skana, Hyak II, Finna, Bjossa, and three of Bjossa's calves. When Finna died and Bjossa was left without other orca companions, the aquarium attempted to acquire one or more female orcas from other marine parks. However, no suitable companions were found, and Bjossa was moved to SeaWorld, San Diego, in April 2001 where she later died due to a chronic respiratory illness. The aquarium has since moved to emphasize the educational aspects of the displays rather than the public spectacle of the shows. They have also highlighted their research, rescue and rehabilitation efforts.
The aquarium has played a significant role in the research of wild orcas in BC. John Ford, a respected researcher who focuses on orca vocalizations, worked there for many years and they still fund a lot of the study. The Wild Killer Whale Adoption Program, which funds research, is also run out of the aquarium.

After considerable public discussion and some opposition from an animal rights group, the Vancouver Park Board voted in favour of a proposal to expand the aquarium at a cost of $100 million, funded by the aquarium, private donors, and infrastructure grants. A public consultation process, led by the aquarium and their own consultants, showed 89% of local residents were in favour of the expansion. The proposal will increase the size of the aquarium by 1.5 acres (6,100 m2) and extend its lease by 20 years. Construction was expected to begin in the fall of 2007.Vancouver Aquarium has not kept any orcas in captivity since 2001 and has pledged not to capture wild animals, but to instead rely on captive animals for breeding.


=== Temporary closure ===
On August 31st, 2020, the Aquarium made public via a Facebook update that it would be temporarily pausing public programming after September 7th. Despite the fact that the summer season was busy upon reopening, the social distancing requirements of being ""COVID-safe"" did not allow for the necessary visitor volume – ticket sales were down 80% and the not-for-profit was not able to cover costs. The organization stated that it would continue providing uninterrupted care to the resident animals while working on strategic planning; namely, how to operate in a way that would be financially sustainable in light of current conditions.


== Aquarium facility ==
The aquarium covers approximately 9,000 square metres (97,000 sq ft) and has a total 9,500,000 litres (2,100,000 imp gal; 2,500,000 US gal) of water in 166 aquatic displays. There are a number of different galleries, several of which were built at different times throughout the aquarium's history.


=== Pacific Canada Pavilion ===
This central indoor exhibit consists of a 260,000 litres (57,000 imp gal; 69,000 US gal) tank directly adjacent to the entrance. Fish and invertebrates from the Strait of Georgia are displayed in the exhibit.


=== Steller's Bay/Canada's Arctic ===
Originally this gallery included the beluga whales along with several non-living displays. In October 2009, a new exhibit opened here displaying several other arctic species, including fishes and invertebrates, along with expanded non-living exhibits as part of the Canada's Arctic Gallery. In 2016, the two rescued harbour porpoises from the BC Sugar Pool next door, moved to the Canada's Arctic Gallery. Following the deaths of two belugas in 2016, it has been converted into an active Steller sea lion research station called Steller's Bay in collaboration with the University of British Columbia. The exhibit reopened as Steller's Bay on July 1, 2017, while still retaining the Canada's Arctic portion in the underwater gallery. It is home to four female and two male Steller sea lions. In June 2018, a new ""Research Outpost"" Exhibit opened as an addition to Steller's Bay and programs about the aquarium's research and work regarding walruses, northern fur seals, and Steller sea lions occur.


=== Penguin Point ===
Inspired by Boulders Beach, this exhibit features African penguins bred by the Species Survival Plan.


=== The Wild Coast ===
This is an outdoor gallery that includes several pools, home to a Pacific white-sided dolphin and sea otters that are permanently on display here, along with a ""touchpool"" where visitors are able to touch British Columbian invertebrates. Several other species (harbour seals, Steller's sea lions, and a California sea lion) are rotated in to display in this area. When not housed in this gallery, they live in habitats that are either behind the scenes that are not accessible to visitors, Steller's Bay or the Research Outpost exhibits. There are plans to renovate the habitat into a new Canada's Arctic gallery that will house walruses and other arctic species. It is unclear what will happen to Helen, the Pacific white-sided dolphin, when construction starts in fall 2018.


=== Treasures of the BC Coast ===
This gallery is a series of separate exhibits that simulate the various aquatic environments on the BC coast. Octopuses, rockfish, sea stars, sea urchins, and anemones are among the animals here.


=== Tropic Zone ===
This gallery contains a large display of tropical fish and other animals, including blacktip reef sharks and a green sea turtle named Schoona.


=== Amazon Rainforest ===
A number of fresh water fish, snakes, caimans, sloths, birds, and other creatures from the Amazon inhabit this gallery.


=== Frogs Forever? Gallery ===
This gallery is an exhibit focused on the plight of the world's frog population which endeavors to show how people can help protect frogs and other amphibians.  It contains 26 species of amphibians from around the world.


=== Canaccord Exploration Gallery ===
This gallery is home to jellies, fish, and other animals.  The 4D Theatre and the children's play area known as ""Clownfish Cove"" are here, along with multiple classrooms for school groups, including the wet lab education room, which contains both conventional teaching methods such as computers, tables, and chairs, along with live animals and various artifacts.


== Animals at the aquarium ==

The Vancouver Aquarium currently houses around 300 species of fish, almost 30,000 invertebrates, and 56 species of amphibians and reptiles. They also have around 60 mammals and birds.
Currently, the aquarium houses one Pacific white-sided dolphin:

Helen is an approximately 30-year-old female dolphin at the aquarium. She came to the aquarium from the Enoshima Aquarium in Japan, and is also claimed to have been rescued from entanglement in a fishing net. Helen was part of a multi-year and multi-facility research project focusing on metabolic studies while she was at the Enoshima Aquarium, and is part of a pilot project to understand whale echolocation abilities to prevent whales in the future from becoming entangled in fishing nets. She is distinguishable by the fact that her pectoral flippers are partially amputated due to damage from her entanglement. Helen's tankmate Chester the false killer whale joined her at the Wild Coast on Thursday, June 24, 2015. As of November 24, 2017 Helen is the only cetacean left at Vancouver Aquarium after her tank mate Chester died earlier that same day.Past Pacific white-sided dolphins:

Laverne came to Vancouver from SeaWorld San Antonio. She died in 2009 due to a twisted intestine.
Spinnaker came to Vancouver in 2001 from Japan after getting caught in a fishing net. He died in 2012 due to a prolonged illness.
Hana came to Vancouver with Helen in 2005 from the Enoshima Aquarium in Japan after getting caught in a fixed fishing net. She died in 2015 from gastrointestinal torsion and sepsis following a last attempt to save her life with a ""breakthrough"" surgery.The aquarium used to house a false killer whale:

Chester was a young false killer whale that was rescued by the Vancouver Aquarium Marine Mammal Rescue Centre on Chesterman Beach on Vancouver Island in July 2014. In May 2015, Chester was deemed non-releasable by Fisheries and Oceans Canada which based their decision ""on the animal’s age at stranding, his lack of social contact and foraging skills in the wild, and his extensive contact with humans"". Chester was at the Wild Coast habitat along with Helen the Pacific white-wided dolphin. On November 24, 2017 Chester died of a bacterial infection. He was approximately 3 and a half years old.
Until 2016, the aquarium also housed two beluga whales. Qila was born in captivity, whereas Aurora was captured from the wild in waters near Churchill, Manitoba in 1990.
Aurora was a female beluga, who gave birth first to Qila, Tuvaq (who died in 2005) and Nala, who died on June 21 at around 10:15 pm due to coins and foreign matter found in her respiratory tract. ""Aurora"" is named after the famous northern light Aurora borealis. Aurora died on November 25, 2016 at around 30 years of age, and was the last remaining beluga at the aquarium.
Qila was a female beluga born at the aquarium to mother Aurora and father Nanuq on July 23, 1995 (21 years old). She is the first beluga to be conceived and born in a Canadian aquarium, and is also the first beluga conceived and born in a Canadian aquarium to give birth to a calf. ""Qila"" derives from the Inuktitut word qilalugaq qualuqtaq, which means ""beluga"". She gave birth to her first calf Tiqa, who died of heart failure and pneumonia on September 16, 2011. Qila died on November 16, 2016.Both belugas lived in the Canada's Arctic enclosure (Now Steller's Bay).
On breeding loan to SeaWorld, Shedd Aquarium & Georgia Aquarium are the following:

Allua, a female beluga is around 24 years of age. She was moved to SeaWorld San Diego on a breeding loan in 2005.
Imaq, a male beluga who is around 21 years of age. He is on breeding loan to SeaWorld San Antonio. Currently he is at the Georgia Aquarium.
Grayson, a  male beluga who is 8 years old living at the Shedd Aquarium. He was born at SeaWorld San Antonio in 2007, but belongs to the Vancouver Aquarium as he was born to Nanuq, who was owned by the aquarium and also fathered Qila. Until early 2016, Grayson was living at the Georgia Aquarium with his half-sister Qinu.
Qinu, a female beluga born in 2010 who is 7 years of age living at the Georgia Aquarium. She was also born at SeaWorld San Antonio and lived with Grayson until he was moved to the Shedd Aquarium. As with Grayson, she was born to Nanuq and belongs to the Vancouver Aquarium.Past belugas:

Kavna was estimated to be around 46 years of age at the time of her death on August 6, 2012. Cancerous lesions found on her reproductive tract may have contributed to her death. She was distinguishable from the other belugas by the fact that she was the whitest, due to her age.
Nanuq, was around 31 years of age at the time of his death in 2015. Nanuq was Qila's father and was on breeding loan to SeaWorld since July 1997 when he died of a jaw infection.
Tuaq was born to Kavna and an unknown wild beluga in 1977 but died 4 months later due to malnutrition and a bacterial infection.
Tuvaq was born to Aurora and Imaq in 2002 but died unexpectedly in 2005 from a heart arrhythmia.
Nala was also born to Aurora and Imaq in 2009 but died a year after due to foreign objects found inside her respiratory tract.
Tiqa was born in 2008 to Qila and Imaq and was the first 3rd generation beluga to be born at the aquarium. Tiqa's name stands for T-Tuesday, I-Imaq, Q-Qila and A-Aurora.  She died in 2011 due to pneumonia and heart failure.The Vancouver Aquarium used to house two Pacific harbour porpoise rescued by the aquarium's Marine Mammal Rescue Centre. Daisy was rescued from Gonzolez Beach, B.C. in 2008, and after receiving almost a year of veterinary care and being deemed nonreleasable, was transferred to the Vancouver Aquarium on July 29, 2009. Daisy died on June 16,
2017 
Another Pacific harbour porpoise, Jack, was rescued from Horseshoe Bay, B.C. in September 2011 and transferred to the aquarium on March 15, 2012. Jack died in August 2016.
The aquarium is home to Seven sea otters:

Katmai is a young female sea otter recently rescued near Homer, Alaska by the Alaska SeaLife Center on October 17, 2012, when she was only a few weeks old. Shortly thereafter, the Alaska SeaLife Center invited a rotating team of Vancouver Aquarium specialists to help provide intensive 24-hour care and rehabilitation for the pup over the next 17 weeks. After being deemed non-releasable by the U.S. Fisheries and Wildlife Service, she arrived at the Vancouver Aquarium on March 21, 2013. After an online naming contest, on April 2, 2013, the aquarium announced that the pup would be named Katmai after a national park in Alaska.
Rialto is a male pup that was found abandoned at Rialto Beach in Washington state's Olympic National Park by the Seattle Aquarium.  As U.S. Fisheries and Wildlife Services deemed him non-releasable and the Seattle Aquarium did not have space to accommodate another male sea otter, the decision was made to transfer him to the Vancouver Aquarium after he had recovered.  Rialto was permanently moved to Vancouver in September 2016.
Mak is a male sea otter pup who was transported to the aquarium from Alaska in November 2016 with Kunik.  Both were treated at the Alaska SeaLife Center and deemed non-releasable by the U.S. Fisheries and Wildlife Services.  Mak was found stranded in Kachemak Bay, Alaska by a member of the public.  His name derives from his rescue site.
Kunik is a female sea otter pup who was transferred to the aquarium with Mak in November 2016 after both were treated at Alaska SeaLife Center and deemed non-releasable by the U.S. Fisheries and Wildlife Services.  She found by the U.S. Coast Guard stranded on Homer Spit, Alaska, and her name is an Inuktitut word for a traditional Inuit greeting, or ""kiss.""
Hardy is a male sea otter pup who was rescued in June 2017 at Port Hardy, is the only Canadian sea otter at the aquarium.
Tazlina is a female sea otter pup who was rescued by some fishermen trawling for salmon at Alaska’s Anchor Point in April 2019. She was only a day old when she found by the fisherman, and she got sent to Alaska SeaLife Center by some volunteer. After taking care by the animal trainer from aquarium, she moved to the aquarium in September 2019.
Joey is a male sea otter rescued near Kyuquot, B.C. on July 2nd, 2020. He was about 10 days old and presumed the deceased, adult otter nearby was the mother.  Joey was rescued and transported to the Marine Mammal rescue Centre for treatment. Now, Joey remain at the Aquarium, with a 24 hour live stream of his recovery.  Currently, Joey has been deemed non-releasable and will remain with Vancouver Aquarium. Past otters:

Tanu is an adult female who was abandoned as a pup, rescued by the Alaska SeaLife Center and later moved to the aquarium.
Nyac was a female sea otter rescued from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.  She was one of the last surviving sea otters from the incident and was later featured in a viral YouTube video of sea otters ""holding hands"" recorded by Cynthia Holmes.  Nyac died on September 23, 2008 at approximately 20 years of age.  Days before her death, she was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which has been associated with contact with petroleum in other marine species.
Milo was a male sea otter rescued and brought to the aquarium after being deemed non-releasable.  Along with Nyac, he was featured in the viral YouTube video of sea otters ""holding hands"" by Cynthia Holmes.  Milo died on January 12, 2012 at the age of 12 years after being diagnosed with lymphoma.  He was the first otter to be treated with chemotherapy as part of a unique chemotherapeutic treatment plan developed by researchers, veterinarians, and pathologists around the world.
Walter/Wally was found as an injured adult sea otter in Tofino, on the West Coast of Vancouver Island. He had been shot by a shotgun and suffered extensive injuries as a result. After receiving critical care at the Marine Mammal Rescue Centre he became a healthy sea otter who would not survive in the ocean and was therefore moved to the aquarium. He was estimated to be over 10 years old at the time of his rescue.  He died on December 9, 2015.
Elfin is an adult male sea otter who was abandoned as a pup, was rescued by the Alaska SeaLife Center and later moved to the aquarium. Elfin died peacefully on April 1, 2017, at the age of 16. Elfin was distinctively known for his large amount of white fur.
The aquarium is also home to two harbor seals at this time, all of which are male (Jessica Seal, DaVinci, and Hermes). Jessica Seal was rescued from Kitsilano Beach in 2019 after being discovered to have been shot in the head by birdshot and blinded as a result.
The aquarium also houses 6 northern fur seals (Meechi, Tikva, Tuku, Kyoo, Aya, and Ani), and seven Steller sea lions (Amak, Kenai, Willo, Ashby, Rogue, Bella Bella, and Izzy). Some of the sea lions actually belong to the University of British Columbia, and are part of a research program aimed at studying the causes for the collapse of the Steller sea lion population in Alaska, while Bella Bella is housed at the aquarium after being rescued as a pup on McInnes Island in June 2017 and being deemed non-releasable. Amak and Kenai are half-siblings who were both born at Ocean Park Hong Kong in 2010 and lived at a Japanese facility before being transferred to the Vancouver Aquarium in May 2017.
The aquarium also currently houses an adult male California sea lion (Señor Cinco) who was found with gunshot wounds on Vancouver's Spanish Banks on May 5, 2017, and blinded as a result. He is their first California sea lion on display and currently lives in the BC Sugar Pool habitat.
At an off-site research facility, an additional 4 Steller sea lions are kept as part of an open-water research program. They are Hazy, Sitka, Boni, and Yasha.
On July 1, 2008, Tag, a 15-year-old male sea lion, died due to oral cancer, despite receiving laser surgery and chemotherapy. Tag was a 15-year-old male sea lion who arrived at the aquarium as a 2-week-old pup.The aquarium has one green sea turtle (Schoona). Schoona is a 16-year-old sea turtle, who has arrived at the aquarium in 2005.
Giselle is a zebra shark who arrived at the Vancouver Aquarium around 2008. Giselle is around 15 years old.

== Conservation and research programs ==
The Vancouver Aquarium has created and operates a number of conservation and research programs aimed at understanding and preserving animal species in the wild.


=== Ocean Wise Seafood ===
The Vancouver Aquarium has a program called Ocean Wise Seafood, which is aimed at promoting sustainable seafood in restaurants, markets, and other food service facilities. Its main thrust is to avoid species whose fishing typically causes large bycatches, species from areas where the habitat will degrade if overfished, and species which themselves are overfished. Ocean Wise works directly with food service companies to select sustainable seafood and actively promote them to the general public. The options are highlighted on participating restaurant menus and display cases with the Ocean Wise symbol, to help consumers make environmentally friendly seafood choices. Today, well over 700 restaurants and food stores in Canada are participants in the Ocean Wise sustainable seafood program.


=== Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup ===
The Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup is a program that was initiated by the Vancouver Aquarium by a small group of staff members and volunteers in 1994. These employees had heard about the International Coastal Cleanup and decided to participate in it by picking up garbage at a local beach and submitting the information. The Ocean Conservancy's International Coastal Cleanup is an annual international initiative aimed to engage people to remove trash and debris from the world's beaches and waterways, identify the sources of debris, and change the behaviors that cause marine debris in the first place.
Volunteers and sponsors collect and catalogue debris which is then collected for analysis on sources of garbage that enter the ocean. For example, in 2007, 1,240 beach sites with a collective length of 1,772 km were cleaned by 52,263 volunteers bringing in almost 87.5 metric tons of garbage.


=== Marine Mammal Rescue and Rehabilitation Program ===
The Vancouver Aquarium operates a Marine Mammal Rescue program which is aimed at rescuing and rehabilitating marine mammals that are found injured, ill, or abandoned, until they can be re-released into their natural habitats. On average, the Rescue Centre admits approximately 100 distressed marine mammals per year. The vast majority of these are harbour seals, but patients can include sea otters, elephant seals, Steller sea lions, harbour porpoises, and common dolphins. The program notably helped rescue Springer, an orphaned killer whale successfully released and reunited with her family pod. Other high-profile rescues include the successful returning of a beached grey whale back to the water in 2005 and the rescue of Schoona, a lost green sea turtle near Prince Rupert, BC. In October 2013, rescued harbour porpoise Levi became the first cetacean to be rehabilitated at the Marine Mammal Rescue Centre and released back into the wild.


=== B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network ===
The B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network is a collaborative conservation and research program between the Vancouver Aquarium and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada aimed at collecting reports and sightings of whales and sea turtles in the wild. The Sightings Network is a network of over 1,800 observers across British Columbia, including whale watching operators, lighthouse keepers, charter boat operators, tugboat captains, BC Ferries personnel, researchers, government employees, recreational boaters and coastal residents. The program aims to solicit reports through the program's website, a toll-free hotline, email, or through the logbook program.


== Controversy ==
In 2014, the Vancouver Aquarium's practice of keeping whales, dolphins and porpoises in captivity and its beluga whale breeding program sparked controversy.
In March 2014, two Park Board Commissioners, Sarah Blyth and Constance Barnes, publicly spoke out against the practice of keeping whales and dolphins in captivity at the aquarium. Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson, in an emailed letter to The Georgia Straight, expressed his personal belief that ""the Vancouver Aquarium should begin to phase out the holding of whales and dolphins in captivity"". Primatologist and ethologist Jane Goodall called for the Park Board to follow through with the proposed ""phase out"" of cetaceans and end the Vancouver Aquarium's captive breeding program.The Vancouver Aquarium responded to criticism with an open letter in which they explained that it was their policy not to capture cetaceans from the wild and that the aquarium played a role as a home for rescued cetaceans that cannot be returned to the wild.
The Park Board proceeded to commission an independent report from US wildlife veterinarian and scientist Dr. Joseph Gaydos in which he examined the aquarium's animal care standards, accreditation and research and compared it to similar facilities in North America. In his report he found that the Vancouver Aquarium ""either meets or exceeds North American industry standards"". He also concluded that the aquarium had ""an active research department that seems to make good use of studying captive cetaceans, not only for being able to provide better care and understanding of captive animals, but to a greater extent [...] to benefit our understanding and conservation of cetaceans in the wild."" Dr Gaydos also made two recommendations. He recommended that the Park Board conduct ""a large-scale scientific study on the welfare of captive housed cetaceans"" as a way of assessing ""the complex societal issue of captive cetaceans"". He also suggested that the Park Board require the aquarium to release an annual report on the state of its cetaceans.
In the media, the Gaydos report was widely received as a positive review of the aquarium's practices and the Vancouver Aquarium also received support from prominent philanthropists and politicians, as well as four former Vancouver mayors. The Monterey Bay Aquarium and the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California also spoke out in favour of the Vancouver Aquarium's cetacean program, citing its importance for scientific research.After a long public debate that ended with the presentation of the Gaydos report and two days of public hearings, the Vancouver Park Board announced in August 2014 that it intended to enact a by-law to ban breeding of cetaceans at the Vancouver Aquarium, and it tasked its staff with drafting an amendment to the existing by-law regulating cetaceans at the aquarium. Vancouver Aquarium CEO Dr. John Nightingale criticized the decision in a public letter, stating that the decision ""was not based on the facts or science presented"" and that it did not take into consideration ""testimony from dozens of the world’s scientific community, including experts in animal welfare and animal cognition."".Following a defeat in the elections to Park Board as part of the 2014 civic elections, a majority of the Park Board commissioners, in their last session, voted against enacting an amendment to the by-law.


=== Federal law banning captivity of cetaceans ===
In 2019, the Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act became law in Canada.  Two facilities would be affected, Marineland of Canada and the Vancouver Aquarium. When passed in June 2019, Marineland was reported to have 61 cetaceans, while the Vancouver Aquarium had just one dolphin remaining. The law has a grandfather clause, permitting those cetaceans already in captivity to remain where they are, but breeding and further acquisition of cetaceans is prohibited, subject to limited exceptions.


== In popular culture ==
The Vancouver Aquarium was featured frequently in the 1980s Canadian series, Danger Bay, which followed the day to day exploits of the Roberts family, led by Grant ""Doc"" Roberts, a marine veterinarian and his two children, Nicole and Jonah.
A YouTube video featuring two sea otters ""holding hands"" was recorded at the Vancouver Aquarium. The two sea otters are Nyac and Milo. Nyac died on September 23, 2008. She was one of the last surviving sea otters of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. The video has been viewed over 19 million times on YouTube. As a result, the Vancouver Aquarium created a live sea otter cam on their website. The YouTube video was originally recorded by Cynthia Holmes. Milo died on January 12, 2012.The Vancouver Aquarium was also featured in the family film Andre (1994), and romantic comedy Good Luck Chuck (2007), as Cam's workplace. Television movie The Suite Life Movie (2011) used the aquarium as the research firm where Cody Martin interns.
On September 5, 2008, Hayden Panettiere appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman and talked about her visit with the rescue dolphins at the Vancouver Aquarium.
The song ""Baby Beluga"" by Raffi was inspired by Kavna, a beluga that he saw while visiting the Vancouver Aquarium.

209,Seaforth Armoury,"The Seaforth Armoury is a Canadian Forces armoury located at 1650 Burrard Street in Vancouver, British Columbia. It is the home of The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada, a Primary Reserve Infantry unit.  The building was designed by the architectural firm of McCarter and Nairne, and is now listed as a Class A Heritage Building.


== History ==
From their creation in 1910 until 1935 The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada  paraded at the Beatty Street Drill Hall with the Duke of Connaught’s Own Rifles. The government was petitioned for a separate armoury to house the regiment and in the early 1930s a site was selected. The site selected was a plot of unused land at the south end of the recently completed Burrard Street Bridge.  The address was fixed at 1650 on what had been called Cedar Street but upon completion of the bridge Cedar Street became Burrard Street.
Work began in 1935 and construction was finished in 1936.  The Armoury was opened on 26 August 1936. The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada formed up in a hollow square and the Governor General, Lord Tweedsmuir, took the Royal Salute as the first parade was held on the Square.In June, 2012 the Armoury began a 3-year  $9.3 million seismic upgrade to upgrading the existing structure and renovation. A further $31.2 million was allocated to Carillion Pacific Construction for the construction of a new five-storey building which will be used for support organizations, as well as the headquarters for the 39 Canadian Brigade Group. 
The Jericho Armoury will being relocated to the Seaforth location, then divested.The Renovation was completed in May 2016. On Saturday September 24, 2016, the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada marched back to the Seaforth Armoury after an absence of four years. 
The new building becomes the new Vancouver Garrison and was officially named the Major General Bertram Hoffmeister Building  after one of Canada’s best Generals, who had served for many years as a Seaforth. 


== Occupants ==
In the Canadian Forces, an armoury is a place where a reserve unit trains, meets, and parades. 
As well as being the home of the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada, the Seaforth Armoury is home to The Seaforth Museum, an official Canadian Forces Museum.
In addition the armoury also garrisons 2 Cadet units:
72 (The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada) Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps
135 (Bell-Irving) Royal Canadian Air Cadet Squadron

211,"Fairview, Vancouver","Fairview is a neighbourhood on the west side of the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It runs from 16th Avenue in the south, to Burrard Street in the west, to Cambie Street in the east, and to False Creek in the north.
Central Broadway is an important commercial and employment centre focused around Vancouver General Hospital and other health-related institutions, including the BC Cancer Agency, BC Cancer Research Centre, BC Healthy Living Alliance, and the BC Centre for Disease Control. Other shopping areas in the neighbourhood are South Granville Rise, City Square Shopping Centre, and Granville Island.
Some city offices are located on the eastern fringe of Fairview, across Cambie Street from Vancouver City Hall.


== Education ==
Fairview is served by Kitsilano Secondary School and Eric Hamber Secondary School, as well as L'École Bilingue, Emily Carr Elementary School, Edith Cavell Elementary School, False Creek Elementary School, Henry Hudson Elementary School, Shaughnessy Elementary School, and Trafalgar Elementary School, although only False Creek and L'École Bilingue are physically located in the neighbourhood. The private schools Madrona School and Blessed Sacrament School also find their home in the neighbourhood.


== History ==
The Fairview area, like nearly all of what is now the city of Vancouver, was a primeval rain forest rich with wildlife and gigantic timber  until the opening of the Moodyville and Hastings Mills on Burrard Inlet in the 1860s and was one of the first areas to be logged.  The area was one of the CPR land grants within the city but remained largely undeveloped until the city's expansion outside the Burrard Peninsula with the construction of the city's new electric railway system in the 1890s.  Among the city's lines, which included the Cambie and Granville streetcars and the crosstown route along Broadway, a line known as the Fairview Loop ran in both directions from downtown up Main to Broadway to Granville and back into downtown.  With that area's ease of access to the city core, commercial and residential development quickly filled out the neighbourhood, which north of Broadway enjoys a fine view of the city core and the North Shore Mountains, hence the name. 


== Demographics ==
As of 2016, Fairview has 33,620 people. 9.6% of the population is under the age of 20; 40.0% is between 20 and 39; 32.8% is between 40 and 64; and 17.5% is 65 or older. 70.9% of Fairview residents speak English as a first language, and 7.7% speak a Chinese language. The median household income is $69,337 and 14.7% of its population lives in low-income households. The unemployment rate is 4.6%.

== History ==
The light in the Japanese Canadian War Memorial was switched off in 1941 after the attack of Pearl Harbor. In response to the perceived threat, Japanese residents were forced into internment camps. It was only in April 1949 that the all restrictions were lifted from Japanese Canadians. The memorial's light was eventually re-lit on August 2, 1985. 
In remembrance of those who fought for freedom & democracy in WWI and those who volunteered and died in WWII, even while their families (some of whom were themselves veterans of WWI) were interned in concentration camps. Lest we forget!

The property was designated a park by 1949, though no dedication was held.In July 1986, the Vancouver Park Board approved a fountain memorial to honor victims of the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima. The memorials, which was created by Sam Carter, features a water-filled bronze cauldron on a granite base and an eternal flame.In 1992, Seaforth Park was renamed Seaforth Peace Park during a ceremony in which local students created a peace grove consisting of twelve Cercidiphyllum (katsura) trees on the south side of the park.

214,Columbia College (British Columbia),"Nelson is a city located in the Selkirk Mountains on the West Arm of Kootenay Lake in the Southern Interior of British Columbia, Canada. Known as ""The Queen City"", and acknowledged for its impressive collection of restored heritage buildings from its glory days in a regional silver rush, Nelson is one of the three cities forming the commercial and population core of the West Kootenay region, the others being Castlegar and Trail. The city is the seat of the Regional District of Central Kootenay. It is represented in the provincial legislature by the riding of Nelson-Creston, and in the Parliament of Canada by the riding of Kootenay—Columbia.


== History ==


=== Founding ===
The western Kootenay region of British Columbia, where the city of Nelson is situated, is part of the traditional territories of the Sinixt (or Lakes) and Ktunaxa (Kutenai) peoples.
Gold and silver were found in the area in 1867. Following the discovery of silver at nearby Toad Mountain in 1886, the town boomed quickly, leading to incorporation in 1897. Two railways were built to pass through Nelson. Due to its location near transportation corridors, Nelson grew to supply the local mining activity and soon became a transportation and distribution centre for the region.
Nelson was named in 1888 after Hugh Nelson (1830-96), then Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia.


=== Early 20th century ===

Francis Rattenbury, an architect most noted in British Columbia for the Parliament Buildings in Victoria, the Vancouver Provincial Courthouse, and the second Hotel Vancouver, designed chateau-style civic buildings made of granite, which stand today. By the 1900s, Nelson boasted several fine hotels, a Hudson's Bay Company store and an electric streetcar system. The local forestry and mining industries were well established.
The town built its own hydroelectric generating system. English immigrants planted lakeside orchards, and Doukhobors from Russia, sponsored by Tolstoy and the Quakers, tilled the valley benchlands. The Doukhobor museum is located nearby, close to the neighbouring town of Castlegar.
During the Vietnam War, many American draft evaders settled in Nelson and the surrounding area. This influx of liberal, mostly educated young people had a significant impact on the area's cultural and political demographics.
Nelson's mountainous geography kept growth confined to the narrow valley bottom, except for certain hillside structures such as the local High School and the former Notre Dame University College (NDU) campus. Throughout the '60s and '70s, when more prosperous cities were tearing down and rebuilding their downtowns to the design of the time, Nelson merchants 'modernized' their buildings with covers of aluminum siding.


=== Baker Street ===
In the early 1980s, Nelson suffered a devastating economic downturn when the local Kootenay Forest Products sawmill was closed. Downtown merchants were already suffering from the opening of a large, regional shopping centre on Nelson's central waterfront, the Chahko Mika Mall. At the time, Victoria and Vancouver were experimenting with historical restorations of their oldest areas, with some success. To save downtown and Baker Street from blight, Nelson quickly followed suit, stripping aluminum facades and restoring the buildings to their original brilliance. Local designer Bob Inwood, one of Nelson's many American immigrants, played a major role as a consultant. By 1985, Baker Street was completely transformed. Affirmation of the street's success came in 1986 when Steve Martin chose to produce his feature film Roxanne largely in Nelson, using the local fire hall as a primary set and many historic locations for others. More broadly, the transformation marked the beginning of Nelson's ongoing transition from a resource-based town to an arts and tourism town. A walk down Baker Street through the Historic District is now one of Nelson's promoted visitor activities.


== Demographics ==


== Climate ==
Nelson has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb) with four distinct seasons. Winters are cold and snowy while summers are warm and drier with cool temperatures during the night. 


== Culture ==
Nelson has earned a reputation as a cultural centre. The downtown area is packed with good restaurants, cafes, coffee houses, local shops, small art galleries, the restored Capitol Theatre (a regional hub for the performing arts) and impromptu theatre venues. The city is about forty-five minutes away from the site of the annual Shambhala Music Festival, an internationally known artistic music festival held in August at the Salmo River Ranch. It is also home to the Whitewater Ski Resort and the Nelson Brewing Company (a regional microbrewery).
As with many communities in British Columbia, Nelson experienced a real-estate boom. In the early 2000s, real-estate prices skyrocketed, putting ownership out of reach for less affluent residents.Nelson has remained relatively free of the chain stores, franchises and strip-mall developments that are common in other towns of similar size, which lends to a distinct townscape.
For its geographic scale, the Central Kootenay region (in which Nelson is situated) has an uncommonly high number of organic farms, market gardens, and home gardens. Many Nelson residents grow decorative or food gardens (or both).
Nelson has several retail outlets for natural foods, including a year-round market specializing in these products.  According to journalist Bill Metcalfe, the Kootenay Country Co-op is “the largest independent member-owned natural food store in Canada and a respected player nationally in organic retail circles.”  The Save-On-Foods in Nelson is that company's leading store for organic and natural foods.Nelson has been noted for its illegal marijuana production, with The Guardian reporting in 2010 that:

Nelson was able to make the transition from a typical rural lumber town into a thriving arts and mountain sports hotbed, due in part to the wealth generated by marijuana growers. If one were to have spent the last three years in this idyllic mountain hamlet, the economic crisis would have been barely noticeable.

The Nelson Daily News was a local newspaper which began publishing in 1902. In 2010, it was announced the paper would shut down following a final edition to be published July 16, 2010. The closure occurred shortly after the Nelson Daily News' acquisition by Black Press, which purchased the paper from Glacier Media Inc.Black Press owns the Nelson Star, now published weekly.


== Transportation ==

Highways 3A and 6 pass through Nelson, while a scheduled commercial airline service is available at the West Kootenay Regional Airport, approximately 43 kilometres south-west of the city. Nelson Airport is several blocks away from downtown Nelson. Public transit in Nelson is provided by the West Kootenay Transit System, which runs several routes within the city and to neighbouring communities. 
Both Level 2 and Level 3 (DC fast charging) electric vehicle charging stations have been installed in the city. A carsharing service is available in the city through the Kootenay Carshare Co-operative.


== Activities ==
Set in the Selkirks, a number of artists and writers make Nelson their home. Nelson is highlighted as the ""Number One Small Town Arts Community in Canada"" by the publisher of The 100 Best Small Arts Towns in America, and is home to a large and diverse artisan community. The annual Artwalk, a display of artwork at various venues around town features local talent. July, August and September mark three months of exhibitions throughout the downtown core in variety of galleries and local businesses. Each month has a separate grand opening, (usually the first Friday evening of the month), which includes refreshments, musicians, pan-handlers and artwork for locals and visitors to enjoy as they stroll through downtown Nelson. 

The Cottonwood Community Market, located at Cottonwood Falls Park, takes place every Saturday from May through October. The Downtown Local Market happens on Baker Street every Wednesday from June through September. Marketfest, a lively nighttime street market in the heart of Nelson's downtown, happens on the last Friday of the month in June, July, and August. The markets all offer regional farm produce, delicious foods, and a variety of locally hand-crafted products.Two local hiking trails are popular. The Pulpit Rock Trail offers a short but somewhat challenging hike that ends with a view of the city. After Pulpit Rock the trail continues up the spine of Elephant Mountain (as the locals call it) to more postcard views, and eventually to the radio towers which are visible from everywhere in the city. Hikers venturing beyond Pulpit Rock should have basic wilderness gear and exercise common sense. Public access to the Pulpit Rock trail has been restored with the opening, in the spring of 2009, of a new access point several hundred metres west of the old trail head, which was on private land.In the winter, skiing and snowboarding are Nelson's primary outdoor activities. Thirty minutes south of town is the Whitewater Ski Resort, which provides access, (via one triple chairlift, one double chairlift, one quad chairlift, and a handle tow), to 396 vertical metres of beginner to advanced terrain. The resort also provides access to hundreds of kilometres of off-piste skiing and back country touring. In 2012 Nelson and Rossland, a small city south-west of Nelson, were jointly voted best ski locales in North America by readers of California-based Powder Magazine.
Mountain biking is part of the local culture, and Nelson offers a wide variety of MTB-oriented trails for all levels of experience.
Rock climbing is also a popular summer activity. Kootenay Crag, Hall Siding, Grohman Narrows and CIC Bluffs are popular city crags. Slocan Bluffs and Kinnaird are in nearby Slocan City and Castlegar. 2003 saw bouldering take off in Nelson, with extensive new development of bouldering areas in Grohman Narrows and nearby Robson.
Nelson is also located close to Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park.
On January 13, 2007, Nelson was the broadcast location for the annual Hockey Day in Canada.

215,Girl in a Wetsuit,"Girl in a Wetsuit is a life size 1972 bronze sculpture by Elek Imredy of a woman in a wetsuit, located on a rock in the water along the north side of Stanley Park, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.


== Description ==
The bronze sculpture depicts a friend of Imredy's, Debra Harrington, in a wetsuit with flippers on her feet and a mask on her forehead.


== Controversy ==
Although some believe it was a replica of Copenhagen's The Little Mermaid, the creator stated:

I didn't believe we should have a copy of the mermaid. She is rightfully a symbol of Copenhagen... I proposed to have a life-size scuba diver seated there. At that time scuba diving was getting quite popular here in Vancouver and, just as important, I didn't know of any similar sculpture anywhere in the world. It was a new idea… There was tremendous opposition and great controversy. I still don't know why.

219,Fraser Institute,"The Fraser Institute is a Canadian public policy think tank and registered charity. It has been described as politically conservative and libertarian. The institute is headquartered in Vancouver, with offices also located in Calgary, Toronto, and Montreal, and ties to a global network of 80 think-tanks through the Economic Freedom Network.According to the January 2020 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report (Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program, University of Pennsylvania), Fraser is number 14 (of 8,200) in the ""Top Think Tanks Worldwide"" and number 1 in the ""Top Think Tanks in Mexico and Canada"".


== History ==
The Fraser Institute was founded in 1974 by Michael Walker, an economist from the University of Western Ontario, and businessman T. Patrick Boyle, then a vice-president of MacMillan Bloedel. It obtained charitable status in Canada on October 22, 1974, and in the United States in 1978. Its stated mission is ""to measure, study, and communicate the impact of competitive markets and government intervention on the welfare of individuals."" The institute is named after the Fraser River.Sir Antony Fisher, previously instrumental in setting up the UK's Institute of Economic Affairs, was appointed acting director in 1975, until Walker became executive director in 1977. In its first full year of operation, 1975, the institute reported revenues of $421,389. In 1988, revenues exceed $1 million, and in 2003, $6 million.


== Political stance ==
The Fraser Institute describes itself as ""an independent international research and educational organization"", and envisions ""a free and prosperous world where individuals benefit from greater choice, competitive markets, and personal responsibility"".Forbes has referred to the think tank as libertarian. The New York Times has described the institute as libertarian and conservative. The Calgary Herald called it conservative, Langley Times classified it as right-of-center libertarian.


== Funding ==
As a registered charity with the Canada Revenue Agency, the institute files annual registered charity information returns. In 2010, the institute reported having $4.5 million CAD in assets and $10.8 million in annual revenue.The institute depends on contributions from individuals, corporations, and foundations.

It also received US$120,000 from ExxonMobil in the 2003 to 2004 fiscal period. In 2016, it received a $5 million donation from Peter Munk, a Canadian businessman.In 2012, the Vancouver Observer reported that the Fraser Institute had ""received over $4.3 million in the last decade from eight major American foundations including the most powerful players in oil and pharmaceuticals"". According to the article, ""The Fraser Institute received $1.7 million from 'sources outside Canada' in one year alone, according to the group's 2010 Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) return. Fraser Institute President Niels Veldhuis told The Vancouver Observer that the Fraser Institute does accept foreign funding, but he declined to comment on any specific donors or details about the donations.""


== Research and publications ==
The institute self-publishes a variety of reports:

Economic Freedom Index: The institute's annual Economic Freedom of the World index ranks the countries of the world according to their degrees of economic freedom. The institute has also published regional and sub-national reports ranking the economic freedom of North America, Latin America, the Arab World, and the Francophonie. These reports are distributed worldwide through the Economic Freedom Network, a global network of 80 think-tanks.
Human Freedom Index: Along with the Cato Institute and the Liberales Institut at the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom, the Fraser Institute publishes annual Human Freedom Index, which presents the state of human freedom in the world based on a broad measure of 76 distinct indicators that encompasses personal, civil, and economic freedom.  The index presents a broad measure of human freedom, understood as the absence of coercive constraint. The index covers the following areas: Rule of Law, Security and Safety, Movement, Religion, Association, Assembly, and Civil Society, Expression, Relationships, Size of Government, Legal System and Property Rights, Access to Sound Money, Freedom to Trade Internationally, and Regulation of Credit, Labor, and Business. The Human Freedom Index was created in 2015, covering 152 countries for years 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012. In January 2016 data for 2013 was added, covering 157 countries.
Waiting Your Turn: Wait Times for Health Care in Canada is the institute's annual report on hospital waiting times in Canada, based on a nationwide survey of physicians and health care practitioners. The twentieth annual survey, released December 2010, found that the total waiting time between referral from a general practitioner and delivery of elective treatment by a specialist, averaged across 12 specialties and 10 provinces surveyed, had risen from 16.1 weeks in 2009 to 18.2 weeks in 2010.

School Report Cards: Every year, the institute publishes a series of School Report Cards ranking the academic performance of schools in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, and Washington state based on the publicly available results of standardized testing mandated and administered by the provinces. The website www.compareschoolrankings.org allows anyone to compare up to five schools at once, based on a variety of performance indicators.
Tax Freedom Day: The institute's annual Tax Freedom Day report calculates the day the average Canadian family has paid off the total tax bill and royalties imposed on them and corporations by all levels of government. In 2016, Tax Freedom Day was June 7 with $45,167 (42.9 per cent of income) having been collected per family. The institute also offers a personal Tax Freedom Day calculator.
The institute publishes three magazines: Fraser Forum, a bi-monthly review of public policy in Canada; Perspectives, a French-language review of public policy in Quebec and la Francophonie; and Canadian Student Review, a look at current affairs written for students, by students.
In March 2010, the institute released Did Government Stimulus Fuel Economic Growth in Canada?

From 1979 to 1991, the institute's senior economist was Walter Block. Former Alberta Wildrose Party leader, now talk show host Danielle Smith.


== Controversies ==
According to an article published in CBC News Online, some people allege that Michael Walker helped set up the institute after he received financial backing from forestry giant MacMillan Bloedel, largely to counter British Columbia's NDP government, then led by premier Dave Barrett.
In late 1997, the institute set up a research program emulating the UK's Social Affairs Unit, called the Social Affairs Centre. Its founding director was Patrick Basham. The program's funding came from Rothmans International and Philip Morris. When Rothmans was bought by British American Tobacco (BAT) in 1999, its funding ended, and in 2000 the institute wrote to BAT asking for $50,000 per year, to be split between the Social Affairs Centre and the Centre for Risk and Regulation. The letter highlighted the institute's 1999 publication Passive Smoke: The EPA's Betrayal of Science and Policy, ""which highlighted the absence of any scientific evidence for linking cancer with second-hand smoke [and] received widespread media coverage both in Canada and the United States"". At this time the CEO of BAT's Canadian subsidiary, Imasco, was also on the Fraser Institute's board of trustees. The Fraser Institute ceased disclosing its sources of corporate funding in the 1980s.In 1999, the Fraser Institute was criticized by health professionals and scientists for sponsoring two conferences on the tobacco industry entitled Junk Science, Junk Policy? Managing Risk and Regulation and Should Government Butt Out? The Pros and Cons of Tobacco Regulation. Critics charged the institute was associating itself with the tobacco industry's many attempts to discredit authentic scientific work.In 2004, the Fraser Institute issued a statement of support for the legalization of cannabis and its sale on the market.

222,X̱wáýx̱way,"X̱wáýx̱way (Squamish Salish pronunciation: [χʷajχʷaj]) or x̌ʷay̓x̌ʷəy̓  (Halkomelem Salish pronunciation: [χʷajˀχʷəjˀ]), rendered in English as Xway xway and Whoiwhoi, is a First Nations village site, located in what is now Stanley Park in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  The village was located on the eastern peninsula of the park, near what is now Lumberman's Arch.  The village was home for many Squamish, Musqueam and Tsleil-waututh people, but after European colonization began in the Vancouver area, the inhabitants were forced to re-locate to nearby villages.  The village was named for a mask ceremony; thus, the best translation of x̱wáýx̱way would be ""masked dance performance"".


== History ==
X̱wáýx̱way is estimated to have been inhabited for more than 3000 years.  It was one of many villages on the shores of Burrard Inlet around present-day Vancouver.  The abundant resources in these lands were used by Squamish, Musqueam, and Tsleil-waututh peoples.  X̱wáýx̱way was one of the prominent villages in the area, hosting many houses; each was occupied by a large extended family.
By the late 1800s, X̱wáýx̱way was the largest settlement in what is now Stanley Park.  In the village, a big house or longhouse measured at 60 meters long and near 20 meters wide.  The structure was built with large cedar posts and slabs.  11 families lived in the house, numbering around 100 people.  A large potlatch, a ceremonial event conducted by wealthy families, was held at this house in 1875.  This event is also mentioned in the city council meeting minutes, where the medical health officer recommended the destruction of the buildings because of a smallpox outbreak, says Eric McLay, president of the Archeology Society of B.C.
With colonial British expansion from the east following the opening of the transcontinental railroad in 1886, Vancouver started to boom in population.  What is now Stanley Park was made a military reservation in 1859.  The native inhabitants of Vancouver, including those living in X̱wáýx̱way and nearby Senakw, were seen as an impediment to development, and were removed to reserves.   This process was facilitated by the passage of the Indian Act in 1876.  In the 1880s, surveyors and road builders demolished X̱wáýx̱way to create the Park Drive perimeter road.  In a 1934 conversation with archivist Major J.S. Matthews, August Jack Khatsahlano related to his childhood when he lived in the area. ""We was inside this house when the surveyors come along and they chop the corner of our house when we was eating inside...  We all get up and go outside see what was the matter. My sister Louise, she was only one talk a little English; she goes out ask Whiteman what's he doing that for. The man say, 'We're surveying the road. My sister ask him, ""'Whose road?""Local anthropologist Charles Hill-Tout noted several skeletons were found during an excavation near X̱wáýx̱way.  In the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh tradition, the deceased were placed in specially made bentwood boxes, and placed high in trees.  Some individuals or families of high social standing would be placed in cedar dugout canoes.
Squamish Nation chief Ian Cambell proposed in 2010 that Stanley Park be renamed Xwayxway Park after the name of this village.

223,Centerm,"Centerm is short for Centennial Terminals, a major dock in Vancouver's East Side. With the conversion to containerization and modular transport, the open pallet transport of goods that had prevailed on the waterfront was over. As such larger, newer facilities were needed by the late 1960s.  With the shipping rules changed in 1968, container cranes and flat wharf space became paramount.


== Construction ==
The old finger piers of the east end, piers such as Evans Coleman Evans; and Lapointe, which had been in Vancouver since its incorporation, gave way. Building rubble was dumped on the foreshore at Main Street and a peninsula where the Hastings Mill once sat and a massive terminal was created at the behest of Barney Johnson with Federal money in 1958, hence the Centennial Year and name  (BC's 100's birthday).


== Equipment ==
Container cranes, and heavy lift gear were installed. Room for two large freighters was created, both in terms of length and draught.  Over the years, the cranes have been expanded, the latter set was built in China, and quadruple stack containering allowed.


== Rail links ==

225,Stanley Park,"Stanley Park is a 405-hectare (1,001-acre) public park that borders the downtown of Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada, and is mostly surrounded by waters of Burrard Inlet and English Bay.
The park has a long history and was one of the first areas to be explored in the city. The land was originally used by Indigenous peoples for thousands of years before British Columbia was colonized by the British during the 1858 Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. For many years after colonization, the future park with its abundant resources would also be home to non-Indigenous settlers. The land was later turned into Vancouver's first park when the city incorporated in 1886. It was named after Lord Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby, a British politician who had recently been appointed Governor General. It was originally known as Coal Peninsula and was set aside for military fortifications to guard the entrance to Vancouver harbour. In 1886 Vancouver city council successfully sought a lease of the park which was granted for $1 per year. In September 1888 Lord Stanley opened the park in his name.Unlike other large urban parks, Stanley Park is not the creation of a landscape architect, but rather the evolution of a forest and urban space over many years. Most of the manmade structures present in the park were built between 1911 and 1937 under the influence of then superintendent W.S. Rawlings. Additional attractions, such as a polar bear exhibit, aquarium, and miniature train, were added in the post-war period.
Much of the park remains as densely forested as it was in the late 1800s, with about a half million trees, some of which stand as tall as 76 metres (249 ft) and are hundreds of years old. Thousands of trees were lost (and many replanted) after three major windstorms that took place in the past 100 years, the last in 2006.
Significant effort was put into constructing the near-century-old Vancouver Seawall, which can draw thousands of people to the park in the summer. The park also features forest trails, beaches, lakes, children's play areas, and the Vancouver Aquarium, among many other attractions.
On June 18, 2014, Stanley Park was named ""top park in the entire world"" by TripAdvisor, based on reviews submitted.


== History ==


=== Coast Salish Land ===

Archaeological evidence suggests a human presence in the park dating back more than 3,000 years. The area is the traditional territory of different coastal indigenous peoples. From the Burrard Inlet and Howe Sound regions, Squamish Nation had a large village in the park. From the lower Fraser River area, Musqueam Nation used its natural resources.Where Lumberman's Arch is now, there once was a large village called Whoi Whoi, or Xwayxway, roughly meaning place of masks. One longhouse, built from cedar poles and slabs, was measured at 61 metres (200 ft) long by 18 metres (60 ft) wide. These houses were occupied by large extended families living in different quadrants of the house. The larger houses were used for ceremonial potlatchs where a host would invite guests to witness and participate in ceremonies and the giving away of property.Another settlement was further west along the same shore. This place was called Chaythoos, meaning high bank. The site of Chaythoos is noted on a brass plaque placed on the lowlands east of Prospect Point commemorating the park's centennial.
Both sites were occupied in 1888, when some residents were forcefully removed to allow a road to be constructed around the park, and their midden was used for construction material.
The popular landmark Siwash Rock, located near present-day Third Beach, was once called Slahkayulsh meaning he is standing up. In the oral history, a fisherman was transformed into this rock by three powerful brothers as punishment for his immorality.In 2010, the chief of the Squamish Nation proposed renaming Stanley Park as Xwayxway Park after the large village once located in the area.


=== European exploration ===

The first European explorations of the peninsula occurred with Spanish Captain José María Narváez (1791) and British Captain George Vancouver (1792).
In A Voyage of Discovery, Vancouver describes the area as “an island ... with a smaller island  Deadman's Island (the correct name being Deadman Island) lying before it,” suggesting that it was originally surrounded by water, at least at high tide.
Captain Vancouver also wrote about meeting the people living there:Here we were met by about fifty [natives] in canoes, who conducted themselves with great decorum and civility, presenting us with several fish cooked and undressed of a sort resembling smelt. These good people, finding we were inclined to make some return for their hospitality, showed much understanding in preferring iron to copper.
According to historians, the natives probably first saw Captain Vancouver's ship from Chaythoos, a location in the future park that in today's terms lay just east of the Lions Gate Bridge (or First Narrows Bridge as it is sometimes called). Speaking about this event later in a conversation with archivist Major Matthews, Andy Paull, whose family lived in the area, confirms the account given by Captain Vancouver:As Vancouver came through the First Narrows, the [natives] in their canoes threw these feathers in great handfuls before him. They would of course rise in the air, drift along, and fall to the surface of the water, where they would rest for quite a time. It must have been a pretty scene, and duly impressed Captain Vancouver, for he speaks most highly of the reception he was accorded.
No significant contact with inhabitants in the area was recorded for decades, until around the time of the Crimean War (1853–56). British admirals arranged with Chief Joe Capilano that if there was an invasion, the British would defend the south shore of Burrard Inlet and the Squamish would defend the north. The British gave him and his men 60 muskets. Although the attack anticipated by the British never came, the guns were used by the Squamish to repel an attack by an indigenous raid from the Euclataws. Stanley Park was not attacked, but this was when it started to be thought of as a strategic military position.


=== Early uses of park land ===
The peninsula was a popular place for gathering traditional food and materials in the 1800s, but it started to see even more activity after the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in 1858, going through a succession of uses when Non-Indigenous settlers moved into the area.
The shallow waters around the First Narrows and Coal Harbour were popular fishing spots for clams, salmon, and other fish. August Jack Khatsahlano, a celebrated dual chief of the Squamish and Musqueam who once lived at Chaythoos, remembered how he used to fish-rake in Coal Harbour and catch many herrings. They would also hunt grouse, ducks, and deer on the peninsula.
Second Beach was a source of ""clay ... which, when rolled into loaves, as (my people) did it, and heated or roasted before a fire, turned into a white like chalk"" that was used to make wool blankets.Indigenous inhabitants also cut down large cedar trees in the area for a variety of traditional purposes, such as making dugout canoes.

By 1860, nonaboriginal settlers (Portuguese, Scots, and others) had started building homes on the peninsula, first at Brockton Point and later on Deadman's Island. ""Portuguese Joe"" Silvey was the first European to settle in the future park. A Chinese settlement also grew in a cleared area at Anderson Point (near the present day Vancouver Rowing Club).The peninsula was surveyed and made a military reserve in an 1863 survey completed by the Royal Engineers. Despite the houses and cabins on the land, it was again considered a strategic point in case Americans attempted an invasion and launched an attack on New Westminster (then the colonial capital) via Burrard Inlet.

In 1865, Edward Stamp decided that Brockton Point would be an ideal site for a lumber mill. He cleared close to 40 hectares (100 acres) with the permission of colonial officials, but the site proved too impractical and he moved his operation east, eventually becoming Hastings Mill. The land cleared by Stamp later became the Brockton sports fields.
The future park was selectively logged by six different companies between the 1860s and 1880s, but its military status saved the land from further development. Most of today's trails in Stanley Park got their start from the old skid roads.Near the end of the 1800s, the city's principal reservoir was built in the area south of Prospect Point that is now a playing field and picnic area. Despite the reservoir's demolition in 1948, there is still a Reservoir Trail at that location.
From the 1860s to 1880s, settlers in Burrard Inlet used Brockton Point, Anderson Point, and nearby Deadman's Island as burial grounds. This practice stopped when the Mountain View Cemetery opened in 1887. Deadman's Island had already had a long history as a burial site. In 1865, unsuspecting newcomer John Morton found old cedar boxes in the trees. They turned out to be coffins that had been placed there to keep the remains of important indigenous persons out of reach of wild animals.


=== Leasing the land ===

In 1886, as its first order of business, Vancouver's City Council voted to petition the dominion government to lease the military reserve for use as a park. To manage their new acquisition, city council appointed a six-person park committee, which in 1890 was replaced with an elected body, the Vancouver Park Board.
In 1908, 20 years after the first lease, the federal government renewed the lease for 99 more years.In 2006, a letter from Parks Canada stated that ""the Stanley Park lease is perpetually renewable and no action is required by the Park Board in relation to the renewal.""


=== Opening and dedication ===

On September 27, 1888, the park was officially opened (although the legal status of Deadman's Island as part of the park would remain ambiguous for many years). The park was named after Lord Stanley, who had recently become Canada's sixth governor general (and who is perhaps best known today for having donated the Stanley Cup that was later handed down to the National Hockey League). Mayor David Oppenheimer gave a formal speech opening the park to the public and delivering authority for its management to the park committee.The following year, Lord Stanley became the first governor general to visit British Columbia when he officially dedicated the park. Mayor Oppenheimer led a procession of vehicles around Brockton Point along the newly completed Park Road to the clearing at Prospect Point. An observer at the event wrote:

Lord Stanley threw his arms to the heavens, as though embracing within them the whole of 1000 acres of primeval forest, and dedicated it ""to the use and enjoyment of peoples of all colours, creeds, and customs, for all time. I name thee Stanley Park.""


=== Eviction of pre-park residents ===

When Lord Stanley made his declaration, there were still a number of homes on lands he had claimed for the park. Some, who had built their homes less than twenty years earlier, would continue to live on the land for years. Most were evicted by the park board in 1931, but the last resident, Tim Cummings, lived at Brockton Point until his death in 1958.Sarah Avison, the daughter of the first park ranger, recalled when the city evicted the Chinese settlers at Anderson Point in 1889:

The Park Board ordered the [Chinese settlers] to leave the park; they were trespassers; but [they] would not go, so the Park Board told my father to set fire to the buildings. I saw them burn; there were five of us children, and you know what children are like when there is a fire. So father set fire to the shacks; what happened to the Chinese I do not know.
Most of the dwellings at Xwayxway were reported vacant by 1899, and in 1900, two of such houses were purchased by the Park Board for $25 each and burned. One Squamish family, “Howe Sound Jack” and Sexwalia “Aunt Sally” Kulkalem, continued to live at Xwayxway until Sally died in 1923. Sally's ownership of the property surrounding her home was accepted by authorities in the 1920s, and following her death, the property was purchased from her heir, Mariah Kulkalem, for $15,500 and resold to the federal government.


=== Construction of Lost Lagoon and causeway ===

From 1913 to 1916, a lake was constructed in a shallow part of Coal Harbour, a project that was not without its detractors. The lake was named Lost Lagoon due to its history of ‘disappearing’ at low tide. The lake and a causeway into the park were designed by Thomas Mawson, who also designed a lighthouse for Brockton Point around the same time. Before the Causeway, a wooden footbridge provided the only access route into the park from Coal Harbour. Construction of the causeway (and new roads within the park for emergency access) was completed by 1926.In 1923, the saltwater pipes entering the lake from Coal Harbour were shut off, turning it into a freshwater lake. A lit fountain was later erected to commemorate the city's golden jubilee. The fountain, installed in 1936, was purchased from Chicago, a leftover from its world's fair in 1934.The causeway was widened and extended through the center of the park in the 1930s with the construction of the Lions Gate Bridge, which connects downtown to the North Shore. At the same time, two pedestrian subways were added under the Causeway at the entrance to the park from Georgia Street.
By the 1950s, visitors could take rented rowboats on Lost Lagoon, but boating and other activities were banned in 1973 as the lake became a bird sanctuary. By 1995, the old boathouse had been turned into the Lost Lagoon Nature House. It is operated by the Stanley Park Ecology Society, which is a non-profit organization that works alongside of the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation to promote stewardship and conservation in Stanley Park.


=== Seawall ===

Construction of the 8.8-kilometre (5.5 mi) seawall and walkway around the park began in 1917 and took several decades to complete. The original idea for the seawall is attributed to park board superintendent, W. S. Rawlings, who conveyed his vision in 1918: It is not difficult to imagine what the realization of such an undertaking would mean to the attractions of the park and personally I doubt if there exists anywhere on this continent such possibilities of a combined park and marine walk as we have in Stanley Park. James ""Jimmy"" Cunningham, a master mason, dedicated 32 years of his life to the construction of the seawall from 1931 until his retirement in 1963. Cunningham continued to return to monitor the wall's progress until his death at 85.The walkway has been extended several times and is currently 22 kilometres (14 mi) from end to end, making it the world's longest uninterrupted waterfront walkway. The Stanley Park portion is just under half of the entire length, which starts at Canada Place in the downtown core, runs around Stanley Park, along English Bay, around False Creek, and finally to Kitsilano Beach. From there, a trail continues 600 metres to the west, connecting to an additional 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) of beaches and pathways which terminate at the mouth of the Fraser River.


=== Swimming pools ===

By 1932, there were two seaside, saltwater pools in the park, one at Second Beach and one at Lumberman's Arch. These ""draw and fill"" pools used sun-warmed water from the ocean. Once a week the pool gates were opened at low tide to release the water back into the ocean, before the next high tide of clean water.
For many years, children could take swimming lessons for free at Lumberman's Arch under the Vancouver Sun's Learn to Swim program. The pool was filled in after developing persistent problems and replaced with the current water spray park in 1987. The spray park, the largest of its kind in Vancouver, consists of a series of water geysers, showers, and cannons.
In 1995, after more than 60 years of operation, the Second Beach pool was shut down because it failed to meet new health standards. By 1996, it had been replaced with the current heated pool.
At both locations, remnants of the old pool's semicircle shaped outer wall can still be seen.


=== In wartime ===

See List of World War II-era fortifications on the British Columbia CoastIn World War I, a gun battery (without a bunker) was placed at Siwash Point (above Siwash Rock) to protect the city from possible attacks from German merchant raiders. It was removed just prior to the end of the war in 1918.In 1936, when the Empire of Japan began large-scale military repression in northeast China, the perceived Japanese threat resulted in fortifications being erected in Stanley Park, among other areas. In Stanley Park, a watch tower was built on the cliff directly above Siwash Rock and remains intact as an observation deck that is accessed from the trails above.
By 1940, a gun battery and bunker had been built at Ferguson Point, just east of Third Beach. The military also expanded its use of the park by closing the area around Ferguson Point and Third Beach, where it had established barracks for the battery detachment and was providing training. What is now the Teahouse restaurant was originally built as an officers' mess. The bunker was buried and battery removed around the end of the war.
The army built several other coastal defence forts for the second World War, as shown in the illustration at right, most notably at Tower Beach in Point Grey. In addition, an examination area was set up where any ships requesting entrance to the harbour had to stop and submit to an inspection.


=== Zoo and Children's Farmyard ===

From the very beginning, the park kept and exhibited animals after the first park ranger, Henry Avison, captured an orphaned black bear cub and chained it to a stump for safety in 1888. By 1905 several animals had been donated: a monkey, a large seal, four grass parakeets, a raccoon, a canary, and a black bear. Avison was subsequently named city pound keeper, and his collection of animals formed the basis for the original zoo, which eventually housed over 50 animals, including snakes, wolves, emus, bison, kangaroos, monkeys, and Humboldt penguins.By the 1970s, the zoo with its new polar bear exhibit, built in 1962, had become the park's main attraction. Today the only remnant of the old zoo is a large concrete grotto where the polar bears had entertained crowds for many years until the 1990s. In 1994, when plans were developed to upgrade the zoo, Vancouver voters instead decided to phase it out when the question was posed in a referendum. The zoo was shut down in 1996 and the animals were either moved to the petting zoo area, the Greater Vancouver Zoo in Aldergrove, or to other facilities.
The Stanley Park Zoo closed completely in December 1997 after the last remaining animal, a polar bear named Tuk, died at age 36. He had remained after the other animals had left because of his old age. The polar bear grotto, often criticised by animal rights activists, was to be converted into a demonstration salmon spawning hatchery.The Stanley Park Children's Farmyard (petting zoo) opened in 1982. It was a successor to the original children's zoo that started in 1950. Domestic animals and a few reptiles and birds were kept in the Children's Farmyard until it closed in 2011.


=== Aquarium ===

The aquarium opened in 1956 due to complicated negotiations, followed by a massive expansion in 1967. It was the first facility in the world to study a killer whale (1964); its researchers discovered a new species of shrimp in the Gulf Islands (1997); and it became the first aquarium to ensure that it would never result in the capture of a wild whale or dolphin (1996). The popular children's song ""Baby Beluga"" was inspired by one of the whales at the facility.
In 2006, the park board approved an $80 million expansion of the facility, following considerable public debate and despite a vocal opposition concerned about animal rights and the loss of park trees required by the expansion.


=== 1960s counterculture ===
By the 1960s, the neighbourhood around Stanley Park was similar to present day Commercial Drive, attracting many of the city's beatniks and flower children. This made Stanley Park the perfect place for be-ins, a type of counterculture event inspired by the Human Be-In started in San Francisco. The Stanley Park event started on Easter weekend in 1967 and took place each spring until the mid-1970s, when most of the counterculture movement had fizzled out. At its peak, thousands would assemble at Ceperley Meadows near Second Beach to listen to bands, speakers, and poets, and socialize.


=== Storms and loss of landmark trees ===
 
Violent windstorms have struck Stanley Park and felled many of its trees numerous times in the past. Between 1900 and 1960, nineteen separate windstorms swept through the park, causing significant damage to the forest cover. The park lost some of its oldest trees through major storms twice in the last century and then again in 2006. The first was a combination of an October windstorm in 1934 and a subsequent snowstorm the following January that felled thousands of trees, primarily between Beaver Lake and Prospect Point.Another storm in October 1962, the remnants of Typhoon Freda, cleared a 2.4-hectare (6-acre) virgin tract behind the children's zoo, which opened an area for a new miniature railway that replaced a smaller version built in the 1940s. In total, approximately 3,000 trees were lost in that storm.One stand of tall trees in the centre of the park did not survive beyond the 1960s after becoming a popular tourist attraction. The “Seven Sisters” are memorialized by a plaque and young replacement trees in the same location along Lovers Walk, a forest trail that connects Beaver Lake with Second Beach. “They were so popular that people basically killed them by walking on their roots,” says historian John Atkin.The death of the distinctive fir tree atop Siwash Rock has also been memorialized with a replacement. The original died in the dry summer of 1965, and through the persistent efforts of park staff, a replacement finally took root in 1968.
Another major windstorm ravaged the park on December 15, 2006, with 115 kilometres per hour (71 mph) winds (Hanukkah Eve windstorm). Over 60% of the western edge was damaged; the worst part was the area around Prospect Point. In total, about 40% of the forest was affected, with an estimated 10,000 trees downed. Large sections of the seawall were also destabilized by the storm, and many areas of the park were closed to the public pending restoration. The cost of restoration has been estimated at $9 million, which was covered by contributions from all three levels of government and private and corporate donations.Two landmark trees were affected. One tree that has achieved a lot of fame is the National Geographic Tree, so named because it appeared in the magazine's October 1978 issue. With a circumference of 13.5 m (44 1⁄2 ft), it was once one of the more impressive big western red cedars of the park. It diminished over time, ravaged by storms, a lightning strike, and topped by park staff to a height of 39.6 metres (130 ft) before being uprooted in October 2007.The Hollow Tree was probably the most photographed park element in bygone years, an obligatory stop for locals, tourists and dignitaries alike, and a professional photographer was on hand to capture the visit for a fee. The tree was saved from road widening in 1910 through the lobbying efforts of the photographer who made his living at the tree. Automobiles and horse-drawn carriages would frequently be backed into the hollow, demonstrating the immensity of the tree for posterity. While the remaining 700- to 800-year-old stump still draws viewers and is commemorated with a plaque, it is no longer alive and has shrunk considerably over the years, from a circumference of 18.3 metres (60 ft) many decades ago, to a more recent 17.1 metres (56 ft). Damaged by the December 2006 windstorm and leaning forward at a dangerous angle, on March 31, 2008, the tree was targeted by the Vancouver Park Board for removal due to potential safety hazards. However, on January 19, 2009, the Board accepted a proposal to save the tree by realigning and stabilizing it at a cost of $250,000, funded entirely by private donations.


== Today ==
The forest continues to give the park a more natural character than most other urban parks, leading many to call it an urban oasis. It consists of primarily second and third growth and contains many tall Douglas fir, western red cedar, western hemlock, and Sitka spruce trees. Since 1992, the tallest trees have been topped and pruned by park staff for safety reasons.
A large variety of animals live in the park. There are 200 bird species alone, including many water birds. A large great blue heron colony moved into the park in 2001 and has grown to now about 170 active nests. Mammals include a large raccoon population, coyotes, skunks, beavers, rabbits descended from discarded pets, and a thriving grey squirrel population (descended from eight pairs acquired from New York's Central Park in 1909). However, there is a complete absence of large mammals including deer, elk, bear, wolves, cougars, and bobcats.Stanley Park also has many manmade attractions. Recreational facilities are especially abundant in the park, having long coexisted, albeit uneasily, with the aesthetic and more natural park features preferred by those looking to the park as an enclave of nature in the city.While it is not the largest of its kind, Stanley Park is about one-fifth larger than New York City's 340-hectare (840-acre) Central Park and almost half the size of London's 960-hectare (2,360-acre) Richmond Park.


=== Recognition ===
The park was designated a National Historic Site of Canada by the federal government in 1988. It was deemed significant because the relationship between its ""natural environmental and its cultural elements developed over time"" and because ""it epitomizes the large urban park in Canada.""Stanley Park was named the best park in the world in 2013, according to website TripAdvisor's first ever Travellers' Choice Awards. Central Park in New York took second place and Colorado's Garden of the Gods was third place.


=== Attractions ===

The Vancouver Seawall is popular for walking, running, cycling, inline skating, and even fishing (with a licence). There are two paths, one for skaters and cyclists and the other for pedestrians. The lane for cyclists and skaters goes one-way in a counterclockwise loop. Walking the entire loop around Stanley Park takes about two hours, while biking it takes about one hour.
There are also more than 27 kilometres (17 mi) of forest trails inside the park. Forest trails are patrolled by members of the Vancouver Police Department on horseback. The Mounted Unit's youth outreach includes offering guided tours of the stables and the ‘Collector’s Trading Card Program,’ which encourages children of all ages to approach a constable on horseback and request a card.

The 20 in (508 mm) narrow-gauge Stanley Park Railway, a rideable miniature railway with different seasonal themes, is a Vancouver tradition, especially for families with young children. The original railway, started in 1947, featured a child-sized train. The current adult-sized railroad opened in 1964 in an area leveled by Typhoon Freda. The engine is a replica of the first transcontinental passenger train to arrive in Vancouver in the 1880s.The windstorm of 2006 revealed traces of a long-forgotten rock garden, which had once been one of the park's star attractions and one of its largest man-made objects by area. Soon after its discovery, a section that encircles part of the Stanley Park Pavilion was restored (the garden had originally extended from Pipeline Road to Coal Harbour).

Beaver Lake is a restful space nestled among the trees. The lake is almost completely covered with water lilies (introduced for the Queen's Jubilee in 1938) and home to beavers, fish, and water birds. As of 1997, its surface area was just short of 4 hectares (10 acres), but the lake is slowly shrinking in size. One of Vancouver's few remaining free-flowing streams, Beaver Creek, joins Beaver Lake to the Pacific Ocean and is one of two streams in Vancouver where salmon still return to spawn each year.

Lost Lagoon, the captive 17-hectare (41-acre) freshwater lake near the Georgia Street entrance to the park, is a nesting ground to many bird species, such as Canada geese, and ducks.
The Vancouver Aquarium is the largest in Canada and houses a collection of marine life that includes dolphins, belugas, sea lions, harbour seals, and sea otters. In total, there are approximately 300 species of fish, 30,000 invertebrates, 56 species of amphibians and reptiles, and around 60 mammals and birds. The aquarium is also home to a 4D theatre.
The oldest manmade landmark in the park is an 1816 naval cannon located near Brockton Point. The Nine O’Clock Gun, as it is known today, was fired for the first time in 1898, a tradition that has continued for more than 100 years. The cannon was originally detonated with a stick of dynamite, but is now activated automatically with an electronic trigger.
Stanley Park also has playgrounds, sandy beaches, gardens, tennis courts, an 18-hole pitch and putt golf course, a seaside swimming pool, a water spray park, and Brockton Oval, which is used for track sports, rugby, and cricket.
In summer, there is an outdoor theatre Malkin Bowl, which features events by Theatre Under the Stars and Live Nation (with their Concerts in the Park series).


=== Monuments ===

The park has a large number of monuments, including statues, plaques, and gardens. Among these are the Japanese Canadian War Memorial (a cenotaph and two rows of Japanese cherry Prunus Shirotae trees) and statues of poet Robert Burns, Olympic runner Harry Jerome, and Girl in a Wetsuit.
The park board has banned the erection of any further memorials to ensure that Stanley Park is kept in a more natural state (and based on the view that it is already saturated). As an exception to the ban, the park board agreed in 2006 to build a new playground at Ceperley Meadows near Second Beach honouring the victims of the Air India Flight 182 bombing. The federal government spent approximately $800,000 to build the memorial and playground.


=== Great blue herons ===
Stanley Park is home to one of the largest urban great blue heron colonies in North America, and the birds have been documented nesting in various locations in Stanley Park as far back as 1921. Great blue herons are classified as a species at risk in BC, and the Stanley Park Ecology Society has been monitoring the heronry in Stanley Park since 2004. An estimated 156 young Pacific great blue herons fledged from the colony in 2013. Since monitoring started in 2007, the highest number of great blue herons fledged in a year were 258, in 2007. The lowest number of fledges was in 2011 with just 99 of the birds fledged.

226,Douglas Reynolds Gallery,"Douglas Reynolds Gallery is an art gallery in Vancouver, British Columbia. It is located in the Business Improvement Area of South Granville. The gallery was founded in 1995 by Douglas Reynolds.


== History ==
Douglas Reynolds grew up in the Lower Mainland and after working with other galleries in Vancouver opened Douglas Reynolds Gallery. The gallery specializes in contemporary Northwest Coast art, working closely with Northwest Coast Indigenous artists. The gallery represents over 100 artists from indigenous cultural groups spanning from the Haida and Tlingit in northern British Columbia to the Coast Salish in the Vancouver area and northern Washington state. Trevor Angus, Hollie Bartlett, Robert Davidson, Beau Dick, Jim Hart, Francis Horne, Susan Point, Bill Reid, and Don Yeomans are some artists represented. It is one of the premier Northwest Coast art galleries in Canada.


== Artwork ==


=== Wood ===
The gallery's collections include totem poles and carved paddles and masks, among the most recognizable forms of Indigenous art from the Northwest Coast. Nearly all totem poles are carved from a single trunk of a Western red cedar.  The cedar tree is the most common wood used and is known as the tree of life on the Northwest Coast due to its versatility and abundance. Other wood types include yellow cedar, maple and alder.


=== Gold and Silver Jewelry ===
The gallery carries a wide range of jewelry products that continue a tradition of personal adornment dating back to the 1840s, including gold and silver rings, bracelets and pendants. The majority of pieces are modern works, however the gallery also carries historic jewelry pieces and works by past artists, notably Haida artist Bill Reid.


== Media and Commissions ==
TELUS has furnished their Vancouver headquarters with the help of the gallery.The gallery was featured in Maker of Monsters, a 2017 documentary on the life and work of Kwakwaka'wakw artist Beau Dick. Douglas Reynolds was interviewed in the documentary talking his professional and personal relationship with Beau Dick, lasting over 30 years.In 2020 Haisla artist Hollie Bartlett gifted an 18kt Gold Whale Tail pendant from Douglas Reynolds Gallery to Vancouver non-profit Justice for Girls, who donated it to Meghan Markle.In February 2020 visiting AINU artist from Japan, Hiroyuki Shimokura, visited the gallery and met with Tsimshian artist Phil Gray.

227,Vancouver General Hospital,"Vancouver General Hospital (locally known as VGH, or Vancouver General) is a medical facility located in Vancouver, British Columbia. It is the largest facility in the Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre (VHHSC) group of medical facilities. VGH is Canada's second largest hospital, after The Ottawa Hospital.
Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) is responsible for all operations at Vancouver General Hospital.


== History ==
The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) first opened in 1886 a nine-bed tent, its primary use to treat railway workers. On June 13, 1886, a fire destroyed the tent hospital and by July, a new, one-storey building was built. In September, the City of Vancouver took over the facility, which became the City Hospital. In 1888, located at the southern edge of the original Gastown settlement, a 35-bed hospital opened, as the tent infirmary became too small. The upstairs ward was for female patients, the downstairs ward for males. In 1899, the Vancouver City Hospital Training School for Nurses was opened. In 1902, British Columbia provincial legislature transferred control from the city's board of health to a board of 15 directors. Vancouver City Hospital was renamed to Vancouver General Hospital.
In 1906, in Fairview Ridge, overlooking False Creek, a new building, the Heather Pavilion, began housing staff and patients. The University of British Columbia Medical School opened clinical facilities at VGH in 1950.
In 1959, VGH opened the ""Centennial Pavilion"" (named in commemoration of the centennial of the founding of British Columbia as a British Crown colony, in 1858), which at the time was the largest part of the VGH facilities.
In the 1960s, VGH build Canada's first intensive care nursery, equipped with the first effective apparatus used for natural breathing in infants with respiratory failure.
In 1996, VGH opened the first three floors of its newly constructed Laurel Pavilion. In 2000, the Laurel Pavilion was renamed to the Jim Pattison Pavilion and construction of the final 12 floors began in 2001. The Jim Pattison Pavilion opened in 2003.
In 2004, the ground-breaking for new Gordon and Leslie Diamond Health Care Centre began. This new building, adjacent to the Jim Pattison Pavilion, opened in August 2006 to provide acute day care services in a variety of areas.
The Lung Centre specializes in the treatment of pulmonary conditions such as asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, occupational and environmental lung diseases, sarcoidosis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, pulmonary hypertension and interstitial lung disease.
The Blusson Spinal Cord Centre, the world’s largest, most advanced and most comprehensive facility devoted to spinal cord injury research and patient care was opened in November 2008. The six-storey, $45-million centre is home to ICORD (International Collaboration on Repair Discoveries), the Rick Hansen Institute and the Brenda and Davide McLean Integrated Spine Clinic and is a partnership of the University of British Columbia, the Rick Hansen Foundation, Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute, and the VGH & UBC Hospital Foundation.
The Robert H.N. Ho Research Centre, opened in September 2011, is a seven-storey, 69,350 sq ft (6,443 m2) facility that houses three of VGH’s key research programs: the Vancouver Prostate Centre at VGH; the Centre for Hip Health and Mobility; and the Ovarian Cancer Research Initiative.


== Facilities and amenities ==

VGH is the largest hospital in British Columbia, offering specialized and tertiary services to adult patients (18 and above) in Vancouver. The hospital accepts patients referred from other parts of the province requiring highly specialized services. Approximately 40% of the hospital's cases come from outside the Vancouver region. Vancouver General Hospital is an internal medicine hospital, with pediatric and maternal care services in the Vancouver region being offered by BC Children's Hospital and BC Women's Hospital & Health Centre.

In addition to providing specialized and tertiary medical services, VGH is also a teaching hospital in affiliation with the University of British Columbia Faculty of Medicine, providing training and advanced education to students from all disciplines. Unique in Canada is the Gordon and Leslie Diamond Health Care Centre at VGH which includes the UBC Faculty of Medicine facilities. The facility houses teaching space for about 250 third and fourth year medical students and 500 postgraduate residents, and nine Faculty of Medicine programs as well as the UBC medical school library.
VGH's main cafeteria, Sassafras Cafeteria, is located on the second floor of the Jim Pattison Pavilion. The Jim Pattison Pavilion also has a café at its main entrance called Café Ami.

230,"English Bay, Vancouver","English Bay is located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, west of the downtown peninsula and False Creek. It consists of the south side of the Burrard Inlet, extending from Point Grey in the southwest to Prospect Point in the northeast.


== Location ==
English Bay Beach, near the city's West End residential neighbourhood, is a popular sunbathing, swimming, and sunset-watching beach in the downtown Vancouver area. Other downtown beaches facing English Bay include Sunset Beach, Second Beach, and Third Beach. Along the south shore of the bay lie Kitsilano Beach, Jericho Beach, Locarno Beach, and the Spanish Banks beaches, while on the North Shore are Ambleside Beach and various smaller cove-beaches in the city of West Vancouver. The beaches facing English Bay are a major tourist attraction all year long, with the peak season being late summer.
The Vancouver Seawall runs all the way around English Bay from Stanley Park in the northeast around False Creek at Point Grey facing the Strait of Georgia in the southwest. This is a favourite destination for walkers, runners, bicyclists, and roller-bladers. (Note: the Seawall is one-way for cyclists and roller-bladers, running counter-clockwise from just east of Lions Gate Bridge to Third Beach.)
English Bay Beach is host to a number of public events. The Celebration of Light is a fireworks competition that is held for two weeks every summer (usually the last week in July and first week in August). While this competition often struggles to secure funding, it has successfully run since 1990 and is the largest off-shore fireworks display in the world.  Each winter it is the host of Vancouvers' annual Polar Bear Swim and each summer the Vancouver Pride Parade and Festival is held on English Bay Beach.


== History ==
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, English Bay Beach was home to Vancouver's first official lifeguard, the legendary Joe Fortes, who taught hundreds of the city's early residents how to swim, and patrolled the beach from his cabin on its shore. Today, the waters of the bay are often dotted with hundreds of small pleasure boats, as well as huge freighters waiting at anchor to load cargoes at Vancouver's port.
The beach was the site of an oil spill in Vancouver on April 8, 2015.  The official cause of the spill has not been confirmed, but at least 2700 litres of ""bunker fuel"" are known to have escaped from a cargo ship into the bay.  The highly toxic oil later washed up on nearby beaches, creating a slick 15–20 cm thick.  At least twenty seabirds were injured or affected by the spill, but the full extent of any environmental and economic damage is unknown at this early stage.  The federal government was criticized for its response to the spill, including the delay in notifying the public of the health hazard, by the mayor and premier, environmental scientists, and an international shipping expert. Coast Guard officials defended the response, with regional director Assistant Commissioner Roger Girouard saying, ""it was exceptional"".The beaches were tested and most were reopened following a ten-day closure.  While the water and soil at most of the beaches tested was found not to have harmful levels of oil present, the government cautioned that ""small amounts"" of oil may remain, and urged people to be aware of the possible hazard and avoid contact with any oil.  The reopened beaches will continue to be tested and the need for further cleanup assessed as needed.

231,"Strathcona, Vancouver","Strathcona is Vancouver, British Columbia's oldest residential neighbourhood. It is bordered by Chinatown to the west, Clark Drive to the east, and Canadian National Railway and Great Northern Railway (now BNSF Railway) classification yards to the south. By some definitions, its northern border is the roads just south of Burrard Inlet, and much of the Downtown Eastside lies within Strathcona. By other definitions, Strathcona's northern boundary is just south of Hastings Street, and the Downtown Eastside is a separate neighbourhood to the north and northwest of Strathcona 


== History ==
Over 11,800 people live in Strathcona, which grew during the city's boom years between the city's founding in 1886 and 1920 due in large part to the choice of early Vancouver as a railway terminus. It emerged from the original settlement that grew around Hastings Mill. Originally called the East End, the neighbourhood adopted the name Strathcona in the 1960s. It has always been a working-class neighbourhood, and its residents have always been from many ethnic backgrounds. It is the only neighbourhood where English is not the most commonly spoken language, with 61% of residents reporting Chinese as their mother tongue, followed by English at 24%.The neighbourhood was earmarked for demolition in the 1950s as part of an urban renewal program. Strathcona would have been transformed into ""block upon block of identical apartments buildings and townhouses"" for social housing. The redevelopment plans proceeded with the construction of the MacLean Park housing development between Union, Keefer, Gore and Jackson, and Stamp's Place on Campbell between Hastings, Union and Raymur some 15 blocks of the neighbourhood were bulldozed including Hogan's Alley, the only area with a concentration of blacks in Vancouver. Development was stopped due to opposition from the community, led by residents such as Bessie Lee, Mary Lee Chan, her husband Walter Chan, and daughter Shirley Chan, who banded together to form the Strathcona Property Owners and Tenants Association (SPOTA). Important municipal figures such as mayor Mike Harcourt and the TEAM and later COPE party emerged from this movement.
In 1971, residents came into conflict with the north-south rail line that had bisected the neighbourhood since 1909. Mothers of children who attended Admiral Seymour Elementary School were concerned that trains often blocked the route that their children took to walk to school. This group, which became known as the Militant Mothers of Raymur, occupied the tracks, leading to the construction of a pedestrian/cyclist overpass at Keefer St.
Just as the neighbourhood organisers were making headway at preserving the neighbourhood, city engineers proposed putting a freeway through the southern part of the neighbourhood which would have connected to a proposed waterfront route. The connectors along Gore and Carrall Streets, would have partially destroyed Chinatown and Gastown.
The Mau Dan Gardens Co-operative was established in October 1981, the last of five projects initiated by the Strathcona Area Housing Society (SAHS) to provide housing for the residents of the Strathcona area whose homes were expropriated and demolished in the urban renewal clearance scheme of 1965.
In 1972, after protest by the local community, the city abandoned its plan to build a municipal fire hall on the vacant site and reserved the property known as site ""C & D"" for family housing. The land, owned by the City of Vancouver, is now leased to the Mau Dan Gardens Co-operative Housing Association.
The founding membership of the Co-operative was predominantly of Chinese ethnicity, but included families of Vietnamese, Cambodian, Japanese and Canadian origin.In recent years, Strathcona has been subjected to a significant gentrification process, reinforcing the economic disparity of the area. The late 19th and early 20th century architecture in the area is a relative rarity in Vancouver and many houses in Strathcona are designated heritage houses. This housing stock in particular is being renovated, thus raising property values and attracting wealthier home owners to the area. A number of homeowners have restored their houses in the original Victorian or Edwardian styles, with a particular attention to the ""true colours"" of the period, which in some cases has been supported by grants from the ""Restore It!"" program of ""Restore It!"" Program Vancouver Heritage Foundation


== Education ==
There are two public elementary schools located within Strathcona: Lord Strathcona and Admiral Seymour. Also named for Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal, Lord Strathcona Elementary was founded in 1891 and is the oldest school in Vancouver. The school is attached to a community centre and the school library formerly doubled as a branch of the Vancouver Public Library. Admiral Seymour Elementary was named in honour of Sir Edward Hobart Seymour, a former Admiral of the fleet of the Royal Navy. Strathcona is in the secondary school catchment area of Britannia Secondary School.
Vancouver Japanese Language School is also located in Strathcona. Established in 1906 as Vancouver Japanese Citizens School (晩香坡共立日本國民學校, Bankūbā Kyōritsu Nihon Kokumin Gakkō), it is the oldest Japanese school in Canada. Although properties owned by Japanese Canadians were forfeited by the government during World War II and were never returned, the school building on Alexander Street is the only property in Canada where half of the ownership was returned to the Japanese Canadian community after the internment. Vancouver Japanese Language School is offering Japanese immersion preschool as well as various Japanese language courses.


== Demographics ==
As of 2006, Strathcona has 11,920 people, a 3% increase from 2001. 13.5% of the population is under the age of 19; 23.5% is between 20 and 39; 38.9% is between 40 and 64; and 24.0% is 65 or older. 43.9% of Strathcona residents speak English as a first language, and 40.3% speak a Chinese language. The median household income is $15,558, and 59.4% of its population lives in low-income households. Its unemployment rate is 11.1%.

232,Maple Leaf Publishing,"Maple Leaf Publishing was a World War II-era Canadian comic book publisher active during the Golden Age of Comic Books. They were one of four publishers—along with Anglo-American Publishing, Hillborough Studios, and Bell Features—which published ""Canadian Whites""—black-and-white comic books with colour covers that proliferated during the war years when American imports were restricted. Maple Leaf Publishing started publishing comic books in March 1941 and went out of business in late 1946.
In contrast to the larger Anglo-American, which published many comics drawn by Canadians but based on imported American scripts, Maple Leaf focused on home-grown scripts. Maple Leaf's first publication, Better Comics #1, is thus considered to be the first true Canadian comic book.Maple Leaf's comics were modeled on the American format, minus the colour interiors. Notable titles other than Better Comics included Big Bang Comics, Lucky Comics and Rocket Comics.


== Titles published ==
Better Comics (34 issues, March 1941 - August/September 1946)
Bing Bang Comics (31 issues, November–December 1941 - May–June 1946)

233,City Square Shopping Centre,"City Square Shopping Centre is a mall across the street from City Hall in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is located in the heart of the heritage district of central Vancouver, on the northwest corner of 12th Avenue and Cambie Street.
City Square Shopping Mall and office complex was inaugurated in 1989 and is an example of adaptive reuse of heritage buildings.


== History ==
Unique to Vancouver, City Square's shopping mall and office complex is a mix of modern and heritage architecture. The heritage portions of the complex were built in 1905 and 1908 to house the Model School and Normal School, respectively. Graduates from the Teacher's Training Program applied their skills, norms (hence the name ""Normal School"") and educational theories at the Normal School to gain practical experience. In 1986 the City of Vancouver designated both school buildings as municipal heritage sites, saving them from demolition.


== City Square today ==
On the retail level, the shopping mall offers over 50 shops and professional services, including medical and dental offices, and a food court.

234,Ballantyne Pier,"Ballantyne Pier (also called the Ballantyne Cruise Terminal) is a commercial and passenger dock of the Port of Vancouver, Canada, located at 851 Centennial Road.  It sits at the west side of Rogers Sugar across the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks from Powell Street.  Passenger terminal access is via Clark Drive or McGill Street Overpass only.
In 1995, the pier was renovated to create two modern cruise ship berths: the East Berth (#1) is 366 metres (1,201 ft) and the West Berth (#2) is used as an overflow berth.  The dock is equipped with two automatic gangways and a terminal building with baggage handling and customs areas.The pier stopped cruise operations at the end of 2014.


== History ==

Ballantyne Pier was built in 1922-1923 by the Vancouver Harbour Board to alleviate dock shortages in Vancouver which came to a head during the First World War. Also, competing railways such as Canadian National Railways, Great Northern Railway of Canada, Canadian Northern Railway, and Grand Trunk Pacific Railway needed access to the CPR-monopolized waterfront, which was afforded by a CNR level junction. The Canadian National Steamship Company fleet sailed from this dock.
During the early construction foreman Edward J. Gorman died of injuries sustained during a pile driving accident. Mr. Gorman succumbed to his injuries on April 24, 1922.
The pier was the scene of a vicious 1935 strike, the Battle of Ballantyne Pier.
The dock was gutted in 1992 and rebuilt after a period of dis-use. Modern teflon sails and steelwork erupt from the original, beautiful Beaux Arts facade. It is now used as an overflow for cruise ships. Direct to cable TV productions such as Captain Courageous have been filmed there, uranium ships and the liberty ship SS Jeremiah O'Brien have also docked at the pier.

235,City of Vancouver Archives,"The City of Vancouver Archives is the City of Vancouver's official archival repository for government documents, as well as the home to many personal and corporate records telling the story of the community. The archives serves as the repository for historical records generated by the City of Vancouver, including the Mayor's Office, the Parks Board, the Board of Police Commissioners, the Vancouver Police Department, and the Office of the City Clerk. It also contains numerous collections from private donors, businesses, and community groups. The archives are part of the City Clerk's Department.


== History ==
The archives began as the personal collection of J. S. Matthews, who was born in Wales, and settled in Vancouver in 1898. For decades he collected and catalogued artifacts, solicited donations, interviewed early inhabitants of the young city, and wrote historical narratives.
The archives began in Major Matthews' home until he was eventually given space by the City in various locations and was officially made the City's archivist in 1933. He moved the collection back into his home for a period following a dispute with Mayor Gerry McGeer over ownership of the collection. The archives did not find a permanent home in his lifetime, but were given to the city with the condition of a dedicated building in his will within one year after his death in 1970.


== Facilities ==
The first space provided for the archives by the city was in the attic of the old City Hall on Main Street, in 1931. In 1933, the archives moved to the temporary City Hall in the Holden Building on East Hastings Street. In 1936, the archives moved again to the new City Hall at Cambie Street and West 12th Avenue. In 1959, the archives moved again to space in the Main Library on Burrard Street.The current archives building, located at 1150 Chestnut Street, is a semi-underground modern structure in Vanier Park, designed by Bill Leithead. When the building was opened in 1972, it was the first building in Canada built specifically as a city archive.

236,Vancouver City Hall,"Vancouver City Hall is home to Vancouver City Council in Vancouver, British Columbia. Located at 453 West 12th Avenue, the building was ordered by the Vancouver Civic Building Committee, designed by architect Fred Townley and Matheson, and built by Carter, Halls, Aldinger and Company. The building has a twelve-storey tower (the point being 323 feet/98 metres above sea level) with a clock on the top.
The building is served by the Broadway–City Hall station on SkyTrain's Canada Line.


== History ==
Between 1897 and 1929, the Vancouver City Hall was located on Main Street, just south of the Carnegie Library; that building had previously served as a public market and an auditorium. In 1929, City Hall moved into the Holden Building (built 1911), while the Main Street building became an extension of the Carnegie Library.After being elected mayor in 1934, Gerry McGeer appointed a three-man committee to select the location for a new city hall; choices included the former Central School site at Victory Square, and Strathcona Park at the corner of Cambie Street and West 12th Avenue (no relation to the current park in the Strathcona neighbourhood). The panel recommended the Strathcona Park site, and City Council approved the selection in 1935, making Vancouver the first major Canadian city to locate its city hall outside its downtown.

Construction of the new City Hall began in 1936 (Vancouver's Golden Jubilee) on January 3, and the first cornerstone was laid by McGeer on July 2. An eight-foot statue of Capt. George Vancouver, carved by Charles Marega, was placed at the front of the building. It was unveiled on August 20 by the visiting Lord Mayor of London, Sir Percy Vincent. Sir Percy also presented several gifts to the city, including a civic mace, and a sprig ""...from a tree in the orchard where a falling apple gave Isaac Newton the idea that led to his theory of gravity."" The mace and the statue still reside at city hall.
The building was started and opened all in the same year. Construction cost $1 million, and was completed on December 1, bringing an end to the 330-day construction. Each lock plate on the outer doors displays the Vancouver Coat of Arms, and each door knob bears the monogram of the building. The ceiling on the second floor of the rotunda was made of gold leaf from several BC mines.
After winning the civic election on December 9, 1936, George Clark Miller became the first mayor of Vancouver to occupy the brand-new city hall on January 2, 1937.
A four-storey east wing was added in 1968 (completed in 1970) and in 2012 city staff gradually started moving out when a study found it would not withstand an earthquake. In 1969 a coat of arms added and the original building was declared a Schedule A heritage building (i.e. of primary significance) in March 1976.

243,Zulu Records,"Zulu Records is a Canadian record store and independent record label, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, that sells new and used CDs, LPs, 45s, turntables and concert tickets and is currently located at 1972 West 4th Avenue. One of the most famous independent record stores in Canada, Zulu was a finalist in CBC Radio 3's Searchlight contest to name Canada's best record store.


== History ==
Zulu Records was started in 1981 by Grant McDonagh, who had been an employee of Quintessence Records.  When Quintessence Records ceased operations as both an independent record store and independent record label, McDonagh continued operations in a similar fashion, as Zulu Records.Zulu frequently hosts free in-store performances which have included Julie Doiron, Billy Bragg, Dean Wareham, Chad Vangaalen, The XX, Kurt Vile, Lou Barlow, Kid Koala, Jay Reatard, Grouper, José González, Superchunk, Hawksley Workman, The War on Drugs, Rodriguez, Jonathan Richman, Yo La Tengo and Frog Eyes among others.
In 2011, Zulu Records began selling DVDs and Blu-rays in partnership with Videomatica video store.Zulu Records has often been called the birthplace of the indie rock genre ""Cuddlecore"" as the term was coined by long term employee and local indie music hero Nicolas Bragg, best known for his work as a guitarist in the Vancouver rock group Destroyer. In addition to Bragg, Zulu has housed many employees who have played in legendary Vancouver bands. These include: Cub, The Christa Min, The Nasty On, The Cinch, Anemones, The Book of Lists, Weed, Ali Milner, Fuck Me USA, The Shilohs, Victoria, Victoria!, Leviathans, Cowards, Womankind, Pink Mountaintops, Baron Samedi, Connecticut, Magneticring, Blaise Pascal, Blues Crab, Old Mutton and others.
In the early 2000s, Zulu employees formed a super-group amongst themselves known as The Countless Jibes. The band is best remembered for their multitude of members (often up to ten), multiple guitar attack and such classic rock gems as ""Jibes Alright"", ""Jibes'll Ride"" and ""Going For Dead"". Throughout the years they have shared the stage with many successful bands including Mudhoney, The Decemberists and The Walkmen. Unfortunately due to the vacation of key members from the city, most notably lead vocalist Jason Grimmer and bassist Steven Balogh, the Jibes disbanded in late 2008. Talks of a reunion have occurred in passing but no plans have been made yet.
In 2011 Zulu celebrated 30 years in business.


== Record label ==
The store also previously operated an independent record label, releasing albums by Vancouver artists such as Bob's Your Uncle, Sook-Yin Lee, Slow, Nomeansno and Perfume Tree as well as compilations by The Pointed Sticks, Young Canadians and The Modernettes.

244,"Mount Pleasant, Vancouver","Mount Pleasant is a neighbourhood in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, stretching from Cambie Street to Clark Drive and from Great Northern Way and 2nd, to 16th and Kingsway. The neighbourhood, once characterized as working-class, has undergone a process of gentrification since the early 1990s, including the area around the Main Street and Broadway intersection.
The neighbourhood is served by the Canada Line, an extension of SkyTrain from Downtown Vancouver to Vancouver International Airport.
Mount Pleasant is known as one of the more up and coming neighbourhoods, especially in the communities surrounding Vancouver's downtown peninsula. Many first-time homeowners and young professionals, as well as a growing number of families, call Mount Pleasant home.  It is also home to a number of artists and writers, including CBC personalities Ian Hanomansing and Tod Maffin, The Tyee editor David Beers and documentary filmmaker Peter W. Klein.


== History ==
Mount Pleasant owes much of its origins to a former stream and, because of it, developed much of its unique and rich character. The stream attracted a number of breweries from 1888 to 1912, hence it became known as Brewery Creek. In 1890, the first street cars arrived; as far south as 1st and Main. Brewery Creek, in conjunction with the connecting routes of Main and Kingsway, became the centre of industry and commercialism for the district of Mt. Pleasant. By 1897, there was a substantial population growth centred on Broadway and Main Street. The ability to commute to the City Centre and the industries of Brewery Creek and False Creek provided the draw for many working families that now populated the area below Broadway. In a sense, Mount Pleasant can be called Vancouver's ""first suburb"". 
The area high above False Creek was named ""Mount Pleasant"" in 1888, after the Irish birthplace of Jane Fortune Kemp the wife of Henry Valentine Edmonds. Edmonds, clerk of the municipal council in New Westminster, was the original owner of much of Mount Pleasant.


== Demographics ==
As of 2016, Mt. Pleasant has 32,955 people. 11.3% of the population is under the age of 20; 49.3% is between 20 and 39; 30.9% is between 40 and 64; and 8.6% is 65 or older. 69.9% of Mt. Pleasant residents speak English as a first language, 7.7% speak a Chinese language, and 3.0% speak Tagalog. The median household income is $66,299 and 15.7% of its population lives in low-income households. The unemployment rate is 4.7%.

245,Holy Trinity Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral,"Holy Trinity Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral is a Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on East 10th Avenue just west of Main Street.


== History ==
The Holy Trinity Ukrainian Orthodox Parish was established in Vancouver, on May 9, 1937. The first Holy Liturgy was held on July 18, 1937 at the Ukrainian National Home. The following year, a fund was established for the building of a church.  World War II, Federal Government statutes and policies, and the sheer size of the project they had undertaken were obstacles.  Ultimately the structure was designed by architect Serhyj Tymoshenko and built.  The Cross for the main cupola was blessed by Rev. Stephen Symchych on September 11, 1949.
At Easter 1950 the first Divine Liturgy was served in the newly built, but as yet unfinished, church. In the ensuing years the church was completed and decorated according to the Orthodox tradition.
In 1970 the parish commenced planning and fundraising for the building of an auditorium and mezzanine immediately adjacent to the church property.  The Ukrainian Orthodox Auditorium was officially opened on June 17, 1973.  
In December 1977, the Vancouver City Council designated the church as an architectural Heritage Building, and an engraved plaque was placed on the exterior of the church building.  In 1975 the church was designated as a Sobor by Rt. Rev. Archbishop Andrew on behalf of the Ukrainian Greek-Orthodox Church of Canada,(renamed Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada (UOCC) by an Act of Parliament in 1990).  In 1983 the church was designated a Cathedral.  Since its first Liturgy, the Parish has been served by fourteen priests, and had had visitations from bishops, archbishops and metropolitans of the UOCC.
The Church Elders and Sisterhood are involved with the care and maintenance of the church, along with their principal role of assisting with the conduct of church services.


== Congregation ==
The congregation is currently made up of approximately 130 members. There are many young families that have children in both Sunday and Ukrainian School. There is a mixture of both Ukrainian and English speaking parishioners, with many new immigrants from Ukraine who have joined the Parish for the welcoming atmosphere


== Ukrainian Orthodox Centre ==
Attached to the Holy Trinity Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral Parish is the Ukrainian Orthodox Centre which is used for a variety of uses - wedding receptions, anniversary celebrations, trade shows, presentations and meetings.


== Friday night suppers ==
The Parish is known in the Vancouver area for their Friday Night Ukrainian Suppers (also more commonly known as ""Perogy Night in Vancouver"") held on the first Friday of the month. The dinners have been featured on CBC and the Georgia Straight

246,Great Northern Way Campus,"Great Northern Way Campus Ltd (GNWC) is a private limited company and educational enterprise located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is the offspring of a consortium of four local academic institutions (the University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University, Emily Carr University of Art and Design and the British Columbia Institute of Technology, each of whom own a 25% interest in the company) that has attracted significant public and private funding. The company is the trustee of the Great Northern Way Campus Trust, whose stated purpose is to create ""a centre of convergence for arts and culture, digital media and the environment."" At present, it manages a Master's degree in Digital Media, which admitted its first students in the Fall of 2007.
The GNWC Trust has two principal activities: operating the Centre for Digital Media, which offers the Masters of Digital Media graduate degree, and revitalizing its land parcel to bring together business, academia and the general community into an emerging district for the digital and creative sectors. Eight projects, which include both new construction and renovations of existing buildings, are underway and several businesses in the digital media sector currently rent space on the campus.


== History ==
In 2001, the industrial distributor Finning International donated 7.5 hectares (19 acres) of former industrial land in the False Creek flats area of Vancouver to the GNWC Trust formed by the four academic partner institutions, though Finning retained a 20% interest in the site.  No public money was spent, and the declared aim was ""to cover the costs of future educational programs and buildings at the False Creek flats with revenues generated by private sector development.""  Beyond the tax write-off advantages, Finning also hoped that a further four-acre site that it kept for itself would now ""be easier to market because of the university component.""  In the words of Bob Laurie, Finning's real estate consultant: ""We're not philanthropists. We're looking at creating shareholder value and that's what I think we've done today.""By way of a trust deed, dated September 15, 2002, management and development of the property was delegated by the four partner institutions to a limited company to act as their trustee, Great Northern Way Campus Ltd.
A Shareholder's Agreement governs the Trustee and stipulates that one representative of each shareholder will sit on the Trustee's Board, along with up to eight other directors, to guide the Trustee's activities. The board chair is Morgan Sturdy, ""a high tech entrepreneur"" and director of Discovery Parks Inc. The company's president is Matthew Carter, who ""has an extensive background in real estate finance and development."" In 2006 the Province gave $40 million as an endowment fund to establish the Centre for Digital Media. The Government's objective with this funding was to build Vancouver's prominence as a digital media hub. Among other things, this included launching a Masters of Digital Media (MDM) graduate degree program that would be operated by the Trustee and issue a degree credentialed by all four partners. The Trustee has outsourced operational management of the MDM program to SFU under a Management Services Agreement.
As of 2012, GNWC President Matthew Carter claimed that its academic program would break even financially (previously it had been running a deficit in the order of $388,000 per year), and the debt incurred from the site acquisition would be repaid.In January 2013, British Columbia premier Christy Clark announced the province's intention to fund a $130 million relocation of the Emily Carr University of Art and Design to the GNWC property.
In April 2017, Catherine Warren was appointed president of Great Northern Way Trust. In 2018, Great Northern Way adapted and no longer has a president.


== Centre for Digital Media ==

The Centre for Digital Media is described as  together business, academia and the general community into an emerging district for the digital and creative sectors in Vancouver, British Columbia.  It offers a full-time Masters of Digital Media program and a part-time version, the Executive Masters of Digital Media, as well as student housing. The area immediately surrounding the Centre has office space for digital media companies, which not only recoups revenue but is also meant to facilitate the interaction between the Centre and the digital media industry.


== Digital media industry ==
Space at the GNWC complex is occupied by the four partner academic institutions, plus a number of commercial tenants and student housing.
From 2012 onwards, GNWC has had commercial tenants that are aligned with the Trust’s vision for the campus, including Scalar Decisions, Blackbird Interactive, GRAND (Graphics, Animation and New Media Canada), Discovery Parks’ Generator, Conquer Mobile, and Image Engine.In 2012, Image Engine partnered with Rainmaker Entertainment Inc. and Digital Domain and received financial backing from Toronto-based Scalar Decisions to set up a render farm at GNWC. Dubbed ‘RenderCloud,’ the facility’s goal is to offer scalable, high-end VFX development capabilities to major movie studios, and prevent them from being lured away to competitors in countries such as New Zealand and England. The RenderCloud facility is leasing 3,500 square feet of space from GNWC at reportedly ‘favorable’ rates.Academic research projects that rent space at GNWC include BCIT's Centre for the Advancement of Green Roof Technology. BCIT also offers trades and apprenticeship programs and courses at GNWC.
In addition, UBC Properties Trust and the Justice Institute of British Columbia have offices at the GNWC district. Some space is also rented for artistic production and rehearsal purposes.  For example,  eatART, a charity that fosters new media art research with a focus on large-scale, kinetic and robotic sculpture, resides in a shop on the property. Also, the Equinox and Monte Clark Galleries opened a location on the GNWC property in 2012 and are now located in the 525 building.
GNWC has hosted several film productions and special events. These include LANcouver, which was held at the warehouse in the Centre for Digital Media in May 2011, and Mini Maker Faire Vancouver, which was held at the same location in June 2011.


== Property development ==
GNWC earns most of its income from property management and has announced ambitious plans to redevelop its property. The land is to be divided into three subdistricts: the Centre for Digital Media, Art Park District, and the home of a relocated Emily Carr University of Art and Design.
GNWC built a new Centre for Digital Media building on the east side of the property. The building includes teaching facilities, office space, meeting and event spaces and 76 student housing units. It opened in September 2012.At the west side of the property, the GNWC recently sold two land parcels to Onni Development Ltd., on which it plans to build approximately 200 residential and artist studio units on one parcel, and live/work units on the other. The revenue generated by the sale of land is being used to pay off debt accrued from purchasing the property and establishing the Masters of Digital Media program.
Further revenue generated from investments and property rental income will be put towards an endowment enhancement fund that will be used to fund MDM student scholarships, CDM-branded events to bring students and the digital media industry professionals together, as well as future on-site developments that align with the Trust’s vision.

247,Stanley Industrial Alliance Stage,"The Stanley Industrial Alliance Stage (formerly the Stanley Theatre) is a landmark theatre at 12th Avenue and Granville Street in Vancouver, British Columbia which serves as the main stage for the Arts Club Theatre Company. The Stanley first opened as a movie theatre in December 1930, and showed movies for over sixty years before falling revenues led to its closure in 1991. After years of threatened commercial redevelopment, the Stanley was renovated as a stage theatre in 1997–1998 and subsequently awarded status as a heritage building.
As a stage for the Arts Club, the Stanley has been used to put on classics, Broadway musicals and other large productions, including Swing!,  My Fair Lady, Miss Saigon, Disney's Beauty and the Beast and Irving Berlin's White Christmas. The theatre, which went through major fundraising to finance its renovations and mortgage, at one stage lost its sponsor du Maurier due to tobacco regulations, but in 2005 received new sponsorship from Industrial Alliance Pacific Life Insurance Company and the theatre's name was changed to the Stanley Industrial Alliance Stage.


== Movie theatre ==
The Stanley opened on December 15, 1930. Originally envisioned as a vaudeville venue, it was built by Frederick Guest, owner of a chain of theatres in Ontario, who reportedly fell in love with Vancouver and decided to build his dream theatre there. He hired Henry Holdsby Simmonds as the architect, who designed it with a neoclassical interior and an Art Deco exterior, with seating for 1,216 people. In order to make as high quality a theatre as possible, Simmonds used only the best materials he could find, including tindle stone from Winnipeg and tiles from Italy, along with chandeliers, carpets and furnishings from local merchants. Like the Stanley Cup and Stanley Park, the theatre was named after Governor General of Canada Lord Stanley.The first film shown at the Stanley was One Romantic Night, starring Lillian Gish. Admission was originally between 10 and 40 cents. The vertical Stanley sign was added in 1940 and the stylized Stanley script came in 1957. The cinema, which had been part of the Granville Theatre Company, was bought by Famous Players in 1941 for $268,000.The Stanley was originally built as a neighbourhood theatre, but gradually became more popular and attracted moviegoers from throughout the Vancouver region. From the 1950s onwards, progressively improved sound and projection systems along with refurbished seating added to the theatre's appeal. On July 8, 1954 the Stanley began showing films in stereophonic CinemaScope for the first time. By December 1958, the theatre had a DP70 70mm projector, and the Stanley was advertised as ""the only Todd-AO theatre in Western Canada"". By October 1978, the auditorium was equipped with Dolby Stereo, and by December 1985 its sound system was upgraded and certified to THX quality assurance standards.

The Stanley often showed blockbusters. Some movies shown at the theatre through the years included The Exorcist, The Towering Inferno,The Muppet Movie, Apocalypse Now, The Empire Strikes Back, The Elephant Man, Poltergeist, The Right Stuff, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Top Gun, Empire of the Sun, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and Goodfellas.Revenues declined during the late 20th century, and Famous Players closed the Stanley, which was by then the oldest operating movie theatre in Vancouver, on September 25, 1991 after a final showing of the Stanley regular Fantasia; the theatre had previously shown Fantasia at least four times, in 1977, 1979, 1980–1981, and 1990. Its closure was part of a long trend: The number of Famous Players theatres had dropped from 419 in 1954 to 196 in 1969, and would fall to eighty, some in partnership with other companies, by the time it was taken over by Cineplex Galaxy Entertainment in 2005. Other Vancouver-area Famous Players movie theatres closed, sold or torn down in this period included the Fine Arts (1989), Denman Place (1989), Park Royal (1993), the Park (2005), and the Capitol 6 (2005).


== Renovation ==
Famous Players put the Stanley up for sale in the spring of 1991, with the condition that it not be used as a movie theatre. In the months leading up to the Stanley's closure, Famous Players had a conditional sale agreement for the theatre with Vancouver developer Sandy Cox, who was planning to keep the Stanley's facade and convert the interior into retail space. The Vancouver City Council received a proposal to change the building to retail use, which it approved, but the planned development was abandoned, and the building remained vacant for several years. During the early 1990s, a ""Save Our Stanley"" campaign was begun to preserve the building and prevent commercial redevelopment of the space. In 1994, the Stanley Theatre Society was formed to try to buy the Stanley for the Arts Club Theatre Company, and in 1997 it purchased the theatre from Famous Players for $3,173,000. Renovation costs, including sound and lighting equipment, came to $5.8 million, which brought the costs of purchase and renovation to about $9 million, $1.5 million more than the $7.5 million originally budgeted. Money came from fundraising campaigns by the Arts Club and Vancouver TheatreSports, at least $3.9 million from the provincial and federal government, a $100,000 grant from the City of Vancouver, the purchase of a density transfer to the One Wall Centre by Peter Wall for $1.2 million, as well as corporate sponsorship by du Maurier, although du Maurier would later withdraw as a sponsor because of federal restrictions on tobacco advertising.

Architects including Thom Weeks and Jennifer Stanley led renovations of the Stanley into a live theatre. Weeks was initially disappointed with the state of the pre-renovated theatre, which looked ""pretty tired"" with its aged orange walls and sticky, soft drink-stained carpets. However, by the time the renovations were completed, and the actors and musicians were getting ready to first perform in it, there was a general feeling of excitement about the theatre. Renovations included expansion of the lobby, reconfiguration of the balcony, an expansion of the stage to twice its original size, a new twenty-five metre fly tower from which to raise and lower scenery, new dressing rooms, a trap room, an electrical room and a green room backstage, a reduction of the number of seats from 1,216 to 650, a crush bar in the old projection booth, a section cut out of the theatre's dome to use for spotlights, and a full restoration of the theatre's gold-leafed plaster decorations. As a result of these renovations, in 1999 the theatre was awarded a City of Vancouver Heritage Award, as well as an IES International Illumination Design Award.


=== Effects on the local area ===
A 2003 study claimed the Stanley's renovation brought positive economic effects to the theatre's local area, bounded by 8th Street and 17th between Fir and Hemlock. According to the study, this area became more of a leisure/recreation destination, with many new culturally related businesses, retail stores and service-related businesses opening. An increase in overall sales was noted and 76% of surveyed residents responded that the theatre's reopening had a positive effect on the community. Business respondents also reportedly had a positive view of the theatre's effects.


== Live stage ==

After renovation, owing to du Maurier's sponsorship, the facility was named the Stanley Theatre du Maurier Stage, taken over by the Arts Club Theatre Company and later became their main stage. This venue has allowed the Arts Club to put on new kinds of shows, such as large musicals, classics and productions from around the world. The first production was Swing!, which opened on October 28, 1998 and had a successful run, followed by Hamlet. In addition to showing Arts Club productions, the theatre is rented out for other purposes, including business and educational presentations, and has been used for comedy acts and concerts, such as Lorne Elliott, Francis Cabrel, and RyanDan.By 2005 du Maurier had withdrawn as a sponsor and, along with its over-budget renovation costs, the Stanley was left with a $2 million mortgage. That year Industrial Alliance Pacific Life Insurance Company made a $1.5 million donation, and on April 5 the theatre was renamed the Stanley Industrial Alliance Stage for the next twenty years.

248,Dude Chilling Park,"Dude Chilling Park is a sign installation, originally created as a prank, which now has official public art status in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is located at the 2300 block of Brunswick Street in the Mount Pleasant area of Vancouver in Guelph Park. The sign is located on the southwest corner of the park.


== History ==
In November 2012, the sign was created as a prank by local artist Viktor Briestensky, as a light-hearted reference to Reclining Figure, a public art piece by Michael Dennis installed in Guelph Park in 1991. Vancouver Park Board staff removed the sign, but local resident Dustin Bromley launched an online petition to save the sign. After 1,500 signatures of support, the Parks Board decided to reinstall the sign permanently on February 27, 2014, because it celebrates the unique characteristics of the park and neighbouring community. In September 2014, the installation was stolen but has since been replaced.


== Popular culture ==

International attention for Dude Chilling Park included American late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel who said ""Between Dude Chilling Park and Mayor Ford, I might have to move to Canada."" R&B Brewing, a local Vancouver brewery, created ""Dude Chilling Pale Ale"" in their year-round line-up as a tribute.

249,Port of Vancouver (1964–2008),"The Port of Vancouver was the name of the largest port in Canada, the largest in the Pacific Northwest, and the largest port on the West Coast of North America by metric tons of total cargo, with 76.5 million metric tons. The port amalgamated with the Fraser River Port Authority and the North Fraser Port Authority in 2008 to form Port Metro Vancouver.
In terms of container traffic measured in twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU), the port ranked in 2006 as the largest port in Canada, the largest in the Pacific Northwest, the fourth-largest port on the West Coast of North America, and fifth-largest in North America overall.The Port of Vancouver trades $43 billion in goods with more than 90 trading economies annually. The Vancouver Fraser Port Authority is the corporation responsible for management of the port, which, in addition to the city of Vancouver, includes all of Burrard Inlet and Roberts Bank Superport in Delta.
The Port of Vancouver is also the world hub for Canadian shipping company, Asia Pacific Marine Container Lines.


== Terminals ==
The port has 25 major marine terminals: three container, seventeen bulk cargo and five break bulk cargo.

Centerm
Vanterm
Lynnterm
Neptune
Fraser Surrey Docks
DeltaportThe Centerm container and break bulk terminals are leased by P&O Ports, which was acquired by Dubai Ports World in 2005.


== Economic impact ==
The port generates 30,100 direct jobs through its activities. Employment is generated by five sectors related to the port: maritime cargo, cruise industry, capital investment in port facilities, shipbuilding and repair, and non-maritime enterprises. Maritime cargo is the largest of these sectors, generating more than 21,000 direct jobs. The cruise sector is the next largest, generating almost 5,600 direct jobs. Factoring in the multiplier effects (including indirect jobs), the port has a total employment impact of 69,200 jobs across all five sectors. The jobs created by the port pay on average 52% higher than the average wage in British Columbia.
The port contributed $1.8 billion in direct GDP and $4.1 billion in direct economic output to the Canadian economy in 2004. When multiplier effects are taken into account, these figures increase to $4.0 billion in GDP and $8.9 billion in economic output. The port's economic impact extends into Western Canada and beyond, with most of the exports shipped through the port produced outside of Greater Vancouver, and many of the imports intended for markets outside of the Lower Mainland.
The port is the home port for the Vancouver–Alaska cruise, which occurs annually from May to September, with more than 1 million revenue passengers on about 300 sailings passing through the port's two cruise terminals, Canada Place and Ballantyne. In 2006 the port hosted 28 ships at its two cruise terminals.


== Statistics ==
In 2006 the port handled 79.4 million tonnes, up 4% from 76.5 million tonnes in 2005. In 2005 the port handled 1.7 million total containers, 910,172 cruise passengers, and 105,246 foreign vessels.
In 2005 the port's top import and export partner nations were:


== Container terminal expansion ==

Studies indicate that container traffic on the West Coast of North America is expected to triple in the next 20 years. The Port of Vancouver has the opportunity to capture nearly 7-million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) by 2020. In order to meet future requirements, the VPA has examined options to increase the port's container terminal capacity. In August 2002, the VPA announced the beginning of the process. The VPA is looking at a three-pronged approach to increasing container capacity at the Port of Vancouver:

Efficiencies at existing terminals
Expansion at existing terminals
Building new facilitiesHowever, the Port of Prince Rupert is also looking to capture the expected increase in container traffic. While both Vancouver and Prince Rupert have direct rail lines to major U.S. destinations such as Chicago, the location of Prince Rupert has the logistical advantage of being closer to major Asian ports.


== History ==
With the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, Vancouver's seaport was able to compete with the major international ports for global trade because it was positioned as an alternative route to Europe. During the 1920s, the provincial government successfully fought to eliminate freight rates that discriminated against goods transported by rail through the mountains, giving the young lawyer of the case, future Vancouver Mayor and Canadian senator, Gerry McGeer, a reputation as “the man who flattened the Rockies.” Consequently, Prairie wheat came west through Vancouver rather than being shipped out through eastern ports. The federal government established the Harbour Commission (forerunner to the Port Authority) in the early 1920s to oversee port development. With its completion in 1923, Ballantyne Pier was the most technologically advanced port in the British Empire. The CPR, lumber exporters, terminal operators, and other companies based on the waterfront banded together after World War I to establish the Shipping Federation of British Columbia as an employers’ association to manage industrial relations on the increasingly busy waterfront. The Federation fought vociferously against unionization, defeating a series of strikes and breaking unions until the determined longshoremen established the current ILWU local after the Second World War. By the 1930s, commercial traffic through the port had become the largest sector in Vancouver's economy.


=== Merger ===
On January 1, 2008, the Port of Vancouver officially amalgamated with two other local port authorities, the North Fraser Port Authority and the Fraser River Port Authority, into a new organization, called the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority.

250,Duthie Books,"Duthie Books was a chain of bookstores operating in Vancouver from 1957-2010. It was founded by Bill Duthie, ""a storied bookseller who championed authors and wheeled-and-dealed with publishers, becoming a fixture on the Canadian literary scene.""  The stores were run by his three children – Cathy, Celia, and David – following his death in 1984. The first store opened on Robson Street near the public library. The shop had expanded to locations on W. 10th Avenue, Seymour Street, Hastings Street, and the Arbutus Village by the time of Duthie's death. A series of expansions through the 1990s led to a peak of ten shops throughout the city, but also left the bookseller in poor financial condition. The company declared bankruptcy in 1999. A single store remained open at 2239 West 4th Avenue, which closed in January 2010, causing widespread commentary about the death of this landmark Vancouver book store.

It is scheduled to open in 2025.The station will provide a connection to the Arbutus Greenway. Passengers continuing to the University of British Columbia (UBC) will have to transfer to a 99 B-Line bus to continue west along Broadway. As the planned new eastern terminus of the 99 B-Line, the station design includes a bus loop. There have been proposals to extend the Millennium Line all the way to UBC, but as of May 2020, funding for that portion of the project had not been committed.

252,Burrard Inlet,"Burrard Inlet (French: Baie Burrard) is a relatively shallow-sided coastal fjord in southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Formed during the last Ice Age, it separates the City of Vancouver and the rest of the low-lying Burrard Peninsula (to the south) from the slopes of the North Shore Mountains, home to the communities of West Vancouver and the City and District of North Vancouver.


== History ==
What is now known as Burrard Inlet has been home to the Indigenous peoples of the Musqueam, Squamish people and Tsleil-waututh, who have resided in this territory for thousands of years. In 1791, the first European explorers in the region, Juan Carrasco and José María Narváez, sailing under orders of Francisco de Eliza, entered the western part of the inlet in their ship, the Santa Saturnina. They failed to find the Fraser River, mistaking the lowland of the river's delta as a major inlet of the sea, which they named Canal de Floridablanca. This led to one of the prime objectives of the 1792 expedition of Dionisio Alcalá Galiano, which was to determine the exact nature of the Canal de Floridablanca. Galiano spent many days exploring the general area, realizing that there was a great river there and sighting Burrard Inlet itself on June 19, 1792. Just days later, the inlet was again named by Captain George Vancouver, after his friend and former shipmate Captain (later Admiral) Sir Harry Burrard.In 1888, the inlet was described in The British Columbia Pilot published by the British Admiralty as follows.

Burrard inlet differs from most of the great sounds of this coast in being comparatively easy of access to steam vessels of any size or class, and in the convenient depth of water for anchorage which may be found in almost every part of it; its close proximity to Fraser river, with the great facilities for constructing roads between the two places, and its having become the terminus of the Pacific and Canadian Railway, likewise add considerably to its importance. It is divided into three distinct harbours, viz., English bay or the outer anchorage; Vancouver (formerly called Coal harbour), above the First Narrows; and Port Moody at the head of the eastern arm of the inlet.


== Geography ==
The inlet runs almost directly east from the Strait of Georgia to Port Moody. About two-thirds of the way east from the mouth of the inlet, the steep-sided Indian Arm branches off to the north between Belcarra and Deep Cove on into the Pacific Ranges.
Near the mouth of the inlet, a small section of the inlet along the curved stretch of the Burrard Peninsula is named English Bay. From English Bay, a small inlet named False Creek branches off to the east and incises the peninsula.


=== Extent ===
The extent of Burrard Inlet is defined as a line between Point Atkinson and Point Grey on the west, the end of Port Moody Arm on the east, and the head of Indian Arm on the north. The inlet is about 31 kilometres (19 mi) long from the Strait of Georgia to Port Moody, or about 44 kilometres (27 mi) from the Strait of Georgia to the head of Indian Arm.


== Settlements ==
Settlements on the shores of Burrard Inlet include Vancouver, West Vancouver, North Vancouver, Burnaby, and Port Moody. Three bridges, the First Narrows Bridge (alias Lions Gate Bridge) (built in the 1930s), the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing (1960) and the CNR railway bridge (1969) at the Second Narrows, and the SeaBus passenger ferry, cross the inlet. Aside from just east of the inlet's mouth (where it includes English Bay), it is widest (about 3 km or 1.9 mi) between the First and Second Narrows, also the busiest part of Vancouver's port.


== Port of Vancouver ==

Protected from the open ocean, the calm waters of Burrard Inlet form Vancouver's primary port area, an excellent one for large ocean-going ships. While some of the shoreline is residential and commercial, much is port-industrial, including railyards, terminals for container and bulk cargo ships, grain elevators, and (towards the eastern end) oil refineries. Freighters waiting to load or discharge cargoes in the inlet often anchor in English Bay, which lies south of the mouth of the inlet and is separated from it by Vancouver's downtown peninsula and Stanley Park.
On the main inlet, a few park areas remain forested as they were centuries ago, but the steep slopes of Indian Arm are so impassable that most have seen no development, despite the proximity of such a major city. Only in 2003 was a rough wilderness hiking trail around the whole of Indian Arm completed, and it was the work of one man over many years.

253,Congregation Schara Tzedeck,"Congregation Schara Tzedeck is an Orthodox synagogue in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. A place of worship in Greater Vancouver, it is the oldest synagogue and the largest Orthodox synagogue in the city. Its name is Hebrew for ""Gates of Righteousness"".
Founded in 1907, it was originally known as ""Benei Yehuda"" and was located at East Pender Street at Heatley Street in the Strathcona neighbourhood, then the focus of the city's Jewish community. Francis George Gardiner, architect's drawings of the Schara Tzedeck synagogue, circa 1920 are at Vancouver City Archives.Its present rabbi is Rabbi Andrew Rosenblatt. Congregation Schara Tzedeck celebrated its centennial in 2007. The congregation has a diverse membership, with many multi-generational families and long-time members. It is located at 3476 Oak Street, Vancouver, BC. Notable members included David Oppenheimer, entrepreneur and second Mayor of Vancouver, who donated the land for the original site.
The synagogue holds daily prayer services, and has numerous educational and social programs for children and youth, men, women, families, and seniors. Examples include weekly adult education classes, youth events, Bar/Bat Mitzvah classes, guest lectures, Shabbat dinners, and holiday programming. A mikveh is located on-site. The Vancouver chapter of NCSY operates out of the synagogue. Congregation Schara Tzedeck is affiliated with the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America.


== History ==
The congregation was founded in 1907 as ""Benei Yehuda"", which can be translated as Children (Sons) of Judah. The first synagogue building was erected at Pender Street and Heatley Avenue in 1911. The congregation was legally incorporated on June 14, 1917 under a newly chosen name, ""Schara Tzedeck"", which means Gates of Righteousness. A new larger building was completed in September 1947, located in the South Cambie neighbourhood adjacent to the Shaughnessy neighborhood. The new synagogue was officially opened on January 25, 1948. In 1963, an expansion was constructed on property to the immediate north to accommodate offices, classrooms, a large auditorium, and other facilities. Past rabbis include Rabbi Bernard Goldenberg, Rabbi Marvin Heir, Rabbi Mordechai Feuerstein, and Rabbi Avi Baumol. The Institute for Stained Glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at Schara Tzedeck Synagogue.


== Present ==
The synagogue has seen growth in membership over the last several years. Its youth program, including NCSY chapter, was reinvigorated in 2001 due to the efforts of Rabbi Avi Berman and has continued to see strong attendance and growth. In 2007, to commemorate the synagogue's centennial, a Century Campaign raised funds for a youth programming fund and renovations of the lower level. The campaign culminated in the Century Celebration gala event held in the spring of 2007. The renovation was completed in the fall of 2011. The new facilities include modern state-of-the-art kitchens, a completely renovated social hall dedicated as the Silber Auditorium, an expansion of the Wosk Auditorium, and renovation of the Beit Midrash. The Beit Midrash was rededicated as the Jack and Sadie Diamond Z""L Beit Midrash and the Yosef Wosk Library.

254,Park Theatre (Vancouver),"The Park Theatre is a neighbourhood movie house on Cambie Street in Vancouver, British Columbia. Opened in 1941, it has passed through several owners, including Odeon Theatres, Famous Players and Alliance Atlantis Cinemas, and in 2005 was renovated and became part of the Festival Cinemas chain. It was acquired by Cineplex Entertainment in 2013 after the Festival chain ceased operations.


== History ==
The Park was built in 1940 by the architectural firm Kaplan & Sprachman, who designed over 300 cinemas between the 1920s and 1960s, including the Vogue Theatre in Vancouver and the Uptown in Toronto. The Park opened on August 4, 1941 and was originally run by Odeon Theatres.In 1984, Odeon Theatres became Cineplex Odeon Corporation, and in 1990 Cineplex Odeon decided not to renew the Park's lease. The theatre was taken over by Leonard Schein's Festival Cinemas, which at various times also has run the Ridge, the Plaza, the Varsity, the Starlight, the Vancouver East and Fifth Avenue Cinemas.Alliance Atlantis bought Schein's company in 1998, and he remained in management there until 2001, when he decided to retire from the movie-theatre business. The Park was run by a partnership of Alliance and Famous Players for a few years, but they decided not to renew its lease in 2005.  Schein, who was by then involving himself in projects such as the Canadian Cancer Society, Friends of Larry Campbell and Doctors Without Borders, hadn't been planning to get back into the movie business. However, phone calls from the building's landlord and local business owners and residents convinced him to lease the theatre and reopen it.


== Renovations ==
Schein spent over $300,000 renovating the Park Theatre. Famous Players had taken everything from the building except a toilet and sink, and since Schein was left with a shell, and had to compete with other theatres, he decided to make the cinema as inviting as possible. Vancouver architect Elizabeth MacKenzie redesigned the interior of the building, and Brad Busby coordinated the construction work, which was done by sub-contractors. New seats were added (down to 504 from 640), with seat rows staggered to allow everyone to have a good view of the new 18-by- 36-foot screen. A Dolby Digital sound system was installed, as were new flooring and lights. The exterior has mostly been kept the same to preserve the historical element of the cinema.

The building was designed by architect Archibald Campbell Hope to serve as a post office. Reportedly, the design was derived from a misdirected set of plans that were meant for another city in the Prairies, which got the smaller building meant to have been constructed here. In the 1970s the building was briefly occupied by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, before being transformed into a community arts venue in the following decade.

256,Madrona School,"Madrona School Society is a not-for-profit independent school located in Vancouver, British Columbia, with a focus on gifted education. Subjects are taught in small groups based on students' ability levels. On average, the student-teacher ratio is between 6:1 and 14:1. Currently, the school offers Kindergarten through Grade 9.


== History ==
Madrona was established in 1993 in the Arbutus Walk area of Vancouver's Kitsilano neighbourhood. In 2002, it moved to the Fairview neighbourhood. It moved a second time in 2008, back to Arbutus Walk. In September 2012, Madrona opened its Primary Annex (Kindergarten to Grade 3) at 2678 West Broadway, a location shared with Pear Tree Education. Madrona left 2678 West Broadway in June 2016. It divided its students between two campuses, Madrona West, located at 2040/2050 West 10th (Kindergarten to Grade 5), and Madrona Downtown, located at 530 Hornby Street (Grades 6 to 10). Madrona Downtown later closed, and Madrona West has been expanded into neighboring 2070 West 10th.


== Governance ==
The Madrona School Society Board of Directors has the authority and responsibility to supervise the management of the affairs of the Society to ensure its continued well-being. The Board oversees the strategy, the budget and financial controls, and sets the overarching policies for the operation and control of the school.


== Madrona West Campus ==
The Madrona West campus is located in Kitsilano, at 2040/2050/2070 West 10th Avenue. This campus houses Kindergarten to Grade 9 (Formerly K-5 before Downtown Campus closed.). A recent 2019 renovation included connecting 2040 and 2050, interior work, and a brand new Administration building, in 2070 (purchased in renovation).


== Madrona Downtown Campus ==
Madrona's previous sister campus location was downtown, at 530 Hornby Street. The Madrona Downtown campus housed Grades 6 to 10. It was sold around 2016, but there are no online records.


== Approach to Learning ==
Madrona's uniquely low ratio of child per educator allows staff to really get to know the students and their families. Madrona puts a strong emphasis on feelings of safety and security so that students feel they are heard and understood. Students are grouped based on their readiness, interest, learning style, and social-emotional skills. This means children can work at varying grade levels in different subjects. Some may accelerate in some areas while needing extra help in others. Teaching methods and subject matter are diverse to suit the unique interests of the student body. Yoga, computer programming, photography, math, music, textiles, and media literacy might all be part of a child's education in a given week. Madrona uses technology to enhance children's learning experiences. Students are provided with tablets for research and writing, and teachers integrate Smart Boards in classroom instruction. As a result, children become technologically savvy learners, come to see digital devices as tools rather than toys, and learn how to use online spaces safely and effectively. Madrona seeks to foster a child-centered learning environment. Students are encouraged to follow their interests and grow into a sense of responsibility and active participation in their education. Madrona focuses on building student autonomy in learning.


== Curriculum ==
Madrona is a Group 2 independent school.  It delivers the BC curriculum focusing on the new curriculum in particular. ""Essential learning, literacy and numeracy foundations, and core competencies are the base of [the] new curriculum. All three contribute to deeper learning."" In addition to the regular curriculum, students study current events, art, music, and drama, and take part in an interdisciplinary technology program covering subjects such as digital art and photography, computer programming, textiles, outdoor education, robotics, and web application development.


== Sports ==
Madrona is yet to have a BC School Sports certified team, However they are eligible (for some sports) An issue is the lack of a gym, which eliminates the possibility for many sports such as Basketball or Volleyball. Although there is no sports team they have participated in several Track & Field contests in recent years, and have had several talented young athletes learn at Madrona. Madrona students get Physical Education class twice weekly in which they often go to Connaught Park, where they frequently play sports such as US Football and Soccer, Students also play there during there lunch break.

258,15th Field Artillery Regiment (Canada),"15th Field Artillery Regiment, RCA, is a Primary Reserve Royal Canadian Artillery (RCA) regiment based in Vancouver, British Columbia, at the Bessborough Armoury. 15th Field Regiment is part of the 39 Canadian Brigade Group of 3rd Canadian Division.
The regiment was created in 1920 as one of the recommendations of the Otter Committee.  In the Second World War it manned the coastal defence artillery guns that protected the Port of Vancouver.  After the war the regiment reverted to field artillery.  While the regiment has not deployed overseas, members have participated in Canadian Forces missions overseas and in Canada.
This unit is not the same 15th Field Artillery Regiment (4th Canadian Armoured Division) that served in the Second World War.


== History ==


=== Foundations ===
The end of World War I saw thousands of Canadians returning home from overseas service with the Canadian Expeditionary Force in Europe.  In January 1918 Major General William Otter recommended to the Government of Canada that a perfect situation existed in which to reorganize the active militia.  This suggestion lead to the creation of the Committee of Militia Reorganization in 1919.  As Major General Otter was the president of this committee it was commonly known as the Otter Committee.On 16 December 1919, at the request of the Otter Committee, a group of 11 artillery officers, recently returned from Europe, met to discuss the creation of a militia artillery regiment in Vancouver. The results of this meeting were worked into the recommendations of the Otter Committee and on 2 February 1920 the Government of Canada authorized the creation of the 15th Brigade, Canadian Field Artillery.The 15th Brigade was composed of the 31st, 68th, and 85th Batteries of field artillery as well as the Headquarters and an Ammunition Column.  The 5th Siege Battery was attached to them for administration purposes.  Lieutenant F.T. Coghlan, DSO, a veteran of World War I, was the first commanding officer of the brigade.At their formation the field artillery batteries were equipped with the Ordnance QF 18 pounder while the 5th Siege Battery was equipped with BL 60 pounder guns.The first home of the brigade was the Vancouver Horse Show Building located on Georgia Street at Alberni Street near Stanley Park. The building was inadequate for the needs of an artillery unit with the exception that it had good facilities for the horses that drew the guns. In March 1934 the 15th Brigade received a new home, the Bessborough Armoury, a modern facility that they shared with the British Columbia Hussars.  The next year the militia artillery across Canada was reorganized and the brigade's name was changed to 15th Field Brigade, Royal Canadian Artillery.When the brigade was created they were supplied with guns by the Canadian Army but not with horses to move them. For their first exercises the gunners had to borrow horses to pull their guns. In June 1928 in order to save money and increase their range, the 5th Battery of the 15th Brigade became one of the first Canadian militia artillery units to experiment with towing guns using trucks. The exercise of 9 June, commanded by Major J.G. Chutter, had the four 60-pounders of the 5th Battery towed by four International trucks. Major Chutter's report at the end of the exercise showed that use of trucks was much less expensive than using horses and that they were able to accomplish three times the training.Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the brigade's training during the year leads towards a summer training camp.  The camps were held in different locations, such as Hastings Park in Vancouver and Sarcee Camp in Alberta.


=== World War II ===
In the mid-1930s the Government of Canada began to take a serious look at the defence of the west coast of Canada. The Empire of Japan had a growing influence over the Pacific and the idea of a war between Canada's allies, the United Kingdom and the United States, with Japan seemed a likely scenario. In 1936 Major B.C.D. Treatt of the Coast Artillery School in England was asked to make recommendations for the defence of the west coast of British Columbia from an attack by sea. In his report Major Treatt made many recommendations including the creation of four new coastal artillery forts to guard the Port of Vancouver. The forts were located in such a way as to stop any ship or submarine from passing into Burrard Inlet. There was also a fort in the Strait of Georgia to prevent ships from approaching Vancouver from the north.  After the war began another fort was built to assist in the inspection of ships entering the Fraser River at Steveston.In 1937 Parliament approved the construction of the forts but had not decided who would man the guns in the event of war.  In World War I members of the Naval Reserve and reservists from Cobourg, Ontario, had manned the coastal defence batteries in Vancouver. In spring 1938 it was decided that members of the Canadian Militia would man them and the 15th Brigade was assigned as coast defence artillery, becoming the 15th Coast Brigade, RCA. A year later in May 1939 the 68th Battery and the 5th Battery were detached to become the 1st Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RCA, to protect Vancouver from attacks from the air. Both the coast defence and anti-aircraft guns were supported by the 1st Searchlight Regiment, RCA, formerly the British Columbia Hussars. They were tasked with operating the ten 800-million-candlepower searchlights, for the coast artillery batteries to target ships at night, as well as manning searchlights for the anti-aircraft guns.

The 15th Coast Brigade was mobilized on 25 August 1939 before war was declared on Nazi Germany. None of the forts were complete when the soldiers arrived for duty so they had to help finish the construction. The batteries of the 15th Coast Brigade were sent to the following forts:
Ferguson Point 31st Battery
Narrows North 31st Battery
Point Atkinson 31st Battery
Point Grey 58th Battery
Steveston 58th Battery
York Island 85th Heavy BatteryApart from their primary role of repelling attacking enemy submarines and ships, most of the forts were also responsible for assisting with the examination of ships approaching Vancouver. Examination areas were set up where ships requesting entrance to the harbour had to stop and submit to an inspection by the Royal Canadian Navy. If a ship failed to stop for inspection the Navy would signal the artillery batteries to fire a round in front of the offending vessel and if necessary sink it. If a stopping round was fired at a ship, the ship's owner was required to pay for the round at a cost of $42.50.In the summer of 1942, the Japanese attacked the Aleutian Islands and various locations along the west coast of the United States.  On 20 June the only attack of the war on Canadian soil took place at Estevan Point.  This combined with the loss of thousands of Canadians at the Battle of Hong Kong seemed to justify the creation of the Pacific coastal forts in the minds of Canadians.After the Battle of Midway the Japanese Navy lost much of its offensive power and was no longer considered a significant threat to the west coast of Canada. This combined with the need for manpower in Europe, after the invasions of Sicily and Normandy, lead to the decision to shut down Vancouver's coast defence forts.  On 1 September 1944 all the forts, with the exception of the York Island fort, were reduced to maintenance manning and the gunners of the 15th Coast Artillery were reassigned to other duties. A team of 20 soldiers conscripted under the National Resources Mobilization Act were left to maintain the forts. By October 1945, two months after the Japanese surrender, all but one of the forts were deactivated.


=== 1945 to present ===
After the war the regiment returned to reserve service and remained coastal artillery, training with the guns at the Point Grey Fort.  In 1948 they reverted to field artillery with the new name of 15th Field Regiment, RCA. A new regiment, the 102nd Coast Regiment, was formed and trained on the coastal guns on Vancouver Island until they were absorbed into the 43rd Medium Anti-Aircraft Regiment in 1954. The 43rd Medium Anti-Aircraft Regiment was created in 1946 from the 1st Anti-Aircraft Regiment and was absorbed back into the 15th Field Regiment, RCA, in 1959.While the regiment has not deployed overseas, individual members have deployed on operations in Germany, Egypt, Cyprus, the Former Republic of Yugoslavia (Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia), Haiti, Sudan, and Afghanistan. Members also participated in Operation Podium, the Canadian Forces mission to assist with security for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia.The regiment currently has three sub-units: 

68th Field Battery, which is the current firing battery and retains the history of 68th Battery, Canadian Field Artillery, which fought in Northern Russia at the close of World War I;
31st Field Battery, which is the current headquarters and services battery; and
The band (mentioned in a preceding section).

263,Hotel at the Waldorf,"The Waldorf Astoria New York is a luxury hotel in Midtown Manhattan in New York City. The structure, at 301 Park Avenue between 49th and 50th streets, is a 47-story 625 ft (191 m) Art Deco landmark designed by architects Schultze and Weaver, which was completed in 1931. The building was the world's tallest hotel from 1931 until 1963, when it was surpassed by Moscow's Hotel Ukraina by 23 feet (7.0 m). An icon of glamour and luxury, the current Waldorf Astoria is one of the world's most prestigious and best-known hotels.  Waldorf Astoria Hotels and Resorts is a division of Hilton Hotels, and a portfolio of high-end properties around the world now operate under the name, including in New York City. Both the exterior and the interior of the Waldorf Astoria are designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission as official landmarks.
The original Waldorf–Astoria was built in two stages, as the Waldorf Hotel and the Astoria Hotel, which accounts for its dual name. That original site was situated on Astor family properties along Fifth Avenue, opened in 1893, and designed by Henry J. Hardenbergh. It was demolished in 1929 to make way for the construction of the Empire State Building. 
Particularly after its relocation, the Waldorf Astoria gained international renown for its lavish dinner parties and galas, often at the center of political and business conferences and fundraising schemes involving the rich and famous. Particularly after World War II it played a significant role in world politics and the Cold War, culminating in the controversial World Peace Conference of March 1949 at the hotel, in which Stalinism was widely denounced. Conrad Hilton acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949, and the Hilton Hotels Corporation finally bought the hotel outright in 1972. It underwent a $150 million renovation by Lee Jablin in the 1980s and early 1990s, and in October 2014 it was announced that the Anbang Insurance Group of China had purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US$1.95 billion, making it the most expensive hotel ever sold. On July 1, 2016, Anbang announced that it would convert some of the Waldorf's hotel rooms into condominiums, closing the hotel for a three-year renovation on March 1, 2017. The renovated structure will house 375 hotel rooms and 375 brand-new residential condos.The Waldorf Astoria and Towers has a total of 1,413 hotel rooms as of 2014. In 2009, when it had 1,416 rooms, the main hotel had 1,235 single and double rooms and 208 mini suites, while the Waldorf Towers, from the 28th floor up to the 42nd, had 181 rooms, of which 115 were suites, with one to four bedrooms. Several of the luxury suites are named after celebrities who lived or stayed in them such as the Cole Porter Suite, the Royal Suite, named after the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, the MacArthur Suite and the Churchill Suite. The most expensive room, the Presidential Suite, is designed with Georgian-style furniture to emulate that of the White House. It was the residence of Herbert Hoover from his retirement for over 30 years, and Frank Sinatra kept a suite at the Waldorf from 1979 until 1988. The hotel has three main restaurants: Peacock Alley, The Bull and Bear Steak House, and La Chine—a new Chinese restaurant that replaced Oscar's Brasserie in late 2015. Sir Harry's Bar, also located in the hotel, is named after British explorer Sir Harry Johnston.


== Name ==
The name of the hotel is ultimately derived from the town of Walldorf, which lies in the north of the German state of  Baden-Württemberg, south of Mannheim and Heidelberg. Walldorf is the ancestral home of the prominent German-American Astor family who originated there. In German, ""Waldorf"" (with one l, like the hotel) means ""Whale Village"" (Wal = whale, Dorf = village), and ""Walldorf"" (with two l's, like the town) means ""Rampart Village"" (Wall = rampart). The name of the town, however, formed through an elision: ""Walddorf"" (with two d's), meaning ""Forest Village"" (Wald = forest), became ""Walldorf"". An oak tree in the coat of arms of the town refers to this etymology.
The hotel was originally known as the Waldorf-Astoria with a single hyphen, as recalled by a popular expression and song, ""Meet Me at the Hyphen"". The sign was changed to a double hyphen, looking similar to an equals sign, by Conrad Hilton when he purchased the hotel in 1949. The double hyphen visually represents ""Peacock Alley"", the hallway between the two hotels that once stood where the Empire State building now stands today. The use of the double hyphen was discontinued by parent company Hilton in 2009, shortly after the introduction of the Waldorf Astoria Hotels and Resorts chain. The hotel has since been known as the Waldorf Astoria New York, without any hyphen, though this is sometimes shortened to the Waldorf Astoria.


== History ==


=== Original buildings ===


==== Creation ====
The original hotel started as two hotels on Fifth Avenue built by feuding relatives. The first hotel, the 13-story, 450-room Waldorf Hotel, designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh in the German Renaissance style, was opened on March 13, 1893, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street, on the site where millionaire developer William Waldorf Astor had his mansion. The original hotel stood 225 feet (69 m) high, with a frontage of about 100 feet (30 m) on Fifth Avenue, with an area of 69,475 square feet (6,454.4 m2). The original hotel was described as having a ""lofty stone and brick exterior"", which was ""animated by an effusion of balconies, alcoves, arcades, and loggias beneath a tile roof bedecked with gables and turrets"". William Astor, motivated in part by a dispute with his aunt Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor, had built the Waldorf Hotel next door to her house, on the site of his father's mansion. The hotel was built to the specifications of founding proprietor George Boldt, who owned and operated the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, a fashionable hotel on Broad Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with his wife Louise. Boldt was described as ""Mild mannered, undignified, unassuming"", resembling ""a typical German professor with his close-cropped beard which he kept fastidiously trimmed... and his pince-nez glasses on a black silk cord"". Boldt continued to own the Bellevue even after his relationship with the Astors blossomed.
At first, the Waldorf appeared destined for failure. It was originally a laughing stock with its high number of bathrooms and was known briefly as ""Boldt's Folly"" or ""Astor's Folly"", with the general perception of the palatial hotel being that it had no place in New York City. Wealthy New Yorkers were angry because they viewed the construction of the hotel as the ruination of a good neighborhood. Business travelers found it too expensive and too far uptown for their needs. In the face of all of this, George Boldt decided that the hotel would host a benefit concert for St. Mary's Hospital for Children on its opening day. The hospital was the favorite charity of those on the Social Register. The ballroom filled with many of New York's First Families, who had paid five dollars for the concert and dinner at the Waldorf. It soon became a major success, earning $4.5 million in its first year, exorbitant for that period.

William Astor's construction of a hotel next to his aunt's house worsened his feud with her, but with Boldt's assistance, Waldorf's cousin, John Jacob Astor IV, persuaded his mother to move uptown. On November 1, 1897, John Jacob Astor IV opened the 17-story Astoria Hotel on an adjacent site, and leased it to Boldt. The hotels were initially built as two separate structures, but Boldt planned the Astoria so it could be connected to the Waldorf by an alley. Peacock Alley was constructed to connect the two buildings, and the hotel subsequently became known as the ""Waldorf-Astoria"", the largest hotel in the world at the time.


==== Heyday ====
With a telephone in every room and first-class room service, the hotel was designed specifically to cater to the needs of socially prominent ""wealthy upper crust"" of New York and distinguished foreign visitors to the city. The hotel became, according to author Sean Dennis Cashman, ""a successful symbol of the opulence and achievement of the Astor family"". It was the first hotel to offer complete electricity and private bathrooms. Founding proprietor Boldt, whose motto was ""the guest is always right"", became wealthy and prominent internationally, if not so much a popular celebrity as his famous employee, Oscar Tschirky, known as ""Oscar of the Waldorf"", maître d'hôtel from the hotel's inauguration in 1893 until his retirement in 1943. Tschirky had arrived in the United States from Switzerland 10 years prior to applying for the position at the new Waldorf, and over the years grew to possess a great knowledge of cuisine. He authored The Cookbook by Oscar of the Waldorf (1896), a 900-page book featuring all of the popular recipes of the day, including his own, for which he garnered great acclaim, such as Waldorf salad, eggs Benedict, and Thousand Island dressing, which remain popular worldwide today. James Remington McCarthy wrote in his book Peacock Alley that Oscar gained renown among the general public as an artist who ""composed sonatas in soups, symphonies in salads, minuets in sauces, lyrics in entrees"". In 1902, Tschirky published Serving a Course Dinner by Oscar of the Waldorf-Astoria, a booklet that explains the intricacies of being a caterer to the American and international elite. Tschirky had an excellent memory and an encyclopedic memory of the culinary preferences of many of the guests, which further added to his popularity. In 1937, for instance, he recalled the opening night and notable people present at the old Waldorf, a guest at the old building known to the public as Buffalo Bill, and spoke at length about the planning for the Panama Canal that took place at the Waldorf-Astoria.The Waldorf gained significant renown internationally for its fundraising dinners and balls, regularly attracting notables of the day such as Andrew Carnegie, who became a fixture. Banquets were often held in the ballroom for esteemed figures and international royalty. The Waldorf Astoria was influential in advancing the status of women, who were admitted singly without escorts. George Boldt's wife, Louise Kehrer Boldt, was influential in evolving the idea of the grand urban hotel as a social center, particularly in making it appealing to women as a venue for social events. On February 11, 1899, Oscar hosted a lavish dinner reception that the New York Herald Tribune cited as the city's costliest dinner at the time. Some $250 were spent per guest, with bluepoint oysters, green turtle soup, lobster, ruddy duck, and blue raspberries. One article that year claimed that at any one time, the hotel had $7 million worth of valuables locked in the safe, testament to the wealth of its guests. In 1902, a lavish dinner was organized for Prince Henry of Prussia, and in 1909, banquets attended by hundreds were organized for Arctic explorer Frederick Cook in September and Elbert Henry Gary, a founder of US Steel, the following month.The United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic was opened at the hotel on April 19, 1912, and continued there for some time in the Myrtle Room, before moving on to Washington, D.C. John Jacob Astor IV was one of the people who perished on its ill-fated journey. Seven senators were present on the subcommittee, including William Alden Smith (Republican, Michigan) as chair, Jonathan Bourne (R, Oregon), Theodore E. Burton (R, Ohio), Duncan U. Fletcher (Democrat, Florida), Francis G. Newlands (D, Nevada), George Clement Perkins (R, California), and Furnifold McLendel Simmons (D, North Carolina). The composition of the subcommittee was carefully chosen to represent the conservative, moderate, and liberal wings of the two parties.

In 1919, restaurateur Louis Sherry announced an ""alliance"" with the Waldorf-Astoria that involved both his candies and catering services. Although it was not disclosed at that time, at some point, ownership of Louis Sherry Inc. was significantly vested in ""Boomer-duPont interests"", a reference to Lucius M. Boomer, then chairman of the Waldorf-Astoria, and T. Coleman du Pont. Upon his death that year, William Waldorf Astor was reputed to have been worth £200 million, which he left in trust for his two sons Waldorf and John Jacob. His half share of the Waldorf Astoria and the Astor Hotel at the time were reported to have been worth £10 million. On the evening of November 15, 1926, the National Broadcasting Company broadcast its inaugural program from the grand ballroom of the old Waldorf-Astoria. Among the entertainers heard by radio listeners was Will Rogers. The network became the Red Network on January 1, 1927, when NBC launched its second network, designated the Blue Network. An antitrust suit forced the sale of the Blue Network in 1942; it became the American Broadcasting Company.The hotel faced stiff competition from the early 20th century, with a range of new hotels springing up in New York City such the Hotel Astor (1904), the St. Regis (1904), the Knickerbocker (1906), and the Savoy-Plaza Hotel (1927). By the 1920s, the hotel was becoming dated, and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north than 34th Street. The Astor family finally sold the hotel to the developers of the Empire State Building and closed the hotel on May 3, 1929. It was demolished soon after.

==== Early years and international politics ====
The idea of a new Waldorf-Astoria hotel was based on the concept that a large, opulent hotel should be available in New York for distinguished visitors. Financial backing was not difficult to get in the summer of 1929, as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious about whether this was the right time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, which had operated a power plant for Grand Central Terminal on the site. New York Central had promised $10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate.The new building opened on Park Avenue, between East 49th and East 50th streets, on October 1, 1931. It was the tallest and largest hotel in the world at the time, covering the entire block. The slender central tower became known as the Waldorf Towers, with its own private entrance on 50th Street, and consisted of 100 suites, about one-third of which were leased as private residences. President Herbert Hoover said on the radio, broadcast from the White House: ""The opening of the new Waldorf Astoria is an event in the advancement of hotels, even in New York City. It carries great tradition in national hospitality...marks the measure of nation's growth in power, in comfort and in artistry...an exhibition of courage and confidence to the whole nation"". About 2,000 people were in the ballroom listening to this speech, but by the end of the business day, the 2,200-room hotel had only 500 occupancies.  The Waldorf-Astoria did not begin operating at a profit until 1939. Lucius Boomer continued to manage the hotel in the 1930s and 1940s, a commanding figure to whom Tony Rey referred as ""the greatest hotelman of his era"". Boomer was elected chairman of the board of the Waldorf-Astoria Corporation on February 20, 1945, a position he held until his death in July 1947.Like the original hotel, from its inception, the Waldorf Astoria gained worldwide renown for its glamorous dinner parties and galas, often at the center of political and business conferences and fundraising schemes. Author Ward Morehouse III has referred to the Waldorf Astoria as ""comparable to great national institutions"" and a ""living symbol deep within our collective consciousness"". It had the ""greatest banquet department in the world"" at the time according to restaurateur Tom Margittai, with the center of activity being the Grand Ballroom. On August 3, 1932, some 200 people representing the ""cream of New York's literary world"" attended the Waldorf Astoria to honor Pearl S. Buck, the author of The Good Earth, which was the best-selling novel in the United States in 1931 and 1932. One dinner alone, a relatively ""small dinner"" attended by some 50 people in June 1946, raised over $250,000. During the 1930s and 1940s the hotel's guests were also entertained at the elegant ""Starlight Roof"" nightclub by the Waldorf-Astoria Orchestra and such noted musicians as: Xavier Cugat, Eddie Duchin, Lester Lanin and Glenn Miller.The hotel played a considerable role in the emerging Cold War and international relations during the postwar years, staging numerous events and conferences. On March 15, 1946, Winston Churchill attended a welcoming dinner at the hotel given by Governor Thomas E. Dewey, 10 days after making his famous Iron Curtain speech, and from November 4 to December 12, 1946, the Big Four Conference was held in Jørgine Boomer's apartment on the 37th floor of the Towers between the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to discuss the future of Eastern Europe. On November 24, 1947, 48 prominent figures of the Hollywood film industry, including various film executives such as Louis B. Mayer of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures, Spyros Skouras of 20th Century Fox, Albert Warner of Warner Bros., and Eric Johnston, the head of the Association of Motion Picture Producers, met at the Waldorf Astoria and discussed what would become the Waldorf Statement, banning people with Communist beliefs or tendencies from the Hollywood film industry. The statement was a response to the contempt of Congress charges against the so-called ""Hollywood Ten"".
On June 21, 1948, a press conference at the hotel introduced the LP record. From March 27 to 29, 1949, the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace, also known as the Waldorf World Peace Conference, was held at the hotel to discuss the emerging Cold War and the growing divide between the US and the Soviet Union. The conference came at time when deep anti-Communist sentiment and suspicion of the Soviet Union existed in the United States, following the Berlin Blockade and the Czechoslovak coup d'état the previous year. The event was organized by the struggling American Communist Party. It was sponsored by many individuals who were not Stalinists, such as Leonard Bernstein, Marlon Brando, Albert Einstein, and Aaron Copland. They joined with the intention of promoting peace, and the Party found them useful. The conference was attended by the likes of Soviet Foreign Minister Andrey Vyshinsky, composer and pianist Dmitri Shostakovich, and writer Alexsander Fadeyev. Tension mounted during the controversial event, and culminated when Shostakovich, in front of a crowd of some 800 people, launched a scathing attack on western civilization, announcing, ""a small clique of hatemongers was preparing world public opinion for the transition from cold war to outright aggression"". The event was picketed in a counterattack by anti-Stalinists running under the banner of America for Intellectual Freedom, and prominent individuals such as Irving Howe, Dwight Macdonald, Mary McCarthy, Robert Lowell, and Norman Mailer angrily denounced Stalinism at the hotel. In 1954, Israeli statesman and archaeologist Yigael Yadin met secretly with the Syriac Orthodox Archbishop Mar Samuel in the basement of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel to negotiate the purchase of four Dead Sea Scrolls for Israel. The scrolls were kept in a vault at the Waldorf-Astoria branch of New York's Chemical Bank. At the request of the Israeli government, respected biblical scholar Dr. Harry Orlinsky examined the scrolls and verified their authenticity; Yadin paid $250,000 for all four. Restaurateur George Lang began working at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in 1955, and on December 13, 1955, he helped organize the American Theatre Wing's First Night Ball to celebrate Helen Hayes's 50th year in show business. He did much to organize dinners at the Waldorf to assist Hungarian issues and relief. On one occasion, an event was attended by  Edward G. Robinson and pianist Doklady and some $60,000 were raised.


==== April in Paris Ball ====

The April in Paris Ball was an annual gala event whose mission was to improve Franco–American relations, to share cultures, and to help provide assistance to US and French charities, aside from commemorating the 2000th anniversary of the founding of Paris. It was established by Claude Philippe, the hotel banquet manager, in 1952. While the hotel's management handled invitations and publicity, other details were coordinated by socialites. Elsa Maxwell was given the primary responsibility in organizing it. It was initially held annually in April, but according to Ann Vaccaro, former executive director of the ball, it was changed to October because ""Mr. Philippe decided that because there are so many balls in the spring, he would make it in October"". After being changed to October, it often marked the start of the US fall social season. It was staged in the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf for eight years before moving to the Hotel Astor in 1960, the Seventh Regiment Armory in 1961, and other venues.The ball was designed to cater for ""very, very high-class people"" according to Vaccaro. Raffle tickets cost US$100 per person and offered opulent prizes such as a US$5000 bracelet and other jewels, expensive furs, perfumes, and even cars. In the 1960 event, prizes given included a Ford Thunderbird car, a chinchilla coat, a Renault Dauphine, a TV Hi-Fi system, an electric typewriter, 25 cases of expensive French wines, original paintings and porcelains, jewels, clocks, evening bags, and a pedigreed poodle; guests were given gift boxes containing gold key rings and jewelry, champagne and brandy, Maxim ashtrays, pipes, silver bottle openers, hats and scarves, and flowers. Every guest was said to have gone home with at least one gift in return. In the 1979 event, some US$106,000 worth of prizes was given out. Over its history, the ball, which was exempt from taxes, earned millions of dollars, which went primarily to over 20 American charities such as the American Cancer Society, with 15 to 20% going towards French charities. A staff of three people was paid full-time throughout the year to organize it. Of the expenses of the ball, founder Philippe stated, ""We charge the most, give the most, and make the most – it's a success formula"". Bernard F. Gimbel served as chief treasurer.

The Paris Ball became a notable event in the annual calendar during the 1950s, with one early show featuring a ""three-hour spectacular of five tableaux, directed by Stuart Chaney"", [depicting] a 12th-century scene of troubadours at the court of Eleanor of Aquitane, Henry VIII's meeting at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, Louis XIV at Versailles, and a fashion show of 40 creations by Dior, Fath, Balmain, Desses, and Givenchy"". French stars Juliette Gréco, Jean Sablon, Beatrice Lillie, John Loder and many others were flown over for the ball. The 1957 event was attended by some 1300 guests, including the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Senator John F. Kennedy, his wife, Jackie, and Marilyn Monroe, who paid $100 each and donated $130,000 to charities. The following year, the ballroom was decorated with 30 feet (9.1 m) high chestnut trees, earning US$170,000 for charities.  The final ball to be hosted in the hotel was held on April 10, 1959, with the main theme being the Parisian circus of the 18th century. Genuine circus costumes from the period were flown over from France, and the ball was attended by Marlene Dietrich, who performed two Maurice Chevalier songs, wearing a top hat, trousers, a waistcoat, and white gloves.


=== Later history ===
On May 6, 1963, Time celebrated its 40th anniversary at the hotel. The event was attended by some 1500 celebrities, including General Douglas MacArthur, Jean Monnet, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., Bob Hope, Joe Louis, David O. Selznick, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Edward Kennedy, Henry Ford II, and many others.  In 1968, British rock band The Who checked into the hotel, where they encountered difficulties with the staff of the Waldorf Astoria. Due to the band's reputation for trashing their hotel rooms and rowdy behavior, the Waldorf demanded that they pay cash up front. However, following their gig, the band members were refused access to their hotel rooms, where their luggage was being kept. Tony Fletcher, in his biography on Keith Moon, claims that Moon challenged the staff and blew the door to their room off the hinges with his cherry bombs and retrieved their luggage, which prompted The Who to be shown the door and banned from the hotel for life. However, clearly the ban was later revoked as they performed at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction at the Waldorf on January 17, 1990.

Soon after the opening of the hotel in 1931, hotelier Conrad Hilton, almost bankrupt at the time, reportedly cut out a photograph of the hotel from a magazine and wrote across it, ""The Greatest of Them All"". He acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949. The Hilton Hotels Corporation finally bought the hotel outright in 1972.In the 1970s, the Waldorf Astoria continued to play an important role in international politics, particularly between the US and the Middle East. In November 1974, a ""20-car motorcade, with eight shotgun-toting police marksmen aboard in bullet-proof vests"" brought Palestinian Fatah party leader Farouk Kaddoumi to the Waldorf from John F. Kennedy International Airport. The Waldorf was on red alert, and German Shepherd sniffer dogs were brought in prior to his arrival to look for possible bombs. Fifteen suites of the hotel were reserved for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) delegation. The following month, President Ford met with Nelson Rockefeller after he was voted Vice President, and a 90-minute press conference was held in a suite in the hotel. In November 1975, the US government insisted that PLO leader Yasser Arafat stay at the Waldorf during his visit to America, against the wishes of the hotel staff; security was stepped up severely. On August 12, 1981, IBM unveiled its Personal Computer in a press conference at the Waldorf Astoria, and in 1985, the NBA held its first-ever draft lottery between nonplayoff teams at the Starlight Room. The lottery was for the 1985 NBA Draft in which Patrick Ewing was the consensus number-one pick.Lee Jablin, of Harman Jablin Architects, fully renovated and upgraded the historical property to its original grandeur during the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s in a $150 million renovation.  The hotel was named an official New York City Landmark in 1993. On May 27, 2001, the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America had a grand banquet at the hotel to celebrate the 1700th anniversary of Armenia's conversion to Christianity, with Ambassador Edward Djerejian as guest speaker. On May 7, 2004, a press conference was held by MGM, discussing Steve Martin's The Pink Panther of the Pink Panther series. The 5th Annual DGA Honors Gala was held at the Waldorf on September 29.In 2006, Hilton launched Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts, a brand named for the hotel. Branches of the Waldorf Astoria are now located in Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, and Louisiana in the United States, and abroad in France, Israel, Italy, and Saudi Arabia. In 2006, Hilton was reported to be considering opening a new Waldorf Astoria hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. In 2008, the Waldorf Astoria opened the Guerlain and Spa Chakra, Inc. spa at the hotel, as part of the Waldorf Astoria Collection, which offers a ""body massage and facial using Guerlain's age-defying Orchidee Imperiale skincare"".The Waldorf Astoria New York is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. ""The Towers of the Waldorf Astoria"" continues to operate as a boutique ""hotel within a hotel"". In October 2014,  the Anbang Insurance Group, based in China, was announced to have purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US$1.95 billion, making it the most expensive hotel ever sold.On July 1, 2016, Anbang announced plans to refurbish the hotel and turn some rooms into condominiums. Under the plan, some of the hotel's rooms will be turned into apartments, with the remainder of the rooms remaining hotel suites. As part of the refurbishment process, the hotel closed on March 1, 2017. The hotel's restaurants, including Peacock Alley, The Bull and Bear Steak House, and the recently opened La Chine, closed along with the hotel; they will reopen when the renovation is completed. A week after the hotel closed, on March 7, 2017, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission voted unanimously to list the interiors of the hotel's famous public spaces as New York City landmarks, protecting them from any alteration during the renovations. In November 2019 it was announced that the 375 condos in the Waldorf-Astoria would go on sale starting in early 2020, while the 350 remaining hotel rooms would not reopen until 2021.


== Architecture ==

Travel America stated: ""To linger in the sumptuous salons of the Waldorf-Astoria is to step back in time. Your trip down memory lane is a flashback to the glamor days of the 1930s, when this Art Deco masterpiece was the tallest hotel in the world and the epicenter of elite society. A legendary limestone landmark occupying a whole block of prime real estate in midtown Manhattan, it's still a prestigious address that embodies luxury and power in the richest city on earth.""


=== Exterior ===

The hotel was designed by architects Schultze and Weaver and constructed at 301 Park Avenue, just north of Grand Central Terminal. That area was developed atop the existing railroad tracks leading to the station, as part of the Terminal City complex, wherein buildings like the Waldorf Astoria using ""air rights"" to the space above the tracks. The new building opened on October 1, 1931. The 47-story 190.5 m (625 ft) hotel was the tallest and largest hotel in the world, and remained so for a number of years.
1,585 cubic feet (44.9 m3) of black marble was imported from Belgium, 600 cubic feet (17 m3) of Brech Montalto and 260 cubic feet (7.4 m3) of Alps Green arrived from Italy, and some 300 antique mantles were brought in to furnish it; 200 railroad cars brought some 800,000 cubic feet (23,000 m3) of limestone for the building's facing, 27,100 tons of steel for the skeleton superstructure, and 2.595 million square feet (241,100 m2) of terra cotta and gypsum block. The towers are brick-faced, which led many to believe that the builders ran out of money.Peacock Alley, a 300-ft-long corridor lined with amber marble, connects the two hotel buildings. Gilded, women of the times would enjoy walking along it and admiring themselves in the mirrors. In 1931,  as many as 36,000 people reportedly were walking down it on any given day. The Peacock Alley restaurant of the Waldorf took its name from the alley.


=== Interior ===

Such is the architectural and cultural heritage of the hotel that tours are conducted of the hotel for guests. Frommer's has cited the hotel as an ""icon of luxury"", and highlights the ""wide stately corridors, the vintage Deco door fixtures, the white-gloved bellmen, the luxe shopping arcade"", the ""stunning round mosaic under an immense crystal chandelier"", and the ""free-standing Waldorf clock, covered with bronze relief figures"" in the main lobby. They compare the decor of the rooms to those of an English country house, and describe the corridors as being wide and plush-carpeted, which ""seem to go on forever"".The lobby floor contains the room registration and cashier desks, the Empire Room and Hilton Room, the private Marco Polo Club, the Wedding Salon, Kenneth's Salon, the Peacock Alley lounge and restaurant, and Sir Harry's Bar. From 1992 to 2013, Kenneth, sometimes called the world's first celebrity hairdresser, famed for creating Jacqueline Kennedy's bouffant in 1961, moved his hairdressing and beauty salon to the Waldorf after a 1990 fire destroyed his East 54th Street shop. In the main foyer is a chandelier measuring 10 feet (3.0 m) by 10 feet (3.0 m). The elevator is furnished with paneled pollard oak and Carpathian elm. Special desks in the lobby are allocated to transportation and theatre, where exclusive tickets to many of the city's prominent theatres can be purchased. The lobby is furnished with polished nickel-bronze cornices and rockwood stone. The grand clock, a 4000-lb bronze, was built by the Goldsmith's Company of London originally for the 1893 World Columbia Exposition in Chicago, but was purchased by the Waldorf owners.  Its base is octagonal, with eight commemorative plaques of presidents George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, Andrew Jackson, Benjamin Harrison, and Grover Cleveland, and Queen Victoria and Benjamin Franklin. A shield once belonging to the Waldorf was moved to the Alexis restaurant on W. Franklin Street in 1984. Several boutiques surround the lobby, which contains Cole Porter's Steinway & Sons floral print-decorated grand piano on the Cocktail Terrace, which the hotel had once given him as a gift. Porter was a resident at the hotel for 30 years and composed many of his songs here. The Empire Room is where many of the musical and dance performances were put on, from Count Basie, to Victor Borge, Gordon MacRae, Liza Minnelli, George M. Cohan, and Lena Horne, the first black performer at the hotel.

The third floor contains the Grand Ballroom, the Silver Corridor, the Basildon Room, the Jade Room, and the Astor Gallery. Numerous organizations hold their annual dinners in the grand ballroom of the Waldorf, including St. John's University President's Dinner, the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York's annual gala, during which the Deus Caritas Est Award for philanthropy is presented, and the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. The NASCAR Sprint Cup end-of-season awards banquet was held at the Waldorf-Astoria every year between 1981 and 2008 before moving to the Wynn in Las Vegas. It was held initially in the Starlight Room, but from 1985, it was staged in the Grand Ballroom, except in 2001 and 2002. On May 1, 2004, the Waldorf-Astoria was the venue for the Manhattan Hungarian Network Grand Europe Ball, a historic black-tie charitable affair co-chaired by Archduke Georg of Austria-Hungary which celebrated the enlargement of the European Union. Bob Hope was such a regular performer at the Ballroom that he said, ""I've played so many dinners in the Grand Ballroom, I always make a crack when I get up to speak that I leave my dinner jacket in the lobby so that I don't have to ship it to the Coast all the time"". Of note in the Astor Gallery are 12 allegorical females, painted by Edward Emerson Simmons. Every October, the Paris Ball was held in the Grand Ballroom, before moving to the Americana (now the Sheraton Center). It hosted a memorable New Year's Eve party with Guy Lombardo and the Royal Canadians, and Lombardo used to broadcast live on the radio there from the ""Starlight Roof"". Maurice Chevalier performed at the ballroom in 1965 in his last appearance. The Silver Corridor outside the ballroom bears a resemblance to the Peacock Alley, but is shorter and wider. The fourth floor has the banquet and sales offices, and many of the suites including Barron, Vanderbilt, Windsor, Conrad, Vertès, Louis XVI, and Cole Porter, named after the celebrities who stayed in them. The fourth floor was where the notorious Sunday-night card games were played. Also, it has a re-creation of one of the living rooms of Hoover's Waldorf-Astoria suite in the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum.


==== Rooms and suites ====

The Waldorf Astoria and Towers has a total of 1,413 hotel rooms as of 2014.
In 2009, when it had 1,416 rooms, the main hotel had 1,235 single and double rooms and 208 minisuites, 17 of which were classified as ""Astoria Level"", which are upgraded rooms with deluxe amenities and complimentary access to the Astoria Lounge. The Waldorf Towers, from the 28th floor up to the 42nd, had 181 rooms, of which 115 were suites, with one to four bedrooms. As of the late 1990s, the hotel had a housekeeping staff of nearly 400, with 150 day maids and 24 night maids.
The rooms retain the original Art Deco motifs, although each room is decorated differently. The guests rooms, classified as Deluxe, Superior, and Luxury, feature ""Waldorf Serenity"" beds and have a marble bath or shower with amenities designed by Salvatore Ferragamo. The suites featured king or double beds and start in size at 450 square feet (42 m2). The smallest are the one-bedroom suites, which range from 450 to 600 square feet (42 to 56 m2), then the Signature suites have a separate living room and one or two bedrooms, which range from 750 to 900 square feet (70 to 84 m2), and finally, the suites of The Towers are generally larger and costlier still, and have a twice-daily maid service.
The Tower suites are divided into standard ones, The Towers Luxury Series, which have their own sitting room, the Towers Penthouse Series, the Towers Presidential-Style Suites, and finally the most expensive Presidential Suite on the 35th floor. The Penthouse Series contains three suites, The Penthouse, The Cole Porter Suite, and The Royal Suite, named after the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. They start at 1,800 square feet (170 m2) in size, with two or more bedrooms, and are fitted with a kitchen and dining room which can accommodate for 8–12 guests. The Towers Presidential-Style Suites are divided into the MacArthur Suite and the Churchill Suite, and have their own grand entry foyer. Like the Penthouse Series, they have their own kitchen and dining room. The 2,250 square feet (209 m2) Presidential Suite is designed with Georgian-style furniture to emulate that of the White House. It has three large bedrooms and three bathrooms, and boasts numerous treasures, including the desk of General MacArthur and rocking chair of John F. Kennedy.


==== Other facilities ====
A 2,500 square feet (230 m2) fitness center is on the 5th floor. The $21.5 million Waldorf Astoria Guerlain Spa was inaugurated on September 1, 2008 on the 19th floor. It features 16 treatment rooms and two relaxation lounges. The hotel has its own Business Center, a 1,150 square feet (107 m2) digital facility, where guests can access the Internet and photocopy. In 2004 the hotel launched a line of products in keeping with the Art Deco style of the hotel, reportedly becoming the first individual hotel in the world to have its own merchandise collection.


==== Secret railway track ====
The hotel has its own railway platform, Track 61, that was part of the New York Central Railroad (later Metro-North Railroad), and was connected to the Grand Central Terminal complex. The platform was used by Franklin D. Roosevelt, James Farley, Adlai Stevenson, and Douglas MacArthur, among others. The platform was also used for the exhibition of American Locomotive Company's new diesel locomotive in 1946. In 1948, Filene's and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad also staged a fashion show on the platform. An elevator large enough for Franklin D. Roosevelt's automobile provides access to the platform. There is a pedestrian entrance from E 50th St., just to the left of the Waldorf Towers entrance. However, it is rarely opened to the public.


== Restaurants and cuisine ==

The Waldorf Astoria was the first hotel to offer room service and was the first major hotel in the world to hire women as chefs, beginning in 1931. An extensive menu is available for guests, with special menus for children and for dieters. The executive chef of the Waldorf for many years was John Doherty, following the Austrian Arno Schmidt who held the position for ten years from 1969 to 1979. Restaurateur George Lang was awarded the Hotelman of the Year Award in 1975. As of the early 1990s, the hotel served over three million dishes a year, and got through 27,000 pounds of lobster, 100 pounds of beluga caviar, 380,000 pints of strawberries annually. The hotel has gained significant renown for its lavish feasts. During one grand feast for Francis Cardinal Spellman, over 200 VIP guests, according to Arno Schmidt, devoured some 3,600 pounds of fillet, 600 pounds of fresh halibut, 1,500 pounds of potatoes, and 260 pounds of petit fours, eaten on gold china plates. One 1973 feast by the Explorer's Club devoured hippo meat, a 4-foot (1.2 m) alligator, a baby shark, an amberjack tuna, a boa, wild boar hams, 480 pieces of breaded-fried cod tongues and cheeks, antelope steaks, two boxes of Chinese rabbit, and 20 pounds of rattlesnake.

The hotel has three main restaurants, Peacock Alley, The Bull and Bear Steak House, and Oscar's Brasserie, as well as a secondary restaurant, the Japanese Inagiku. At its peak in the late 1940s, the hotel once had nine restaurants. Peacock Alley, situated in the heart of the lobby, features an Art Deco design with gilded ceilings and includes a main restaurant, a bar and lounge, and three private dining salons. It is known primarily for its fish and seafood dishes. Sunday Brunch is particularly popular with locals and features over 180 gourmet dishes divided into 12 themed displays, with cuisine ranging from lobster and oysters to Belgian waffles, Eggs Benedict, and omelettes to hollandaise sauces. The Bull and Bear Steak House is furnished in richly polished mahogany in the English Regency style, and has a ""den-like"" atmosphere, and is reportedly the only restaurant on the East Coast which serves 28 days prime grade USDA Certified Angus Beef. It has won awards from the National Restaurant Association and Holiday magazine. Between 2007 and 2010, the restaurant was the filming location for Fox Business Happy Hour, presented live between 5 and 6 pm. The Bull and Bear Bar is based on the original Waldorf Astoria Bar, which was a favorite haunt of many of the financial elite of the city from the hotel's inception in 1893, and adventurers such as Diamond Jim Brady, Buffalo Bill Cody and Bat Masterson. Behind the bar are bronze statues of a bull and a bear, which represent the successful men of Wall Street. The Inagiku, meaning the ""rice chrysanthemum"", serves contemporary Japanese cuisine. The restaurant opens for lunch on weekdays and cocktails and dinner in the evenings. Designed by Henry Look of San Francisco, the restaurant has four ""distinctly different"" rooms, including one which represents an old Japanese farmhouse, and the Kinagu Room, resembling a Japanese temple. Guests have the option to reserve private orthodox tatami rooms.

Oscar's Brasserie, overlooking Lexington Avenue in what was once a Savarin restaurant, is designed by Adam Tihany. The restaurant takes its name from Oscar Tschirky (Oscar of the Waldorf) and serves traditional American cuisine, with many dishes based upon his cookbook which have gained world renown, including the Waldorf salad, Eggs Benedict, Thousand Island dressing, and Veal Oscar. The Waldorf salad—a salad made with apples, walnuts, celery, grapes, and mayonnaise or a mayonnaise-based dressing—was first created in 1896 at the Waldorf by Oscar. The original recipe, however did not contain nuts, but they had been added by the time the recipe appeared in The Rector Cook Book in 1928. Tschirky was also noted for his ""Oscar's Sauce"", which became so popular that it was sold at the hotel. Another of the hotel's specialties was red velvet cake, which became one of its most popular desserts.Sir Harry's Bar is one of the principal bars of the hotel, situated just off the main lobby. It is named after British Sir Harry Johnston (1858–1927). In the 1970s the bar was renovated in a ""plush African safari"" design to honor Johnston, a notable explorer of Africa, with ""zebra-striped wall coverings and carpeting, with bent-cane furnishings"". It has since been redecorated back to a more conservative design, with walnut paneling and leather banquettes, and featured a 23 feet (7.0 m) by 8 feet (2.4 m) ebony bar as of the early 1990s. Frank Sinatra frequented Sir Harry's Bar for many years. In 1991, while drinking at Sir Harry's with Jilly Rizzo and Steve Lawrence, he was approached by a fan asking for an autograph. Sinatra responded, ""Don't you see I'm on my own time here? You asshole. What's wrong with you?"" The fan said something which angered Sinatra, who lunged at the fan, and Sinatra had to be restrained.


=== Cocktail books ===
Albert Stevens Crockett, the hotel's veteran publicist and historian, wrote his first cocktail book ""Old Waldorf Bar Days"" in 1931 during Prohibition and the construction of the current hotel on Park Avenue. It was an homage to the original hotel and its famous bar and clientele. The book contains Crockett's takes on the original hand-written leather bound book of recipes that was given to him at the time of the closure by bartender Joseph Taylor. This edition was never reprinted.In 1934, Crockett wrote a second book, ""The Old Waldorf Astoria Bar Book"", in response to the repeal of the Volstead Act and the end of the Prohibition era. He edited out most of the text from the first book. Drawing from his experiences as a travel writer, Crockett added nearly 150 more recipes, the bulk of which can be found in the ""Cuban Concoctions"" and ""Jamaican Jollifers"" chapters. These books became reference books on the subject of pre-Prohibition cocktails and its culture.In 2016, the long-time hotel bar manager of Peacock Alley and La Chine, Frank Caiafa, added a completely new edition to the canon. Caiafa's ""The Waldorf Astoria Bar Book"" includes all of the recipes in Crockett's books; many of the hotel's most important recipes created since 1935; and his own creations. In 2017, it was nominated for a James Beard Foundation Award for Best Beverage Book.Other notable books with connections to the hotel include ""Drinks"" (1914) by Jacques Straub, a wine steward and friend of Oscar Tschirky who had written about the first hotel's notable recipes. Tschirky himself compiled a list of 100 recipes for his own book ""100 Famous Cocktails"" (1934), a selection of favorites from Crockett's books. Finally, hotel publicist Ted Saucier wrote ""Bottoms Up"" in 1951, consisting of a compendium of popular, national recipes of the day.


== Notable residents and tenants ==


=== Leaders and businesspeople ===

On the 100th anniversary of the hotel in 1993, one publication wrote: ""It isn't the biggest hotel in New York, nor the most expensive. But when it comes to prestige, the Waldorf-Astoria has no peer. When presidents come to New York, they stay at the Waldorf-Astoria. Kings and queens make it their home away from home, as have people as diverse as Cary Grant, the Dalai Lama and Chris Evert. Some of them liked the hotel so well, they made their home there."" From its inception, the Waldorf was always a ""must stay"" hotel for foreign dignitaries. The viceroy of China, Li Hung Chang stayed at the hotel in 1896 and feasted on hundred-year-old eggs which he brought with him. Over the years many royals from around the world stayed at the Waldorf Astoria including Shahanshah of Iran and Empress Farah, King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid of Denmark, Princess Astrid of Norway, Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Martha of Norway, King Baudouin I of Belgium and Queen Fabiola, Prince Albert and Princess Paola of Belgium, King Hussein I of Jordan, Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace of Monaco, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, King Michael of Romania, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip of the Commonwealth realms, Mohammed Zahir Shah and Homaira Shah of Afghanistan, King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit of Thailand, and Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko of Japan, Prince Frederick Joseph the great great  grandson of King Joseph Bonaparte and many others. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip stayed at the hotel during their first visit to America on October 21, 1957, and a banquet was held for them in the Grand Ballroom. In the Bicentennial year in 1976, most of the heads of state from around the world and all of the Kings and Queens of Europe were invited to the hotel, and it also served the presidential candidates in the run up to the elections of that year.

In modern times, the clientele of the Waldorf is more typically wealthy politicians and businessmen than playboys and royalty. An entire floor was often rented out to wealthy Saudi Arabians with their own staff. Wealthy Japanese businessmen during their stay would sometimes remove the furniture and replace it with their own floor mats. One early wealthy resident was Chicago businessman J. W. Gates who would gamble on stocks on Wall Street and play poker at the hotel. He paid up to $50,000 a year to hire suites at the hotel. Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was invited by Waldorf president Lucius Bloomer to stay at the hotel in the 1920s. Demands by people of prominence could often be exorbitant or bizarre, and Fidel Castro once walked into the hotel with a flock of live chickens, insisting that they be killed and freshly cooked on the premises to his satisfaction, only to be turned away. While serving as Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger ordered all of the antiques to be removed from one suite and replaced them with 36 desks for his staff. An unnamed First Lady also once demanded that all of the bulbs in her suite be changed to 100 watt ones and kept on all day and night to simulate daylight; she further insisted that there be an abundance of chewing gum available.

Postmaster General James Farley occupied two adjoining suites in the current Waldorf Astoria during his tenure as the chairman of the board of Coca-Cola's International division from 1940 until his death in 1976, arguably one of the landmark's longest housed tenants. The Presidential Suite at the hotel come from when, during the 1950s and early 1960s, former U.S. president Herbert Hoover and retired U.S. General Douglas MacArthur lived in suites on different floors of the hotel. Hoover lived at the Waldorf Astoria for over 30 years from after the end of his presidency until he died in 1964; former President Dwight D. Eisenhower lived there between 1967 and 1969. MacArthur's widow, Jean MacArthur, lived there from 1952 until her death in 2000. A plaque affixed to the wall on the 50th Street side commemorates this. John F. Kennedy was fond of the Waldorf Astoria and had a number of private meetings at the hotel, including one with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. Since Hoover, every President of the United States has either stayed over or lived in the Waldorf Astoria, although Jimmy Carter claimed to have never stayed overnight at the hotel. Nancy Reagan was reputedly not fond of the Presidential Suite.

The official residence of the United States' Permanent Representative to the United Nations, an unnamed 42nd-floor apartment, was located in the Waldorf Towers for many years. On June 17, 2015, however, the US Department of State announced that it was moving its headquarters during meetings of the UN General Assembly to The New York Palace Hotel. Although State Department officials did not give an official reason for the change affecting both the President and hundreds of American diplomats and support staff who travel to New York for the General Assembly each September and usually stay and hold meetings on two secured floors at the Waldorf, they pointed to Hilton Worldwide's sale of the Waldorf-Astoria to China's Beijing-based Anbang Insurance Group for $1.95 billion in 2014, a deal that prompted security concerns. While the terms of the sale allow Hilton to run the hotel for the next 100 years, they also call for ""a major renovation"" that the officials say has raised eyebrows in the US Government because of concerns about Chinese eavesdropping and cyber espionage.Carlos P. Romulo, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines and member of the UN had suite 3600, below Hoover's, for some 45 years from 1935 onwards, and former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos also spent much time and money at the hotel. Another connection with the Philippines is that many meetings were held here between President Manuel L. Quezon and high ranking American politicians and senators. Through the meetings, Quezon encouraged investment into the country and convinced General MacArthur to accompany him back to the Philippines as his military adviser.


=== Celebrities ===

The hotel has had many well-knowns under its roof throughout its history, including Charlie Chaplin, Ava Gardner, Liv Ullmann, Edward G. Robinson, Gregory Peck, Ray Bolger, John Wayne, Tony Bennett, Jack Benny, Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, Muhammad Ali, Vince Lombardi, Judy Garland, Sonny Werblin, Greer Garson, Harold Lloyd, Liberace, Burt Reynolds, Robert Montgomery, Cesar Romero, and many others. Due to the number of high-profile guests staying at the hotel at any one time, author Ward Morehouse III has referred to the Towers as a ""kind of vertical Beverly Hills. On any one given night you might find Dinah Shore, Gregory Peck, Frank Sinatra [or] Zsa Zsa Gabor staying there"". Gabor married Conrad Hilton in 1941. During the 1930s, gangster Benjamin ""Bugsy"" Siegel owned an apartment at the Waldorf, and Frank Costello was said to have got his haircut and nails done in the Barber's Shop at the Waldorf. Around the time of World War I, inventor Nikola Tesla lived in the earlier Waldorf-Astoria.In 1955, Marilyn Monroe and her husband, Arthur Miller stayed at the hotel for several months, but due to costs of trying to finance her production company ""Marilyn Monroe Productions"", only being paid $1,500 a week for her role in The Seven Year Itch and being suspended from 20th Century Fox for walking out on Fox after creative differences, living at the hotel became too costly and Monroe had to move into a different hotel in New York City. Around the same time that Monroe lived in the hotel, Cole Porter and his wife Linda Lee Thomas had an apartment in the Waldorf Towers, where Thomas died in 1954. Porter's 1934 song ""You're the Top"", contains the lyric, ""You're the top, you're a Waldorf salad"". The Cole Porter Suite, Suite 33A, was the place where Porter lived and entertained for a period. Frank Sinatra paid nearly $1 million a year to keep it as his personal suite at the hotel between 1979 and 1988, which he called home when out of Los Angeles. Sinatra took over part of the hotel during the filming of The First Deadly Sin in 1980.

Grace Kelly and Rainier III were regular guests at the hotel. At one time Kelly was reputed to be in love with the hotel banquet manager of the Waldorf, Claudius Charles Philippe. Elizabeth Taylor frequented the hotel, and would often attend galas at the hotel to talk about her various causes. Her visits were excitedly awaited by the hotel staff, who would prepare long in advance. Taylor was honored at the 1983 Friars Club dinner at the hotel.Brooke Shields has stated that her very first encounter with the paparazzi was in the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf at the age of 12, stating that she ""stood like a statue wondering why they were all hired to photograph me"", and that she ""debuted at the Waldorf"".  During her childhood in the 1980s and 1990s, Paris Hilton lived with her family in the hotel.

One of the most prestigious, the most exclusive and the most famous debutante balls in the world is the invitation-only International Debutante Ball held biennially in the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, where girls from prominent world families are presented to high society. Since 1954 the musical entertainment at the ball has traditionally been provided by the musicians of the Lester Lanin Orchestra.


== In popular culture ==
The Waldorf Astoria has been a filming location for numerous films and TV series. Ginger Rogers headlined an all star ensemble cast in the 1945 film Week-End at the Waldorf, set at the hotel and filmed partially on location there. Other films shot at the hotel include The Out-of-Towners (1970), Broadway Danny Rose (1984), Coming to America (1988), Scent of a Woman (1992), The Cowboy Way (1994), Random Hearts (1999), Analyze This (1999), For Love of the Game (1999), Serendipity (2001), The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), Maid in Manhattan (2002), Two Weeks Notice (2002), End of the Century (2005),  Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005), The Pink Panther  (2006), and The Hoax (2006). Television series that have filmed at the Waldorf include Law and Order, Rescue Me, Sex and the City, The Sopranos and Will and Grace.Several biographies have been written about the Waldorf, including Edward Hungerford's Story of the Waldorf (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1925) and Horace Sutton's Confessions of a Grand Hotel: The Waldorf-Astoria (New York: Henry Holt, 1953).Langston Hughes wrote a poem entitled ""Advertisement for the Waldorf-Astoria"", criticizing the hotel and inviting the jobless and homeless to take over the space of the hotel. Wallace Stevens wrote a poem entitled ""Arrival at the Waldorf"", in which he contrasts the wild country of the jungles of Guatemala to being ""back at the Waldorf"". In Meg Cabot's novel Jinx, the Chapman School Spring Formal takes place in the Waldorf-Astoria. It is at this point that Tory (the main antagonist) reveals Jean's first attempt at a love spell, which served as a catalyst for the novel's events.Waldorf of the Muppets series was named after the hotel. In the episode starring Dizzy Gillespie his heckling partner Statler (named after Statler Hilton, also in Manhattan) couldn't make it due to illness so Waldorf's wife Astoria came with him. Ayn Rand biographer Anne Heller wrote that the Waldorf Astoria inspired the ""Wayne-Falkland Hotel"" in Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged.

264,Windsor Way (Vancouver),"Windsor Way is a  special community  street that links four parks and three elementary schools  as well as a bike path in East Vancouver, Canada, which was identified as a local Greenway in the Kensington-Cedar Cottage Visioning process. As there was no funding available to turn the many blocks of this street into a local Greenway, the local community worked with the City of 
Vancouver planning department to implement a demonstration project called ""Blooming Boulevards"". This demonstration project allowed residents to garden the frontages of their yards between the street and the sidewalk. This section of street contains the wires and ducts of the city, and this was the first time that gardening on these city owned frontages was allowed. The program was so successful that Blooming Boulevards are now city policy and  boulevards are now  gardened throughout the city.


== Bike  Route ==
The Windsor Bikeway is a 4.3 km north/south bike route that follows Glen Drive and Windsor Street from Great Northern Way to 43rd Avenue and was chosen for its proximity to Knight Street. This route provides a connection for the Off-Broadway and 10th Avenue Bikeways to the Midtown/Ridgeway and Inverness Bikeways. The Windsor Bikeway passes through Mount Pleasant and Kensington-Cedar Cottage neighbourhoods and goes by Memorial Park South.
Measures along the proposed bikeway to reduce vehicle speeds and to help cyclists cross busy arterials include traffic circles, corner bulges, centre medians, speed humps, and traffic lights controlled by cyclists and pedestrians.
Estimated cycling time for the full length of the Windsor Bikeway is 18 minutes. A leisurely walk from 12th Avenue to 49th Avenue along Windsor Way will take 30 minutes.


== History ==
Without the funding for a greenway, the community along Windsor Street participated in a demonstration project where they gardened the city  owned boulevards in front of each of their residences. This Blooming Boulevard project was wildly successful. The community was also successful in getting a Community Public Art Grant. Public Artist Karen Kazmer created ""Windsor Way-Moments, Memories and Objects"" which are attached to many of the street poles along Windsor Street. The illustrations attached on the street poles are of neighbours' hands, objects in the neighbourhood, and things that have significance to people in the neighbourhood.
A survey was completed in 2001 of local residents to gauge support for the bike path. City Council considered a recommendation from staff in 2003.Windsor Street was selected over other streets near the major north-west transportation corridor, Knight Street, for a number of reasons including:

it is one of the only continuous north/south streets in proximity;
it is one of the better streets for grades (particularly between 33rd and 37th Ave);
there are several parks and schools on this route (e.g. Charles Dickens Elementary School);
local residents strongly supported the bike route; and,
there are significant efforts by local residents to beautify the streetscape through the City's ""Blooming Boulevards"" program.


== Public art ==
Public art has been installed along the Windsor Way bike route to further beautify the corridor and calm traffic.  This work was completed in two phases.
Phase 1 was led by the Mt. Pleasant Community Centre Association, which led what was called ""one of the most successful community public art projects ever"", installing metal banners on street lamps along Windsor Street. Funding was approved by the City in 2002.Phase 2 of the public art portion of this project built on the ""Windsor Way/Art Way"" plan. To support this, the City of Vancouver approved funding ($15,000) for the project in 2004.

266,VCC–Clark station,"VCC–Clark is an elevated station on the Millennium Line of Metro Vancouver's SkyTrain rapid transit system. The station is named after the nearby Vancouver Community College (VCC) located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and serves as the western terminus of the Millennium Line.


== History ==
VCC–Clark station's original plans called for it to be located underground below Broadway to the south of Vancouver Community College, but the City of Vancouver wanted the line to run to the north through an emerging technology zone on the False Creek Flats.
The station was originally planned to open with the original portion of the Millennium Line in 2002, but the construction was delayed because of property issues as the station is located in a former railyard. Service at the station was slated to begin in the fourth quarter of 2005, but testing and commissioning of the station and related facilities continued during that time frame, with trial running of trains starting in mid-November that year. The station, designed by the architecture firms Francl Architecture and Stantec Architecture, officially opened in 2006. A limited-stop bus route, the 84, connects VCC–Clark to UBC to relieve the 99 B-Line bus route and the trolley buses on Broadway.
Plans originally called for the Millennium Line to extend west along the Broadway corridor from VCC–Clark station to Granville Street and 10th Avenue with three additional stations. In 2006, it was revealed that this 5-kilometre (3.1 mi) extension would be placed on hold while priority was given to the Canada Line and Evergreen Extension. In 2018, a 6-kilometre (3.7 mi) extension west to Arbutus Street was approved with an estimated completion date of 2025.

268,Britannia Secondary School,"Britannia Community Secondary School is a public community secondary school located in the Grandview–Woodland neighbourhood on the east-side of Vancouver, British Columbia. The school educates its students using a district-wide block schedule program that alternates four blocks every two days. Students are subject to eight different blocks in total.
The school was founded in 1908 as the second high school to be constructed in the city, and is now the oldest remaining secondary school. The first classes were held in the Admiral Seymour Elementary School building in September 1908. The school moved to the then partially completed Britannia building in 1910. The school colours of red, green, and white and the school motto ""Per Vias Rectas"" were adopted at this time. During the 1966-67 school year, a new wing was constructed and now houses the school office. In 1974, Britannia Secondary became Britannia Elementary-Secondary School. Britannia celebrated its centennial in 2008.
Situated in the Commercial Drive area of Vancouver, Britannia is a part of a larger community site which includes an elementary school, public library, skating rink, fitness facility and swimming pool. Britannia is also host to many other programs in academics, fine arts, leadership and academic tutoring and support. Nearly 200 courses are offered at the school including 19 International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme courses and a Hockey Canada Skills Academy. Britannia athletic teams compete in the Vancouver Secondary School Athletics Association as part of BC School Sports and are known as the Bruins. Notable Britannia alumni include an Order of Canada recipient, a former Premier of British Columbia, and a former Supreme Court of Canada justice.

In September 1955, the gymnasium and cafeteria were added to the 'old building'. It was also at this time that Grades 8 and 9 students were first admitted for enrolment. During the 1966-67 school year, a new wing was constructed providing additional Science, Technology Education, Home Economics, and Business Education classrooms. The new wing now also houses the school office. The new wing was connected to the old building by a walkway which most students call ""the Skywalk.""
In 1974, Britannia Secondary became Britannia Elementary-Secondary School. The elementary section opened its doors on January 9, 1975 to 16 staff and 370 students making a combined student enrollment of approximately 1800. This was also the year of incorporation of the Britannia Community Center Society and the year that Britannia became a community school. Britannia celebrated its centennial in 2008. Britannia alumni assisted in the planning of the celebration.


== Enriched courses ==
Britannia offers an International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme for grades 11–12 and a Venture program for grades 8–10. Britannia and Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School are the only two public secondary schools in Vancouver to offer the programme. The programme offers some course content which is at the first-year university level.
The Venture program, which is based on the mini school concept, prepares students intending to enter IB in grade 11 to gain leadership skills, develop teamwork and offers a more enriching educational experience than regular classes.


== Alternative programs ==
Britannia offers many alternative programs including the Britannia Hockey Academy, which was the first sport-focused academy in the Vancouver school system, and is licensed by the Hockey Canada Skills Academy. Other alternative programs in Britannia are for some students with academic difficulty, and/or have a first nations heritage.


== Facilities ==
Britannia Secondary is unique in having community centre facilities within the complex. The school is situated on a 16 hectare site. The Britannia Community Centre boasts an ice rink, swimming pool, several gyms, a weight room and fitness centre, and Britannia Secondary students often use these facilities in physical education classes and in extracurricular activities.
Britannia also has a library within the community centre that is a Vancouver Public Library. Despite this, britannia added a library to the third floor of the building and students are encouraged to use this instead of the public library. However, students can still use the public library if they have a library card.


== Demographics ==
The Britannia student body comes from a catchment area that includes the neighbourhoods of Strathcona, the Downtown Eastside, and most of Grandview–Woodland. Their area has the highest concentration of Canadian Aboriginal in Vancouver. The Britannia student body also include those from outside the catchment area, as well as outside the district through open enrolment. In 2010, the school had a student body of 748 students in grades 8–12. 28% of the Britannia student population are Canadian Aboriginal, while 4% are ESL students and 2% are non-residents. The school has a student population with at least 38 different languages spoken including Cantonese, Vietnamese, Mandarin and Tagalog. Approximately 30% of Britannia students live in households that receive income assistance or have marginal cost of funds, and 26% of students were identified as having special needs. The school has the lowest Fraser Institute rating with a 3.0/10, the lowest of Vancouver School Board secondary schools. The Britannia graduation rate is 92%.
Alec MacInnes serves as principal, a position he has held since 2019, with Karen Blake and Krista Ediger as vice principals. The staff consists of 3 administrators, 53 full and part-time teachers and 26 support staff members. The school as an average class size of 22.9, which is lower than the district average class size of 24.8.


== Athletics ==

Britannia is predominately an AA school in terms of athletics according to the BC School Sports. The school had a dominant football team in the 1970s, winning the Shrine Bowl Provincial Championships once, and being runners-up three times. In 1974, Britannia hosted their first basketball tournament called the Bruin Invitational Basketball Tournament.  Since then, the tournament is hosted annually and it has been a great success to Britannia.
On March 8, 2008, The Britannia Senior Boys Basketball team won the British Columbia AA Provincial Basketball Tournament by beating the Windsor Dukes 81-73. That was the first time any public school from East Vancouver has won a B.C. boys senior high basketball title.  The next season, Britannia's senior boys team made the 'AA' Provincial final again, but lost to Southern Okanagan Secondary School from Oliver. The following 2010 basketball season saw the Britannia Senior Boys Basketball team return to the AA Provincial Basketball final and defeated the basketball team from RC Palmer Secondary to reclaim the title of AA Provincial Champion.
On March 10, 2012, the Britannia Senior Girls Basketball team also made school history by capturing its first B.C. girls basketball title after a silver medal finish the year before in 2011.  Britannia's senior girls team beat Lambrick Park 69-61 in the AA Provincial basketball final after a fourth quarter surge that saw the Bruins outscore the Pride 21-4.  This tops an incredible feat that has 5 consecutive Britannia basketball teams medal at the AA Provincial Championships since 2008.
Britannia has teams for badminton, basketball, cross country, soccer, table tennis, track and field, ultimate frisbee, and volleyball.


== Notable alumni ==

Britannia has had a history of strong students and alumni over the years. It has produced Premiers, Supreme Court Justices and noted philanthropists over its 102-year history. Notably, in the past three years, Britannia has produced two Loran Scholars (the largest undergraduate scholarship in Canada, at $80,000) and one TD Canada Trust Scholarship recipient ($70,000), the most of any secondary school in Canada.

273,Kitsilano,"Kitsilano  is a neighbourhood located in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Kitsilano is named after Squamish Chief August Jack Khatsahlano, and the neighborhood is located in Vancouver's West Side along the south shore of English Bay, between the neighborhoods of West Point Grey and Fairview.


== Pre-colonial History ==
The name 'Kitsilano' is derived from X̱ats'alanexw, the name of a Squamish chief. The area has been home to the Squamish people (known as Sḵwx̱wú7mesh in the Squamish language) for thousands of years, sharing the territory with the Musqueam and the Tsleil-Waututh Peoples. All three Nations moved throughout their shared traditional territory, using the resources it provided for fishing, hunting, trapping and gathering.


== Post-colonial History and the Unsettling of the Kitsilano Reserve ==
In 1911, the Federal government amended the Indian Act to legalize the unsettling of reserves that “situated wholly or partly within an incorporated town or city having a population of [more] than eight thousand”, without the need for consent from the reserve's residents, as “reserves in more densely populated areas early on became ‘coveted’ by newcomers, who sought to wrest [the Indigenous population] away by licit or illicit means”. Subsequently, both Provincial and Federal governments began the “unsettling of reserves” process, which was the “emptying” of the reserves that “be[came] a source of nuisance and an impediment to progress”, or, in other words, the government unsettled reserves for growing cities and potential business ventures. At this time in Canadian history, the Federal government had already isolated the Indigenous population on to morsels of reserve lands, only to further deprive Indigenous peoples of what the government first thought was negligible land. The amendment to the Indian Act stated that ""an Indian reserve which adjoins or is situated wholly or partly within an incorporated town or city having a population of not less than eight thousand"" could at the recommendation of the Superintendent General be removed without their consent if it was ""having regard to the interest of the public"" and by year end the reserve was sold to the Government of British Columbia. The Squamish Nation formally surrendered the majority of reserve to the federal government in 1946. Part of the expropriated land was used by the Canadian Pacific Railway who pursued selling the land they had deed to in the 1980s despite the original agreement with the Squamish Nation that they should regain control of the land. This went to court, and in August 2002 the B.C. Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's ruling in favour of the Squamish. This Indian reserve land is at the foot of the Burrard Street Bridge, called senakw (commonly spelled Snauq historically) in the Squamish language, and sənaʔqʷ in the Musqueam people's hən'q'əmin'əm' language, where Xats'alanexw, also known as August Jack Khatsahlano, lived.
The forced relocation of the Musqueam Nation by the Canadian government resulted in a Musqueam Reserve created on the north arm of the Fraser River. The Squamish Nation was forcibly relocated to reserves on the north shore of Burrard Inlet, currently known as North Vancouver and West Vancouver, as well as the False Creek Indian Reserve No. 6.


=== False Creek Indian Reserve No. 6 ===
The False Creek Indian Reserve No. 6, also known as the Kitsilano Indian Reserve, is an Indian Reserve developed by the colonial government in 1869. The reserve is located on the former site of a Squamish village, known as ""sən’a?qw"" in hən’q’emin’əm’, the language of the Musqueam people, and as ""Sen’ákw"" in Skwxwú7mesh, the language of the Squamish people. Inside the reserve there was a large longhouse that housed families, held potlach ceremonies, and became a central point of trade. The land appealed to its residents and attracted settlers by providing access to natural resources. It served as an important fishing area where inhabitants could set up tidal weirs of vine maple fencing and nettle fibre nets to catch fish. Additionally, the Squamish People cultivated an orchard as well as cherry trees on this land. Between 1869 and 1965, as the development of railway lines drew attention to the reserve, the Burrard Street Bridge and various leases began to occupy the reserve land. The land set aside for the Squamish people was continually appropriated until it was completely sold off. After decades of legal proceedings, the Squamish Nation reclaimed a small amount of the reserve land in 2002.


== Settler History ==

The city's streetcar lines used to have a ""loop"" at Arbutus & Cornwall, which made ""Greer's Beach,"" as the area first became known after the holdout settler who lived there, easy to get to from the new city, then still mostly contained on the downtown peninsula. With the opening of the Lulu Island Railway interurban line from Granville & Pacific  to Richmond via Seventh Avenue and Arbutus Street to Kerrisdale in the 1890s, more of Kitsilano was put within easy range of downtown and housing and commercial areas carved out of the forests and swamp. The lowland area beyond MacDonald, from 4th Avenue to King Edward, was known as Malaria Flats because of its swampy air. Like most of Vancouver, it had only a few decades before been covered in dense West Coast forest.From the 1890s, the Vancouver Lawn Tennis Club in Granville Park became a trendy club for the local elite, hosting an annual Championship which attracted some nationally successful Canadian players.
Kitsilano was also the site of the first Sikh temple to be built in Canada. Opened in 1908, the temple served early South Asian settlers who worked at nearby sawmills along false creek at the time.The area was an inexpensive neighborhood to live in the 1960s and attracted many from the counterculture  from across Canada and the United States and was known as one of the two hotbeds of the hippie culture in the city, the other being Gastown. However, the area became gentrified by 'yuppies' in subsequent decades. Close proximity to downtown Vancouver, walking distance to parks, beaches and popular Granville Island has made the neighbourhood a very desirable community to live. One of the main concert venues in the city in the days of the counterculture was the Soft Rock Cafe (not to be confused with the Hard Rock Cafe), near 4th and Maple, later rebuilt into a modern shopping complex.
One remaining artifact of the 1960s is the Naam Cafe at 4th and Macdonald, providing vegetarian, vegan, and natural foods. The area is also known for having the first of certain kinds of restaurants, such as the California-style Topanga Cafe. Three of the first neighbourhood pub licenses in Vancouver are still located on 4th Avenue - Bimini's at Maple (reopened after a fire in 2007), Darby D. Dawes at MacDonald, and Jerry's Cove—the original name of Jericho—near Alma.
Greenpeace - founded in the home of Dorothy Stowe at 2775 Courtney Ave. in upper Point Grey near Pacific Spirit Regional Park and UBC -  originally found a home in Kitsilano in the backroom of a small office on the SE corner of Broadway at Cypress, and shortly after that at 2007 4th Ave. and Maple (now 2009 due to address change), sharing the upstairs office with SPEC. The first offices of the Green Party of British Columbia were originally located in the home of longtime party leader Adriane Carr and her husband Paul George on Trafalgar Street, near 6th, in early 1983, before being moved by the summer of that year to offices near Broadway and Cypress, which also became the first offices of the Green Party of Canada.


== Geography ==
The land that is currently known as Kitsilano has been shared by the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Watuth peoples since time immemorial. Thus, their traditional place names are valuable descriptors of this landscape. The area that is currently known as Point Grey is traditionally known as Chitchilayuk. Beaches now known as Spanish Banks is traditionally known as Pookcha, Jericho Beach is traditionally known as Eyalmo and E-Eyalmo, and Kisilano Beach is traditionally known as Skwa-yoos. The area that is currently Sasamat Street was once known as Kokohpai, while the area of Bayswater Street was called Simsahmuls.Kitsilano is located in the West Side of Vancouver, along the southern shore of English Bay, with Burrard Street as the neighborhood's eastern boundary, Alma Street its western boundary, and 16th Avenue its southern boundary.
Adjacent neighbourhoods include the West End northeast across the Burrard Bridge and False Creek, Fairview directly to the east, Shaughnessy to the southeast, Arbutus Ridge directly south, Dunbar-Southlands southwest, and West Point Grey directly west.
Like all of Vancouver, Kitsilano is located in traditional Coast Salish territory.


== Demographics ==
As of 2016, Kitsilano has 43,045 people. 13.3% of the population is under the age of 20; 40.1% is between 20 and 39; 32.8% is between 40 and 64; and 13.8% is 65 or older. 74.2% of Kitsilano residents speak English as a first language, 5.6% speak a Chinese language, 2.6% speak French and 0.2% speaking hən'q'əmin'əm. The median household income is $72,839 and 14.7% of its population lives in low-income households. The unemployment rate is 5.2%.


== Arts, Entertainment, and Culture ==
With a population of 40,595 people as of 2006, the area is mostly residential with two main commercial areas, West 4th Avenue and West Broadway, known for their retail stores, restaurants and organic food markets. Notable landmarks in Kitsilano include the Burrard Bridge, Kitsilano Beach, and the Museum of Vancouver/H. R. MacMillan Space Centre.
The Museum of Vancouver has gained several pieces of Northwest Coast from Indigenous artists. Much of the work is displayed in a wide variety of mediums to showcase the Indigenous culture that surrounds this city.The neighborhood has played host to a number of annual events such as the Vancouver International Children's Festival, the Bard on the Beach outdoor Shakespeare festival, and the Celebration of Light fireworks competition. Indigenous murals can be seen as the connection between the City of Reconciliation and the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh First Nations. The goal is to expose the public to the culturally contemporary Indigenous artists that are present in today's society.Kitsilano is the current or former home of a number of notable residents including environmentalist David Suzuki, writers William Gibson and Philip K. Dick, actors Ryan Reynolds, Jason Priestley, and Joshua Jackson, ice hockey players Trevor Linden and Ryan Kesler, and comedian Brent Butt.
Kitsilano is home to a number of Vancouver's annual festivals and events:

Each June, Greek Day is an annual street festival celebrating Greek culture and cuisine along several blocks of Greek West Broadway, which is Vancouver's Greektown.
Vanier Park is home to the Vancouver International Children's Festival (at Granville Island as of 2014) and ""Bard on the Beach"", the outdoor Shakespeare festival.
The Celebration of Light is held on the waters of English Bay between Vanier Park and the West End.
The Khatsahlano Street Party is held on 4th Avenue on a July Saturday.


== Attractions ==


=== Parks and beaches ===
Kitsilano is home to 17 parks, which include six playgrounds, an off-leash dog park, and Kitsilano Beach, one of Vancouver's most popular beaches. Along with the beach itself, Kitsilano Beach Park also contains a franchise restaurant, Kitsilano Pool, and the Kitsilano Showboat. The Kitsilano Showboat, operating since 1935, is essentially an open-air amphitheatre with the ocean and mountains as a backdrop. All summer long, the showboat hosts free performances from local bands, dance groups, and other performers. Its main goal is to entertain residents and tourists, showcasing amateur talent. It is located on the south side of the Kitsilano Pool along Cornwall Avenue. Weather permitting, shows typically start at 7:30 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays. Beatrice Leinbach, or Captain Bea, has been playing a role in maintaining the showboat since the mid-1940s. As of 2006, she is the president of the non-profit Kitsilano Showboat Society.As of September 2018, there was an attempt to reconcile with the Indigenous communities whose land was taken during the expansion of Vancouver. By renaming the beaches and parks, one of which included Kitsilano Beach, Stuart Mackinnon park board chairman was going to work with the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations to rename those areas after their original Indigenous names. However, the Indigenous community replied by saying the original areas were not named previously, because they were only forests before colonization. As of today no beaches or parks, including Kitsilano Beach have been renamed in the hən'q'əmin'əm' (Musqueam Halkomelem) or Skwxwú7mesh Snichim (squamish language).  
Vanier Park is another one of Kitsilano's most popular parks, and is the location of the Museum of Vancouver, the H. R. MacMillan Space Centre, the Vancouver Maritime Museum, as well as the public art installations Gate to the Northwest Passage by artist Alan Chung Hung and ""Freezing Water #7"" by Jun Ren.


=== Buildings ===
Landmark buildings in Kitsilano include the Burrard Bridge, a five-lane, Art Deco style, steel truss bridge constructed in 1930-1932 connecting downtown Vancouver with Kitsilano via connections to Burrard Street on both ends, as well as several historic sites such as the Museum of Vancouver and H. R. MacMillan Space Centre, St. Roch National Historic Site of Canada, Kitsilano Secondary School, General Gordon Elementary School and the Bessborough Armoury. Busy Macdonald Street and some quiet, leafy adjoining streets still have some 1910s–1920s craftsman houses that cannot be found anywhere else in Vancouver. According to Exploring Vancouver, an architectural guide to the city: Kitsilano developed as a less expensive suburban alternative to the West End. Endless rows of developer-built houses lined the grid of streets, their gabled roofs picturesque and not boring. Many (...) resemble West End houses of preceding years, but have the wider proportions, broad verandahs, and wood brackets popularized by the newer and trendier California bungalow.


== Government ==
Kitsilano is situated within the Canadian federal electoral districts of Vancouver Quadra and Vancouver Centre, currently held by Joyce Murray and Hedy Fry, respectively. Both are members of the Liberal Party of Canada. Provincially, Kitsilano lies within the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia electoral districts of Vancouver-Point Grey, Vancouver-Fairview, and Vancouver-False Creek. Vancouver-Point Grey is currently held by David Eby of the BC NDP, Vancouver-Fairview by fellow BC NDP member George Heyman, and Vancouver-False Creek by BC Liberal Sam Sullivan.

275,Prospect Point (British Columbia),"Prospect Point is a point at the northern tip of Stanley Park in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, located on the south side of the First Narrows of Burrard Inlet.  The point, which as its name suggests, is a viewpoint, landmark and tourist attraction in Stanley Park and has a restaurant and other facilities, is just west of the Lions Gate Bridge.

The location of the point is known in the Skwxwu7mesh (Squamish) language as Chay-thoos, meaning ""high bank"".  According to Pauline Johnson's account in Legends of Vancouver, in Skwxwu7mesh tradition inside the cliffs that mark the point from the water lived a spirit-being with the power to bring storms and rain.

276,Frances Street Squats,"The Frances Street Squats were a set of six squatted houses, including one women-only squat, that existed between February and November 27, 1990 in Vancouver in one of the most successful public squats in Canada.


== Going public ==
An early press release by the squatters stated: ""We are some of the many squatters in Vancouver who are occupying several of the hundreds of habitable houses left vacant by developers. These houses have been slated for demolition and gentrification. In the face of unregulated rent increases, and out of necessity, we have chosen to squat as one of many viable means of protesting this atrocity. Housing is not a luxury, it is a right, and these houses are available now. New developments must be kept within an affordable price range for all people presently affected by the housing crisis. We are currently organizing various neighbourhood inclusive community events (potluck barbecues, daycare facilities, community gardening and recycling) in an effort to open up communication between squatters and paying tenants. We intend to defend these houses. We have been forced to go public at this time because we are in danger of losing our homes."" 


== Community support ==
Although the squatters were threatened with arrest for ""assault by trespass"" they gained widespread support from neighbours, the community and area organizations Downtown Eastside Residents Association and Grandview-Woodland Area Council because of their community-based approach.


== Eviction ==
The squats ended when the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) deployed at least 100 officers to evict the squatters. 12 were charged with mischief and obstructing a police officer.Prior to the police operation media liaison officer Bob Cooper claimed the VPD had ""very reliable information that radical elements have taken control of the issue"" and that squatters were in possession of ""three shotguns, two handguns, molotov-cocktails, and other homemade weapons."" 


== Demolition ==
After the eviction no weapons were found and the police action was subsequently dubbed ""Operation Overkill"" by the community. Two days later the city council, under then-mayor Gordon Campbell and with the full support of opposition members (including Libby Davies), declared the houses a ""public nuisance"" and granted a demolition permit.


== The Beat of Frances Street ==
A 48-minute documentary, The Beat of Frances Street: Squatting in East Vancouver, was produced during the late and final stages of the squats. The first half of the film contains footage of everyday life in the houses and presents responses to the question ""why do you squat?"" by fourteen residents. The second half of the film focuses on internal arguments over the use of barricades against imminent police assault and documentation of the assault itself (including commercial news footage) and community response.

277,Kitsilano Secondary School,"Kitsilano Secondary School is a public secondary school in the Kitsilano neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The school has several district programs including French immersion and on-site pre-employment. Advanced Placement courses are also offered.


== The School ==
The first students selected royal blue and gold as the school colours, based on those at Aberdeen University (the Alma Mater of one of their teachers); the first Latin classes chose ""Fiat Lux"" (Let there be light) as the school motto. The original school crest was designed by Mr. S. P. Judge, the first art teacher at Kitsilano, and although the crest has undergone some slight changes over the decades, it still proudly displays the colours and motto.
The school is particularly well known for the numerous television and film productions which have been filmed there. Disturbing Behavior, Big Bully, Anything for Love, The Santa Claus 2, 21 Jump Street, and Party of Five used Kitsilano as a filming location. The school also counts a number of former alumni who went on to careers in film and television, notably Ryan Reynolds and Joshua Jackson.
The school song ""Hail Kitsilano""  was composed in 1936 by Mr. Ivor Parfitt.The main foyer is home to a portrait of Chief August Jack Khahtsahlano, the school's namesake. The auditorium houses a Tanu totem pole, carved by Don Yeomans in 1986 in honour of Vancouver's centennial anniversary.


== Kits Sports ==
In addition to its distinguished academic record, Kitsilano has been highly successful in a number of sports, most prominently, basketball, rugby, soccer, ice-hockey, and cheer. It won provincial basketball championships in 1997, were the City and District Champions and went to the Provincial finals in 1977, and more recently the HSBC Vancouver basketball tournament in 2007.


== History and facilities ==
Kitsilano Secondary School was founded in 1917, when overflow classes from King Edward High School were moved to Cecil Rhodes School.  The first temporary wooden structures for the new school were built in 1920 at Trafalgar and 12th Avenue. The current building was designed by Vancouver VSB staff architect Frank A.A. Barrs and opened in 1927.  In 1958, a Modernist-style addition designed by school architect Allan B. Wilson was added to the south side of the original building.  In 1973 a single storey concrete structure was added on the southeast corner of the site.In 2010 the school board approved a concept plan for the seismic upgrades to the facility.  In October 2011 the provincial government announced a $57.8 million restoration project that will include seismic upgrades and new construction meeting Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Standards.  In 2012 three design-build partners, each comprising a general contractor and an architectural firm, were shortlisted for the project.  In August 2013 it was announced that the Bouygues Building Canada team were selected to design and build the renovation and expansion.Construction began on the south east corner in 2014. This involved the removal of the tennis and volleyball courts. The new academic wing was completed in the summer of 2015 and the school's renovations were finished by fall 2017.


== Incidents ==
On April 5, 2013 students, parents and staff were informed that an incident involving two students and a staff member may have occurred during a school trip two years earlier. The teacher involved was placed on paid leave. Neither the Vancouver School Board or Vancouver Police Department will discuss the specifics of the allegations. No charges have ever been filed.On January 31, 2018 a groping incident between students occurred at a school dance. The incident was under investigation as of February 3, 2018 according to a Vancouver School Board spokesman. Parents were also informed by administration about the incident.


== Notable alumni ==
Kathleen Heddle, Olympic rower, 3-time Gold medallist
Josh Holmes, Video game designer
Joshua Jackson, actor
Levon Kendall, professional basketball player
Boris Malagurski, film director, producer, writer, political commentator, and television host

278,Lions Gate Bridge,"The Lions Gate Bridge, opened in 1938 and officially known as the First Narrows Bridge, is a suspension bridge that crosses the first narrows of Burrard Inlet and connects the City of Vancouver, British Columbia, to the North Shore municipalities of the District of North Vancouver, the City of North Vancouver, and West Vancouver. The term ""Lions Gate"" refers to the Lions, a pair of mountain peaks north of Vancouver. Northbound traffic on the bridge heads in their general direction. A pair of cast concrete lions, designed by sculptor Charles Marega, were placed on either side of the south approach to the bridge in January 1939.The total length of the bridge including the north viaduct is 1,823 metres (5,981 ft). The length including approach spans is 1,517.3 metres (4,978 ft), the main span alone is 473 metres (1,552 ft), the tower height is 111 metres (364 ft), and it has a ship's clearance of 61 metres (200 ft). Prospect Point in Stanley Park offered a good high south end to the bridge, but the low flat delta land to the north required construction of the extensive North Viaduct.
The bridge has three reversible lanes, the use of which is indicated by signals. The centre lane changes direction to accommodate for traffic patterns. The traffic volume on the bridge is 60,000–70,000 vehicles per day. Trucks exceeding 13 tonnes (12.8 long tons; 14.3 short tons) are prohibited, as are vehicles using studded tires. The bridge forms part of Highways 99 and 1A.
On March 24, 2005, the Lions Gate Bridge was designated a National Historic Site of Canada.


== History ==
In 1890, land speculator George Grant Mackay wrote in the local paper that he foresaw a bridge over the first narrows. The decision on whether to build the bridge was put to the electorate of Vancouver in 1927, but the first plebiscite was defeated and the idea was put to rest for the time being.Alfred James Towle Taylor, an engineer with a land interest in the construction of the bridge, worked to overcome local opposition to its construction. Taylor was able to convince the Guinness family (of the Irish stout fame) to invest in the land on the north shore of Burrard Inlet. They purchased 1,902 hectares (4,700 acres) of West Vancouver mountainside through a syndicate called British Pacific Properties Ltd.

On December 13, 1933, a second plebiscite was held, passing with 70 percent in favour. After considerable further negotiations with the federal government, approval was finally granted, with the requirement that Vancouver materials and workmen be used as much as possible to provide employment during the Great Depression. The 1933 bylaw authorizing construction included a provision mandating that ""no Asiatic person shall be employed in or upon any part of the undertaking or other works"".The bridge was designed by the Montreal firm Monsarrat and Pratley, which was later responsible for the Angus L. Macdonald Bridge in Halifax, Nova Scotia, using a similar design. Other companies involved in the construction of the bridge included Swan Wooster Engineering, Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade & Douglas, Rowan Williams Davies & Irwin Inc., Canron Western Constructors, Dominion Bridge Company, American Bridge Company.

Construction began on March 31, 1937. After one and a half years and a cost of CA$5,873,837.17, the bridge opened to traffic on November 14, 1938. On May 29, 1939, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth presided over the official opening during a royal visit to Canada. A toll of 25 cents was charged for each car or horse and carriage; five cents was charged for pedestrians or bicycles.On January 20, 1955, the Guinness family sold the bridge to the province of British Columbia for $5,873,837.17 – the cost of the original construction. The newly constructed bridge differed from the current configuration of the bridge as it originally had only two lanes. Yet, as had been foreseen, West Vancouver's population boomed as a result of the new connection. Thus, to accommodate the increased population, the lanes were divided into three with the middle lane acting as a passing lane. Eventually overhead lane control signals were installed, enabling traffic in the centre lane to be directed in either direction, and facilitating emergency vehicle access by closing off the centre lane.
Another difference with the original configuration was that in an effort to recover the expenditure it cost to build the bridge, the Guinness family had toll booths installed. The toll remained on the bridge until April 1, 1963. Changes were made shortly after, as the tolls were removed and overhead lane controls were added.In 1975, the deteriorating original concrete deck of the North Viaduct was replaced with a lighter, wider, and stronger steel orthotropic deck with wider lanes. This was carried out in sections using a series of short closures of the bridge; each time, one old section was lowered from the bridge and its replacement was put into place.In 1986 the Guinness family, as a gift to Vancouver, purchased decorative lights that make it a distinctive nighttime landmark. In July 2009, the bridge's lighting system was updated with new LED lights to replace its system of 100-watt mercury vapour bulbs. The switch to LEDs was expected to reduce power consumption on the bridge by 90 per cent and save the provincial government about $30,000 a year in energy and maintenance costs.

From 2000 to 2001, the replacement of the entire suspended structure of the original suspension bridge was undertaken without interruption of peak-hour traffic – the first time an entire suspended structure of a major suspension bridge was replaced while in daily use. As with the 1975 replacement work, this was facilitated by a series of separate nighttime and weekend closures to replace one section at a time. The old suspended section was lowered to a barge, and the new lighter and wider orthotropic deck section raised into place and connected. The new deck was designed with the two pedestrian walkways cantilevered to the outside of the suspension cables and the three road lanes widened from 3 to 3.6 metres (10 to 12 ft) each. As a result of the 2001 replacement, the 63-year-old ""suspension bridge, not designed for durability, was given a new lease of life"".


== In popular culture ==
The bridge is often used in television broadcasts as a symbol of Vancouver; most telecasts of NHL hockey games played in Vancouver show the bridge at least once.
The bridge is the namesake of locally founded film company Lionsgate.
It was featured as a set for the opening falling bridge scene in the 2011 film Final Destination 5.

279,Seawall (Vancouver),"The seawall in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, is a stone wall that was constructed around the perimeter of Stanley Park to prevent erosion of the park's foreshore. Colloquially, the term also denotes the pedestrian, bicycle, and rollerblading pathway on the seawall, one which has been extended far outside the boundaries of Stanley Park and which has become one of the most-used features of the park by both locals and tourists. James ""Jimmy"" Cunningham, a master mason, dedicated his life to the construction of the seawall from 1931 until his retirement. Even after he retired, Cunningham continued to return to monitor the wall's progress, until his death at 85. While the whole path is not built upon the seawall; the total distance from CRAB park, around Stanley Park and False Creek to Spanish Banks is about 30 kilometres (19 mi).
Despite perennial conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists, and inline skaters, park users consider the seawall to be the most important feature of Stanley Park and it is the most used feature within the park.


== Construction ==
The original idea for the seawall is attributed to park board superintendent, W. S. Rawlings, who conveyed his vision in 1918: It is not difficult to imagine what the realization of such an undertaking would mean to the attractions of the park and personally I doubt if there exists anywhere on this continent such possibilities of a combined park and marine walk as we have in Stanley Park. The proposal was made to the federal government that it should help finance seawall construction because it owned the park and only leased the land to the city. It was argued that the waves created by ships passing through the First Narrows were eroding the area between Prospect Point and Brockton Point. On this basis, the federal government helped pay for the wall only until 1967 because the portions of the park vulnerable to erosion were now protected.

Most of the Stanley Park portion of the wall was built between 1917 and 1971, although the park portion was not completed until 1980.
Much of the original wall was constructed under the direction of James ""Jimmy"" Cunningham, a master stonemason who spent 32 years on the project until his death at 85. Cunningham continued supervising construction into his last days despite being ill and, on at least one occasion, went to check the seawall's progress still wearing pajamas. He died on 29 September 1963, long before the wall was finished, but remains the one most associated with the project, and a commemorative plaque can be found near Siwash Rock, where his ashes were also scattered. In contrast to the continuity during Cunningham's oversight of the project, construction of the seawall was intermittent, owing to the short-term funding commitments of the civic and federal governments. The first 4,000 feet (1,200 m) was completed between 1914 and 1916. A series of storms threatened the foreshore near Second Beach during the war, when water flooded the patch of land between the beach and Lost Lagoon. In 1920, the wall served as a workfare project for 2,300 unemployed men (the largest number of workers at any one time), and by 1939, an additional 8,000 feet (2,400 m) of the wall was finished. Another 9,100 feet (2,800 m) was built between 1950 and 1957, and the final 2,500 feet (760 m) was not taken on until 1968. On 26 September 1971, the last block, completing the original vision of the seawall, was tapped into place by H. H. Stevens, who also helped initiate the project in 1914 as a Member of Parliament for Vancouver. Others who laboured on the wall included unemployed relief workers again during the Great Depression, and seamen from HMCS Discovery on Deadman's Island facing punishment detail in the 1950s. Also in that decade, stone sets from the recently dismantled BC Electric Railway streetcar system were incorporated into the seawall. The original Stanley Park section of the 22 kilometres (14 mi) Vancouver Seawall is approximately 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) from Coal Harbour / Vancouver Rowing Club to Second Beach.


== Seawall conflict ==
A protracted conflict between pedestrians and cyclists plagued the seawall for years. Strolling pedestrians took issue with cyclists speeding by, while cyclists felt they had a right to cycle the seawall. As traffic increased over time, collisions were becoming more frequent. Cycling on the seawall was consequently outlawed, and by 1976, the Vancouver Police Department had issued 3,000 tickets to offenders. A solution was proposed in 1977 by a Calgary-based group of charitable foundations. It offered to pay $900,000 to widen the path on the English Bay side to 6 metres (20 ft) in order to accommodate both cyclists and pedestrians on the condition that the city match that amount. The proposal triggered an outcry from environmentalist groups, such as the Save Our Parkland Association. City council nonetheless agreed to the plan, but conflict between user groups persisted. The issue was not resolved until 1984 when the bicycle lane of the seawall was designated one-way in a counterclockwise direction around the park, which it remains today. That resolution brought fewer accidents, but as late as 1993, proposals to ban cycling on the seawall continued to be put forth. The popularity of inline skating in the 1990s also contributed to the debate over seawall use, as well as skateboarders to a lesser extent, until users were divided into wheeled versus non-wheeled camps. It appears unlikely that a consensus will emerge over the most appropriate mode of travelling the seawall, but as long as accidents remain minimal, it is unlikely to re-emerge as a pressing park-use issue. A survey conducted for a 1992 task force on the park found that 65% of park users supported bicycle traffic on the seawall compared with 20% who favoured banning cyclists so of course the task force's recommendation to phase out cycling went unheeded.The seawall route has continued to expand, so that a continuous, mostly seaside, path for pedestrians, cyclists, and inline skaters now extends for a total of 22 kilometres (14 mi). Starting from Coal Harbour, it winds around Stanley Park, along Sunset Beach, around False Creek, past the Burrard Street Bridge, through Vanier Park, and finishes at Kitsilano Beach Park.

280,Siwash Rock,"Siwash Rock, also known by its Squamish name Skalsh or Slhx̱í7lsh, is a famous rock outcropping in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada's Stanley Park. A legend among the Indigenous Squamish people surrounds the rock. It is between 15 and 18 metres (49 and 59 ft) tall. It became known to mariners as Nine Pin Rock for its vague resemblance to a bowling pin.


== Geology ==
About 32 million years ago, a volcanic dike formed in the sedimentary rock that forms the foundation of the park (sandstone and mudstone). Magma was forced to the surface through a fissure in the Earth's crust creating the basalt stack, which is more resistant to erosion than the softer sandstone cliffs. Siwash Rock is the only such sea stack in the Vancouver area.


== Name ==

The Squamish name for the rock is Slhx̱i7lsh.  This name refers to the story of a man transformed by X̱aays.  The hole in the rock is where Slhx̱i7lsh kept his fishing tackle, according to Andrew Paull. In Legends of Vancouver, poet Pauline Johnson relates a Squamish legend of how a man was transformed into Siwash Rock ""as an indestructible monument to Clean Fatherhood."" A plaque near the rock (pictured) states that it is ""Skalsh the unselfish,"" who was transformed by ""Q'uas the transformer"" as a reward for unselfishness.There is some controversy over the name of the rock. ""Siwash"" is a Chinook Jargon word for a person of First Nations or Native American heritage. Though the word 'siwash' in the jargon did not necessarily have a negative connotation and was used by native peoples themselves, its etymology can be traced to the French word ""sauvage,"" which means wild or undomesticated. The word is considered by some to be derisive, but remains in use in certain place names and other contexts without derogatory associations, as with Siwash Rock, Siwash Sweater, etc.


== History ==

Up on the cliffs overlooking Siwash Rock is a lookout point off the Siwash hiking trail. While today it is an ideal spot for park users to admire the scenery, it was known as ""Fort Siwash"" during the wars. An artillery battery was mounted there in the First World War, as were searchlights in the next war. A runaway mountain goat, according to park board lore, lived free in this area for almost a year in the mid-1960s until he was hit by a car and died in another area in the park. Also residing in this area, until he was arrested shortly after the Second World War, was a man living in a nearby cave for a 17-year period interrupted only by his service overseas to fight in the war.The small Douglas fir atop Siwash Rock that helped make it such a distinctive landmark for the first generations of Vancouverites did not survive the exceptionally dry summer of 1965. An article on the tree’s passing in the Vancouver Sun reads more like an obituary than news story, quoting former Vancouver Member of Parliament, H. H. Stevens as saying “I’ve known that tree for about 68 years now and I’m sorry the tree has died because it was one of our main attractions in Stanley Park.” A park superintendent felt sure that it was “virtually impossible to establish another fir up on the rock from a young plant.” Less than three years later, however, while park crews were still working to restore the park’s forest from the devastation of Typhoon Freda, persistent efforts were rewarded when new saplings finally began taking root.In 2017, Vancouver Park Board commissioner Catherine Evans introduced a motion to change the rock's official name to Slhx̱í7lsh. As Siwash is derived etymologically from sauvage (the French word for savage), Evans said: ""We shouldn't have a name for any part of our land that is derogatory to the Indigenous people of this land.""

281,Capilano River,"The Capilano River flows from north to south through the Coast Mountains on Vancouver's North Shore between West Vancouver and North Vancouver (district municipality) and empties into Burrard Inlet, opposite Stanley Park. The river is one of three primary sources of drinking water for residents of Greater Vancouver, and flows through the Capilano watershed. The Cleveland Dam, built in 1954, impounds a reservoir for this purpose. The entire area of the reservoir and watershed area upstream of the dam is closed to the public to ensure the quality of the drinking water. 
Prior to construction of the Cleveland Dam, the Capilano River deposited large amounts of sediment into Burrard Inlet.  A dredge was needed to remove this sediment build-up in order to keep Burrard Inlet open for ship traffic.
The Capilano has a historic salmon run which was impacted by the dam construction. In 1971 the Capilano Fish hatchery was opened. It was built 1/2 kilometre (km) downstream of the dam to ensure the survival of the run. Beyond strengthening the salmon stocks from the aftermath of the dam, the hatchery’s work also introduced chinook to the system in an attempt to establish a self-sustaining run.
The river flows through coastal rainforest and, in its lower stretches, follows a granite canyon with walls in excess of 40 metres tall in places.
The Capilano flows during periods of snow melt and rainfall mainly and slows to a trickle at other times.
The origin of the name Capilano River is obscure.  The name is thought to be an anglicized form of names that were Squamish and Musqueam.  The last man known as Chief Capilano died in 1870.


== Route ==

Capilano River's headwaters are at the top of Capilano Mountain, near Furry Creek. The river then continues down in a valley where many tributaries flow into the river like Eastcap Creek. The river then bends towards its tributary Sister's Creek which has its source at The Lions. Shortly past that confluence, the Capilano River flows into Capilano Lake, created by Cleveland Dam. When the river flows out of the dam it enters Capilano Canyon which it stays for about 4 km. After that it enters into its lowland and enters its mouth at Burrard Inlet, near Ambleside Park.


== Recreation ==

When the river is running, whitewater kayakers in boats and apparel can often be seen. The river is rated as class III though at high water it can be much more challenging.The Capilano River Regional Park, which surrounds the river and incorporates the fish hatchery, provides several kilometres of easy to moderate hiking trails alongside the river.
Every year in March the Capilano River is host to an annual charity duck race. Thousands of yellow rubber ducks are purchased ahead of time by the public. They float down the river in a sea of yellow. The first ducks to reach the mouth of the river win prizes for their owners.


== Accidents ==

There have been occasional accidents involving the surge of water released from Cleveland Dam. The operator of Cleveland Dam and Capilano River Regional Park, Metro Vancouver, does not have a public alarm system to warn visitors of a rapid water release from the dam.

282,X̱wemelch'stn,"X̱wemelch'stn [χʷəməltʃʼstn], usually anglicized as Homulchesan, is a large community within the Squamish Nation of the Squamish people, who are a part of the Coast Salish ethnic and linguistic group.  The name X̱wemelch'stn, translates to ""Fast Moving Water of Fish"", relating to the Capilano River.  The village is one of the oldest and major villages of the Squamish and continues to be so, being the Squamish Nation's most populated reserve.  The community is also known as the Capilano Indian Reserve, formally Capilano Indian Reserve No. 5, and is named like the adjacent Capilano River after the Capilano chieftaincy, the best-known Joe Capilano.  The name Kiapila'noq means ""people of Kiap"", and was the title of the supreme chief of the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh in the area of English Bay.  Chief George Capilano was the chief who met Captain Vancouver at X̱wemelch'stn in 1792, and had met Captain Cook in 1782.


== Population and Services ==
The community to date hold more than 500 houses, along with the newly named Chief Joe Mathias Centre, the ""Little Ones School"", the Squamish Nation Youth Centre, as well as many small businesses.


== History ==
X̱wemelch'stn first entered recorded history at the time of the voyage of Captain George Vancouver, when it and neighboring X̱wáýx̱way, across the inlet on the eastern peninsula of what is now Stanley Park, otherwise known as Lumberman's Arch, became recorded in the Captain's journals.  At the time it was a palisaded village  and one of the largest Sḵwxwú7mesh villages in the Burrard Inlet.


== Developments ==
The Capilano Reserve is the site of major commercial and residential developments, mostly on the West Vancouver side of its area.  These include the Park Royal Shopping Centre and associated apartment buildings, and a small office tower adjacent to the intersection of Taylor Way, and a large recreational vehicle park more or less beneath the northern end of the Lions Gate Bridge (the highway interchange for the bridge is also on reserve land).  Foreshore properties along Vancouver Harbour leased from reserve lands include bulk terminals and other port facilities.  Revenues from all these arrangements are part of band finances.

283,"Granville, British Columbia","Granville was the name from 1870 to 1886 for what would become the townsite of Vancouver, British Columbia.
The townsite included the original settlement of Gastown.


== History ==
The area was first known as Gastown, a settlement around the original makeshift tavern established by ""Gassy"" Jack Deighton in 1867 just west of the Hastings Mill property.
In 1870 the colonial government surveyed the settlement, laid out a townsite, and renamed it ""Granville"" in honour of the then-British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Granville.  The township comprised six city blocks from Burrard Inlet south to Hastings Street, and Cambie Street east to Carrall Street.
This site, with its natural harbour, was selected in 1884
as the terminus for the railroad, renamed Vancouver, and incorporated as a city in 1886.
The name Granville survives in the city of Vancouver as Granville Street, Granville Mall, Granville Entertainment District, Granville Square, Granville Street Bridge, Granville Station of the Expo Line, Granville Island, and Vancouver Granville electoral district.

284,Vancouver,"Vancouver ( (listen) van-KOO-vər) is a major city in western Canada, located in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia. As the most populous city in the province, the 2016 census recorded 631,486 people in the city, up from 603,502 in 2011. The Greater Vancouver area had a population of 2,463,431 in 2016, making it the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada. Vancouver has the highest population density in Canada, with over 5,400 people per square kilometre, which makes it the fifth-most densely populated city with over 250,000 residents in North America, behind New York City, Guadalajara, San Francisco, and Mexico City. Vancouver is one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse cities in Canada: 52% of its residents are not native English speakers, 48.9% are native speakers of neither English nor French, and 50.6% of residents belong to visible minority groups.Vancouver is consistently named as one of the top five worldwide cities for livability and quality of life, and the Economist Intelligence Unit acknowledged it as the first city ranked among the top ten of the world's most well-living cities for ten consecutive years. However, Vancouver also ranks as the most expensive city to live in Canada and as the fourth-most expensive housing market globally. In 2011, the city planned to become the greenest city in the world by 2020. Vancouverism is the city's urban planning design philosophy.
Vancouver was originally named Gastown and began as a settlement which grew around the site of a makeshift tavern on the western edges of Hastings Mill that was built on July 1, 1867 and owned by proprietor Gassy Jack. The original site is marked by the Gastown steam clock. Gastown then formally registered as a townsite dubbed Granville, Burrard Inlet. The city was renamed ""Vancouver"" in 1886, through a deal with the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The Canadian Pacific transcontinental railway was extended to the city by 1887. The city's large natural seaport on the Pacific Ocean became a vital link in the trade between Asia-Pacific, East Asia, Europe, and Eastern Canada.Vancouver has hosted many international conferences and events, including the 1954 Commonwealth Games, UN Habitat I, Expo 86, APEC Canada 1997, the World Police and Fire Games in 1989 and 2009; several matches of 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup including the finals at BC Place in Downtown Vancouver, and the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics which were held in Vancouver and Whistler, a resort community 125 km (78 mi) north of the city. In 1969, Greenpeace was founded in Vancouver. The city became the permanent home to TED conferences in 2014.
As of 2016, Port Metro Vancouver is the fourth-largest port by tonnage in the Americas, the busiest and largest in Canada, and the most diversified port in North America. While forestry remains its largest industry, Vancouver is well known as an urban centre surrounded by nature, making tourism its second-largest industry. Major film production studios in Vancouver and nearby Burnaby have turned Greater Vancouver and nearby areas into one of the largest film production centres in North America, earning it the nickname ""Hollywood North"".


== Etymology ==
The city takes its name from George Vancouver, who explored the inner harbour of Burrard Inlet in 1792 and gave various places British names. The family name ""Vancouver"" itself originates from the Dutch ""Van Coevorden"", denoting somebody from the city of Coevorden, Netherlands. The explorer's ancestors came to England ""from Coevorden"", which is the origin of the name that eventually became ""Vancouver"".


== History ==


=== Before 1850 ===
Archaeological records indicate that Aboriginal people were already living in the ""Vancouver"" area from 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. The city is located in the traditional and presently unceded territories of the Squamish, Musqueam, and Tsleil-Waututh (Burrard) peoples of the Coast Salish group. They had villages in various parts of present-day Vancouver, such as Stanley Park, False Creek, Kitsilano, Point Grey and near the mouth of the Fraser River. The region where Vancouver is currently located was referred to in contemporary Halkomelem as Lhq’á:lets, meaning ""wide at the bottom/end"".
Europeans became acquainted with the area of the future Vancouver when José María Narváez of Spain explored the coast of present-day Point Grey and parts of Burrard Inlet in 1791—although one author contends that Francis Drake may have visited the area in 1579.The explorer and North West Company trader Simon Fraser and his crew became the first-known Europeans to set foot on the site of the present-day city. In 1808, they travelled from the east down the Fraser River, perhaps as far as Point Grey.


=== Early growth ===

The Fraser Gold Rush of 1858 brought over 25,000 men, mainly from California, to nearby New Westminster (founded February 14, 1859) on the Fraser River, on their way to the Fraser Canyon, bypassing what would become Vancouver. Vancouver is among British Columbia's youngest cities; the first European settlement in what is now Vancouver was not until 1862 at McCleery's Farm on the Fraser River, just east of the ancient village of Musqueam in what is now Marpole. A sawmill established at Moodyville (now the City of North Vancouver) in 1863, began the city's long relationship with logging. It was quickly followed by mills owned by Captain Edward Stamp on the south shore of the inlet. Stamp, who had begun logging in the Port Alberni area, first attempted to run a mill at Brockton Point, but difficult currents and reefs forced the relocation of the operation in 1867 to a point near the foot of Dunlevy Street. This mill, known as the Hastings Mill, became the nucleus around which Vancouver formed. The mill's central role in the city waned after the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in the 1880s. It nevertheless remained important to the local economy until it closed in the 1920s. The settlement, which came to be called Gastown, grew quickly around the original makeshift tavern established by ""Gassy"" Jack Deighton in 1867 on the edge of the Hastings Mill property.In 1870, the colonial government surveyed the settlement and laid out a townsite, renamed ""Granville"" in honour of the then-British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Granville. This site, with its natural harbour, was selected in 1884 as the terminus for the Canadian Pacific Railway, to the disappointment of Port Moody, New Westminster and Victoria, all of which had vied to be the railhead. A railway was among the inducements for British Columbia to join the Confederation in 1871 but the Pacific Scandal and arguments over the use of Chinese labour delayed construction until the 1880s.


=== Incorporation ===

The City of Vancouver was incorporated on April 6, 1886, the same year that the first transcontinental train arrived. CPR president William Van Horne arrived in Port Moody to establish the CPR terminus recommended by Henry John Cambie, and gave the city its name in honour of George Vancouver. The Great Vancouver Fire on June 13, 1886, razed the entire city. The Vancouver Fire Department was established that year and the city quickly rebuilt. Vancouver's population grew from a settlement of 1,000 people in 1881 to over 20,000 by the turn of the century and 100,000 by 1911.Vancouver merchants outfitted prospectors bound for the Klondike Gold Rush in 1898. One of those merchants, Charles Woodward, had opened the first Woodward's store at Abbott and Cordova Streets in 1892 and, along with Spencer's and the Hudson's Bay department stores, formed the core of the city's retail sector for decades.The economy of early Vancouver was dominated by large companies such as the CPR, which fuelled economic activity and led to the rapid development of the new city; in fact, the CPR was the main real estate owner and housing developer in the city. While some manufacturing did develop, including the establishment of the British Columbia Sugar Refinery by Benjamin Tingley Rogers in 1890, natural resources became the basis for Vancouver's economy. The resource sector was initially based on logging and later on exports moving through the seaport, where commercial traffic constituted the largest economic sector in Vancouver by the 1930s.


=== Twentieth century ===

The dominance of the economy by big business was accompanied by an often militant labour movement. The first major sympathy strike was in 1903 when railway employees struck against the CPR for union recognition. Labour leader Frank Rogers was killed by CPR police while picketing at the docks, becoming the movement's first martyr in British Columbia. The rise of industrial tensions throughout the province led to Canada's first general strike in 1918, at the Cumberland coal mines on Vancouver Island. Following a lull in the 1920s, the strike wave peaked in 1935 when unemployed men flooded the city to protest conditions in the relief camps run by the military in remote areas throughout the province. After two tense months of daily and disruptive protesting, the relief camp strikers decided to take their grievances to the federal government and embarked on the On-to-Ottawa Trek, but their protest was put down by force. The workers were arrested near Mission and interned in work camps for the duration of the Depression.Other social movements, such as the first-wave feminist, moral reform, and temperance movements were also instrumental in Vancouver's development. Mary Ellen Smith, a Vancouver suffragist and prohibitionist, became the first woman elected to a provincial legislature in Canada in 1918. Alcohol prohibition began in the First World War and lasted until 1921, when the provincial government established control over alcohol sales, a practice still in place today. Canada's first drug law came about following an inquiry conducted by the federal minister of Labour and future prime minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King. King was sent to investigate damages claims resulting from a riot when the Asiatic Exclusion League led a rampage through Chinatown and Japantown. Two of the claimants were opium manufacturers, and after further investigation, King found that white women were reportedly frequenting opium dens as well as Chinese men. A federal law banning the manufacture, sale, and importation of opium for non-medicinal purposes was soon passed based on these revelations. These riots, and the formation of the Asiatic Exclusion League, also act as signs of a growing fear and mistrust towards the Japanese living in Vancouver and throughout BC. These fears were exacerbated by the attack on Pearl Harbor leading to the eventual internment or deportation of all Japanese-Canadians living in the city and the province. After the war, these Japanese-Canadian men and women were not allowed to return to cities like Vancouver causing areas, like the aforementioned Japantown, to cease to be ethnically Japanese areas as the communities never revived.Amalgamation with Point Grey and South Vancouver gave the city its final boundaries not long before it became the third-largest metropolis in the country. As of January 1, 1929, the population of the enlarged Vancouver was 228,193.


== Geography ==

Located on the Burrard Peninsula, Vancouver lies between Burrard Inlet to the north and the Fraser River to the south. The Strait of Georgia, to the west, is shielded from the Pacific Ocean by Vancouver Island. The city has an area of 114 km2 (44 sq mi), including both flat and hilly ground and is in the Pacific Time Zone (UTC−8) and the Pacific Maritime Ecozone.Until the city's naming in 1885, ""Vancouver"" referred to Vancouver Island and it remains a common misconception that the city is located on the island. The island and the city are both named after Royal Navy Captain George Vancouver (as is the city of Vancouver, Washington, in the United States).
Vancouver has one of the largest urban parks in North America, Stanley Park, which covers 404.9 ha (1,001 acres). The North Shore Mountains dominate the cityscape, and on a clear day, scenic vistas include the snow-capped volcano Mount Baker in the state of Washington to the southeast, Vancouver Island across the Strait of Georgia to the west and southwest, and Bowen Island to the northwest.


=== Ecology ===
The vegetation in the Vancouver area was originally temperate rain forest, consisting of conifers with scattered pockets of maple and alder and large areas of swampland (even in upland areas, due to poor drainage). The conifers were a typical coastal British Columbia mix of Douglas fir, western red cedar and western hemlock. The area is thought to have had the largest trees of these species on the British Columbia Coast. Only in Elliott Bay, Seattle, did the size of trees rival those of Burrard Inlet and English Bay. The largest trees in Vancouver's old-growth forest were in the Gastown area, where the first logging occurred and on the southern slopes of False Creek and English Bay, especially around Jericho Beach. The forest in Stanley Park was logged between the 1860s and 1880s and evidence of old-fashioned logging techniques such as springboard notches can still be seen there.Many plants and trees growing throughout Vancouver and the Lower Mainland were imported from other parts of the continent and from points across the Pacific. Examples include the monkey puzzle tree, the Japanese maple and various flowering exotics, such as magnolias, azaleas  and rhododendrons. Some species imported from harsher climates in Eastern Canada or Europe have grown to immense sizes. The native Douglas maple can also attain a tremendous size. Many of the city's streets are lined with flowering varieties of Japanese cherry trees donated from the 1930s onward by the government of Japan. These flower for several weeks in early spring each year, an occasion celebrated by the Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival. Other streets are lined with flowering chestnut, horse chestnut and other decorative shade trees.


=== Climate ===

Vancouver is one of Canada's warmest cities in the winter. Vancouver's climate is temperate by Canadian standards and is classified as oceanic or marine west coast, (Köppen climate classification Cfb) that borders on a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb). While during summer months the inland temperatures are significantly higher, Vancouver has the coolest summer average high of all major Canadian metropolitan areas. The summer months are typically dry, with an average of only one in five days during July and August receiving precipitation. In contrast, the majority of days from November through March record some type of precipitation.Vancouver is also one of the wettest Canadian cities. However, precipitation varies throughout the metropolitan area. Annual precipitation as measured at Vancouver International Airport in Richmond averages 1,189 mm (46.8 in), compared with 1,588 mm (62.5 in) in the downtown area and 2,044 mm (80.5 in) in North Vancouver. The daily maximum averages 22 °C (72 °F) in July and August, with highs rarely reaching 30 °C (86 °F).The highest temperature ever recorded at the airport was 34.4 °C (93.9 °F) set on July 30, 2009, and the highest temperature ever recorded within the city of Vancouver was 35.0 °C (95.0 °F) occurring first on July 31, 1965, again on August 8, 1981, and finally on May 29, 1983. The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city was −17.8 °C (0.0 °F) on January 14, 1950 and again on December 29, 1968.On average, snow falls on nine days per year, with three days receiving 5 cm (2.0 in) or more. Average yearly snowfall is 38.1 cm (15.0 in) but typically does not remain on the ground for long.Winters in Greater Vancouver are the fourth-mildest of Canadian cities after nearby Victoria, Nanaimo and Duncan, all on Vancouver Island. Vancouver's growing season averages 237 days, from March 18 until November 10. Vancouver's 1981–2010 USDA Plant Hardiness Zone ranges from 8A to 9A depending on elevation and proximity to water.


== Cityscape ==


=== Urban planning ===

As of 2011, Vancouver is the most densely populated city in Canada. Urban planning in Vancouver is characterized by high-rise residential and mixed-use development in urban centres, as an alternative to sprawl. As part of the larger Metro Vancouver region, it is influenced by the policy direction of livability as illustrated in Metro Vancouver's Regional Growth Strategy.
Vancouver has been ranked one of the most livable cities in the world for more than a decade. As of 2019, Vancouver has been ranked as having the third-highest quality of living of any city on Earth. In contrast, according to Forbes, Vancouver had the fourth-most expensive real estate market in the world in 2019. Vancouver has also been ranked among Canada's most expensive cities to live in. Sales in February 2016 were 56.3% higher than the 10-year average for the month. Forbes also ranked Vancouver as the tenth-cleanest city in the world in 2007.Vancouver's characteristic approach to urban planning originated in the late 1950s, when city planners began to encourage the building of high-rise residential towers in Vancouver's West End, subject to strict requirements for setbacks and open space to protect sight lines and preserve green space. The success of these dense but liveable neighbourhoods led to the redevelopment of urban industrial sites, such as North False Creek and Coal Harbour, beginning in the mid-1980s. The result is a compact urban core that has gained international recognition for its ""high amenity and 'livable' development"". In 2006, the city launched a planning initiative entitled EcoDensity, with the stated goal of exploring ways in which ""density, design, and land use can contribute to environmental sustainability, affordability, and livability"".


=== Architecture ===

The Vancouver Art Gallery is housed downtown in the neoclassical former courthouse built in 1906. The courthouse building was designed by Francis Rattenbury, who also designed the British Columbia Parliament Buildings and the Empress Hotel in Victoria, and the lavishly decorated second Hotel Vancouver. The 556-room Hotel Vancouver, opened in 1939 and the third by that name, is across the street with its copper roof. The Gothic-style Christ Church Cathedral, across from the hotel, opened in 1894 and was declared a heritage building in 1976.
There are several modern buildings in the downtown area, including the Harbour Centre, the Vancouver Law Courts and surrounding plaza known as Robson Square (designed by Arthur Erickson) and the Vancouver Library Square (designed by Moshe Safdie and DA Architects), reminiscent of the Colosseum in Rome, and the recently completed Woodward's building Redevelopment (designed by Henriquez Partners Architects).
The original BC Hydro headquarters building (designed by Ron Thom and Ned Pratt) at Nelson and Burrard Streets is a modernist high-rise, now converted into the Electra condominia. Also notable is the ""concrete waffle"" of the MacMillan Bloedel building on the north-east corner of the Georgia and Thurlow intersection.

A prominent addition to the city's landscape is the giant tent-frame Canada Place (designed by Zeidler Roberts Partnership Partnership, MCMP & DA Architects), the former Canada Pavilion from the 1986 World Exposition, which includes part of the Convention Centre, the Pan-Pacific Hotel, and a cruise ship terminal. Two modern buildings that define the southern skyline away from the downtown area are City Hall and the Centennial Pavilion of Vancouver General Hospital, both designed by Townley and Matheson in 1936 and 1958, respectively.A collection of Edwardian buildings in the city's old downtown core were, in their day, the tallest commercial buildings in the British Empire. These were, in succession, the Carter-Cotton Building (former home of The Vancouver Province newspaper), the Dominion Building (1907) and the Sun Tower (1911), the former two at Cambie and Hastings Streets and the latter at Beatty and Pender Streets.

The Sun Tower's cupola was finally exceeded as the Empire's tallest commercial building by the elaborate Art Deco Marine Building in the 1920s. The Marine Building is known for its elaborate ceramic tile facings and brass-gilt doors and elevators, which make it a favourite location for movie shoots. Topping the list of tallest buildings in Vancouver is Living Shangri-La at 201 m (659 ft) and 62 storeys. The second-tallest building in Vancouver is the Trump International Hotel and Tower at 188 m (617 ft), followed by the Private Residences at Hotel Georgia, at 156 m (512 ft). The fourth-tallest is One Wall Centre at 150 m (490 ft) and 48 storeys, followed closely by the Shaw Tower at 149 m (489 ft).


== Demographics ==

The 2016 census recorded more than 631,000 people in the city, making it the eighth-largest among Canadian cities. More specifically, Vancouver is the fourth-largest in Western Canada after Calgary, Edmonton and Winnipeg. The metropolitan area referred to as Greater Vancouver, with more than 2.4 million residents, is the third-most populous metropolitan area in the country and the most populous in Western Canada. The larger Lower Mainland-Southwest economic region (which includes also the Squamish-Lillooet, Fraser Valley, and Sunshine Coast Regional District) has a population of over 2.93 million. With 5,249 people per square km (13,590 per sq mi), the City of Vancouver is the most densely populated of Canadian municipalities having more than 5,000 residents. Approximately 74 percent of the people living in Metro Vancouver live outside the city.
Vancouver has been called a ""city of neighbourhoods"". Each neighbourhood in Vancouver has a distinct character and ethnic mix. People of English, Scottish, and Irish origins were historically the largest ethnic groups in the city, and elements of British society and culture are still visible in some areas, particularly South Granville and Kerrisdale. Germans are the next-largest European ethnic group in Vancouver and were a leading force in the city's society and economy until the rise of anti-German sentiment with the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Today the Chinese are the largest visible ethnic group in the city, with a diverse Chinese-speaking community, and several dialects, including Cantonese and Mandarin. Neighbourhoods with distinct ethnic commercial areas include Chinatown, Punjabi Market, Little Italy, Greektown, and (formerly) Japantown.
Since the 1980s, immigration increased substantially, making the city more ethnically and linguistically diverse; 53% of Vancouver's residents do not speak English as their first language. Almost 30% of the city's inhabitants are of Chinese heritage. In the 1980s, an influx of immigrants from Hong Kong in anticipation of the transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to China, combined with an increase in immigrants from mainland China and previous immigrants from Taiwan, established in Vancouver one of the highest concentrations of ethnic Chinese residents in North America. This arrival of Asian immigrants continued a tradition of immigration from around the world that had established Vancouver as the second-most popular destination for immigrants in Canada after Toronto. Other significant Asian ethnic groups in Vancouver include South Asians (6.0%), Filipinos (5.9%), Japanese (1.7%), Korean (1.5%), West Asians (1.4%), as well as sizeable communities of Vietnamese, Indonesians, and Cambodians. Despite increases in Latin American immigration to Vancouver in the 1980s and 1990s, recent immigration has been comparatively low, and African immigration has been similarly stagnant (3.6% and 3.3% of total immigrant population, respectively). The black population of Vancouver is rather scant in comparison to other Canadian major cities, making up 0.9% of the city. Hogan's Alley, a small area adjacent to Chinatown, just off Main Street at Prior, was once home to a significant black community. The neighbourhood of Strathcona was the core of the city's Jewish community. In 1981, less than 7% of the population belonged to a visible minority group. By 2016, this proportion had grown to 52%.Prior to the Hong Kong diaspora of the 1990s, the largest non-British ethnic groups in the city were Irish and German, followed by Scandinavian, Italian, Ukrainian and Chinese. From the mid-1950s until the 1980s, many Portuguese immigrants came to Vancouver and the city had the third-largest Portuguese population in Canada in 2001. Eastern Europeans, including Russians, Czechs, Poles, Romanians and Hungarians began immigrating after the Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe after World War II. Greek immigration increased in the late 1960s and early '70s, with most settling in the Kitsilano area. Vancouver also has a significant aboriginal community of about 11,000 people.Vancouver has a large LGBT community, with a recognized gay enclave focused in the West End neighbourhood of the downtown core, particularly along Davie Street, officially designated as Davie Village, though the gay community is omnipresent throughout West End and Yaletown areas. Vancouver is host to one of the country's largest annual LGBT pride parades.


== Economy ==

With its location on the Pacific Rim and at the western terminus of Canada's transcontinental highway and rail routes, Vancouver is one of the nation's largest industrial centres. Port Metro Vancouver, Canada's largest and most diversified port, does more than C$172 billion in trade with over 160 different trading economies annually. Port activities generate $9.7 billion in gross domestic product and $20.3 billion in economic output. Vancouver is also the headquarters of forest product and mining companies. In recent years, Vancouver has become a centre for software development, biotechnology, aerospace, video game development, animation studios and television production and film industry. Vancouver hosts approximately 65 movies and 55 TV series annually and is the 3rd largest film & TV production centre in North America, supporting 20,000 jobs. The city's strong focus on lifestyle and health culture also makes it a hub for many lifestyle brands with Lululemon, Arc'teryx, Kit and Ace, Mountain Equipment Co-op, Herschel Supply Co., Aritzia, Reigning Champ, and Nature's Path Foods all founded and headquartered in Vancouver. Vancouver was also the birthplace of 1-800-GOT-JUNK? and Western Canada's largest online-only publication, Daily Hive.

Vancouver's scenic location makes it a major tourist destination. Over 10.3 million people visited Vancouver in 2017. Annually, tourism contributes approximately $4.8 billion to the Metro Vancouver economy and supports over 70,000 jobs. Many visit to see the city's gardens, Stanley Park, Queen Elizabeth Park, VanDusen Botanical Garden and the mountains, ocean, forest and parklands which surround the city. Each year over a million people pass through Vancouver on cruise ship vacations, often bound for Alaska.Vancouver is the most stressed city in the spectrum of affordability of housing in Canada. In 2012, Vancouver was ranked by Demographia as the second-most unaffordable city in the world, rated as even more severely unaffordable in 2012 than in 2011. The city has adopted various strategies to reduce housing costs, including cooperative housing, legalized secondary suites, increased density and smart growth. As of April 2010, the average two-level home in Vancouver sold for a record high of $987,500, compared with the Canadian average of $365,141. A factor explaining the high property prices may be policies by the Canadian government which permit snow washing, which allows foreigners to buy property in Canada while shielding their identities from tax authorities, making real estate transactions an effective way to conduct money laundering.Since the 1990s, development of high-rise condominia in the downtown peninsula has been financed, in part, by an inflow of capital from Hong Kong immigrants due to the former colony's 1997 handover to China. Such development has clustered in the Yaletown and Coal Harbour districts and around many of the SkyTrain stations to the east of the downtown. The city's selection to co-host the 2010 Winter Olympics was also a major influence on economic development. Concern was expressed that Vancouver's increasing homelessness problem would be exacerbated by the Olympics because owners of single room occupancy hotels, which house many of the city's lowest income residents, converted their properties to attract higher income residents and tourists. Another significant international event held in Vancouver, the 1986 World Exposition, received over 20 million visitors and added $3.7 billion to the Canadian economy. Some still-standing Vancouver landmarks, including the SkyTrain public transit system and Canada Place, were built as part of the exposition.


== Government ==

Vancouver, unlike other British Columbia municipalities, is incorporated under the Vancouver Charter. The legislation, passed in 1953, supersedes the Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921 and grants the city more and different powers than other communities possess under BC's Municipalities Act.
The civic government was dominated by the centre-right Non-Partisan Association (NPA) since World War II, albeit with some significant centre-left interludes until 2008. The NPA fractured over the issue of drug policy in 2002, facilitating a landslide victory for the Coalition of Progressive Electors (COPE) on a harm reduction platform. Subsequently, North America's only legal safe injection site was opened for the significant number of intravenous heroin users in the city.Vancouver is governed by the eleven-member Vancouver City Council, a nine-member School Board, and a seven-member Park Board, all of whom serve four-year terms. Unusually for a city of Vancouver's size, all municipal elections are on an at-large basis. Historically, in all levels of government, the more affluent west side of Vancouver has voted along conservative or liberal lines while the eastern side of the city has voted along left-wing lines. This was reaffirmed with the results of the 2005 provincial election and the 2006 federal election.

Though polarized, a political consensus has emerged in Vancouver around a number of issues. Protection of urban parks, a focus on the development of rapid transit as opposed to a freeway system, a harm-reduction approach to illegal drug use, and a general concern about community-based development are examples of policies that have come to have broad support across the political spectrum in Vancouver.In the 2008 Municipal Election campaign, NPA incumbent mayor Sam Sullivan was ousted as mayoral candidate by the party in a close vote, which instated Peter Ladner as the new mayoral candidate for the NPA. Gregor Robertson, a former MLA for Vancouver-Fairview and head of Happy Planet, was the mayoral candidate for Vision Vancouver, the other main contender. Vision Vancouver candidate Gregor Robertson defeated Ladner by a considerable margin, nearing 20,000 votes. The balance of power was significantly shifted to Vision Vancouver, which held seven of the 10 spots for councillor. Of the remaining three, COPE received two and the NPA one. For park commissioner, four spots went to Vision Vancouver, one to the Green Party, one to COPE, and one to NPA. For school trustee, there were four Vision Vancouver seats, three COPE seats, and two NPA seats. In the 2018 Vancouver municipal election, independent Kennedy Stewart was elected mayor of Vancouver.Vancouver's budget consists of a capital and an operating component. The 2017 operating budget was $1.323 billion, while the 2018 operating budget is $1.407 billion (a year over year increase of 6.4%). The capital budget for 2018 is unchanged from 2017 and stands at $426.4 million. Budget increases are largely funded through increases in property taxes and community amenity contributions imposed in exchange for increases in allowable density as part of the construction permitting process. Utility fees and other user fees have also been increased, but represent a comparatively small portion of Vancouver's overall budget.


=== Regional government ===

Vancouver is a member municipality of Metro Vancouver, a regional government. In total there are 22 municipalities, one electoral area and one treaty First Nation comprising Metro Vancouver, the regional government whose seat is in Burnaby. While each member of Metro Vancouver has its own separate local governing body, Metro Vancouver oversees common services and planning functions within the area such as providing drinking water; operating sewage and solid waste handling; maintaining regional parks; overseeing air quality, greenhouse gases and ecological health; and providing a strategy for regional growth and land use.


=== Provincial and federal representation ===
In the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, Vancouver is represented by 11 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). As of July 2017, there are three seats held by the BC Liberal Party and eight by the BC New Democratic Party.In the House of Commons of Canada, Vancouver is represented by six members of Parliament. In the most recent 2015 federal election, the Liberals retained two (Vancouver Quadra and Vancouver Centre) seats and gained another two, while the NDP held on to the two seats (Vancouver East and Vancouver Kingsway), they held at dissolution while the Conservatives were shut out of the city. One current Cabinet minister hails from the city – Vancouver South MP Harjit Sajjan is Minister of National Defence.


=== Policing and crime ===

Vancouver operates the Vancouver Police Department, with 1,327 sworn members and an operating budget of $316.5 million in 2018. Over 19% of the city's budget was spent on police protection in 2018.The Vancouver Police Department's operational divisions include a bicycle squad, a marine squad, and a dog squad. It also has a mounted squad, used primarily to patrol Stanley Park and occasionally the Downtown Eastside and West End, as well as for crowd control. The police work in conjunction with civilian and volunteer run Community Police Centres. In 2006, the police department established its own Counter Terrorism Unit. In 2005, a new transit police force, the Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority Police Service (now South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service), was established with full police powers.
Before the legalization of marijuana, Vancouver police generally did not arrest people for possessing small amounts of marijuana. In 2000 the Vancouver Police Department established a specialized drug squad, ""Growbusters"", to carry out an aggressive campaign against the city's estimated 4,000 hydroponic marijuana growing operations (or grow-ops) in residential areas. As with other law enforcement campaigns targeting marijuana this initiative has been sharply criticized.

As of 2018, Vancouver had the ninth-highest crime rate, dropping 5 spots since 2005, among Canada's 35 census metropolitan areas. However, as with other Canadian cities, the overall crime rate has been falling ""dramatically"". The rate of firearm related violence dropped from 45.3 per 100,000 in 2006, the highest of any major metropolitan region in Canada at that time, to 16.2 in 2017. A series of gang-related incidents in early 2009 escalated into what police have dubbed a gang war. Vancouver plays host to special events such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, the Clinton-Yeltsin Summit, or the Symphony of Fire fireworks show that require significant policing. The 1994 Stanley Cup riot overwhelmed police and injured as many as 200 people. A second riot took place following the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals.Many streets in Downtown Vancouver are plagued with litter and discarded hypodermic needles from the city's homeless population, which in 2019 was estimated at 2,223. To reduce the public health risk from discarded hypodermic needles, the city runs a continuous collection effort, recovering approximately 1000 needles per day from public spaces. According to Vancouver Coastal Health, the regional health authority and a distributor of clean needles to intravenous drug users, there has never been a documented case of disease transmission from an accidental needlestick.


=== Military ===
Jericho Beach in Vancouver is the location of the headquarters of 39 Canadian Brigade Group of the Canadian Army. Local primary reserve units include The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada and The British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught's Own), based at the Seaforth Armoury and the Beatty Street Drill Hall, respectively, and the 15th Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery. The Naval Reserve Unit HMCS Discovery is based on Deadman's Island in Stanley Park. RCAF Station Jericho Beach, the first air base in Western Canada, was taken over by the Canadian Army in 1947 when sea planes were replaced by long-range aircraft. Most of the base facilities were transferred to the City of Vancouver in 1969 and the area renamed ""Jericho Park"".


== Education ==

The Vancouver School Board enrolls more than 110,000 students in its elementary, secondary, and post-secondary institutions, making it the second-largest school district in the province. The district administers about 76 elementary schools, 17 elementary annexes, 18 secondary schools, 7 adult education centres, 2 Vancouver Learning Network schools, which include 18 French immersion, a Mandarin bilingual, a fine arts, gifted, and Montessori schools. The Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique operates three Francophone schools in that city: the primary schools école Rose-des-vents and école Anne-Hébert as well as the école secondaire Jules-Verne. More than 46 independent schools of a wide variety are also eligible for partial provincial funding and educate approximately 10% of pupils in the city.There are five public universities in the Greater Vancouver area, the largest being the University of British Columbia (UBC) and Simon Fraser University (SFU), with a combined enrolment of more than 90,000 undergraduates, graduates, and professional students in 2008. UBC often ranks among the 40 best universities in the world and is among the 20 best public universities. SFU consistently ranks as the top comprehensive university in Canada and is among the 200 best universities in the world. UBC's main campus is located on the tip of Burrard Peninsula, just west of the University Endowment Lands with the city-proper adjacent to the east. SFU's main campus is in Burnaby. Both also maintain campuses in Downtown Vancouver and Surrey.
The other public universities in the metropolitan area around Vancouver are Capilano University in North Vancouver, Emily Carr University of Art and Design, and Kwantlen Polytechnic University whose four campuses are all outside the city proper. Six private institutions also operate in the region: Trinity Western University in Langley, UOPX Canada in Burnaby, and University Canada West, NYIT Canada, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Columbia College, and Sprott Shaw College, all in Vancouver.
Vancouver Community College and Langara College are publicly funded college-level institutions in Vancouver, as is Douglas College with three campuses outside the city. The British Columbia Institute of Technology in Burnaby provides polytechnic education. These are augmented by private and vocational institutions and other colleges in the surrounding areas of Metro Vancouver that provide career, trade, and university-transfer programs, while the Vancouver Film School provides one-year programs in film production and video game design.International students and English as a Second Language (ESL) students have been significant in the enrolment of these public and private institutions. For the 2008–2009 school year, 53% of Vancouver School Board's students spoke a language other than English at home.


== Arts and culture ==


=== Theatre, dance, film and television ===


==== Theatre ====
Prominent theatre companies in Vancouver include the Arts Club Theatre Company on Granville Island, and Bard on the Beach. Smaller companies include Touchstone Theatre, and Studio 58. The Cultch, The Firehall Arts Centre, United Players, Pacific and Metro Theatres, all run continuous theatre seasons. Theatre Under the Stars produces shows in the summer at Malkin Bowl in Stanley Park.

The Scotiabank Dance Centre, a converted bank building on the corner of Davie and Granville, functions as a gathering place and performance venue for Vancouver-based dancers and choreographers. Dances for a Small Stage is a semi-annual dance festival.


==== Film ====
The Vancouver International Film Festival, which runs for two weeks each September, shows over 350 films and is one of the larger film festivals in North America. The Vancouver International Film Centre venue, the Vancity Theatre, runs independent non-commercial films throughout the rest of the year, as do the Pacific Cinémathèque, and the Rio theatres.


===== Films set in Vancouver =====

Vancouver has become a major film location, known as Hollywood North, as it has stood in for several U.S. cities. However, it has started to appear as itself in several feature films. Among films set in the city and its surroundings are the 1994 US thriller Intersection, starring Richard Gere and Sharon Stone; the 2007 Canadian ghost thriller They Wait, starring Terry Chen and Jaime King; and the acclaimed Canadian 'mockumentary' Hard Core Logo, and was named the second-best Canadian film of the last 15 years, in a 2001 poll of 200 industry voters, performed by Playback. Genie Award-winning filmmaker Mina Shum has filmed and set several of her internationally released features in Vancouver, including the Sundance-screened Long Life, Happiness & Prosperity (2002).


==== Television shows produced in Vancouver ====
Many past and current TV shows have been filmed and set in Vancouver. The first Canadian prime time national series to be produced out of Vancouver was Cold Squad and its storyline was also physically set in the city. Other series set in or around the city of Vancouver include Continuum, Da Vinci's Inquest, Danger Bay, Edgemont, Godiva's, Intelligence, Motive, Northwood, Primeval: New World, Robson Arms, The Romeo Section, Shattered, The Switch, and These Arms of Mine.

=== Libraries and museums ===

Libraries in Vancouver include the Vancouver Public Library with its main branch at Library Square, designed by Moshe Safdie. The central branch contains 1.5 million volumes. Altogether there are twenty-two branches containing 2.25 million volumes. The Vancouver Tool Library is Canada's original tool lending library.
The Vancouver Art Gallery has a permanent collection of nearly 10,000 items and is the home of a significant number of works by Emily Carr. However, little or none of the permanent collection is ever on view. Downtown is also home to the Contemporary Art Gallery (Vancouver), which showcases temporary exhibitions by up-and-coming Vancouver artists. The Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery with a small collection of contemporary works is part of the University of British Columbia.
In the Kitsilano district are the Vancouver Maritime Museum, the H. R. MacMillan Space Centre, and the Vancouver Museum, the largest civic museum in Canada. The Museum of Anthropology at UBC is a leading museum of Pacific Northwest Coast First Nations culture. A more interactive museum is Science World at the head of False Creek. The city also features a diverse collection of Public Art.


=== Visual art ===

The Vancouver School of conceptual photography (often referred to as photoconceptualism) is a term applied to a grouping of artists from Vancouver who achieved international recognition starting in the 1980s. No formal ""school"" exists and the grouping remains both informal and often controversial even among the artists themselves, who often resist the term. Artists associated with the term include Jeff Wall, Ian Wallace, Ken Lum, Roy Arden, Stan Douglas and Rodney Graham.Vancouver has a history of Aboriginal art. Examples of this can be seen at the Museum of Anthropology


=== Music and nightlife ===

Musical contributions from Vancouver include performers of classical, folk and popular music. The Vancouver Symphony Orchestra is the professional orchestra based in the city. The Vancouver Opera is a major opera company in the city, and City Opera of Vancouver is the city's professional chamber opera company. The city is home to a number of Canadian composers including Rodney Sharman, Jeffrey Ryan, and Jocelyn Morlock.

The city produced a number of notable punk rock bands, including D.O.A. Other early Vancouver punk bands included the Subhumans, the Young Canadians, the Pointed Sticks, and U-J3RK5. When alternative rock became popular in the 1990s, several Vancouver groups rose to prominence, including 54-40, Odds, Moist, the Matthew Good Band, Sons of Freedom and Econoline Crush. Recent successful Vancouver bands include Gob, Marianas Trench, Theory of a Deadman and Stabilo. Today, Vancouver is home to a number of popular independent bands such as The New Pornographers, Japandroids, Destroyer, In Medias Res, Tegan and Sara, and independent labels including Nettwerk and Mint. Vancouver also produced influential metal band Strapping Young Lad and pioneering electro-industrial bands Skinny Puppy, Numb and Front Line Assembly; the latter's Bill Leeb is better known for founding ambient pop super-group Delerium. Other popular musical artists who made their mark from Vancouver include Carly Rae Jepsen, Bryan Adams, Sarah McLachlan, Heart, Prism, Trooper, Chilliwack, Payolas, Moev, Images in Vogue, Michael Bublé, Stef Lang and Spirit of the West.Larger musical performances are usually held at venues such as Rogers Arena, Queen Elizabeth Theatre, BC Place Stadium or the Pacific Coliseum, while smaller acts are held at places such as the Commodore Ballroom, the Orpheum Theatre and the Vogue Theatre. The Vancouver Folk Music Festival and the Vancouver International Jazz Festival showcase music in their respective genres from around the world. Vancouver's Hong Kong Chinese population has produced several Cantopop stars across the Hong Kong entertainment industry. Similarly, various Indo-Canadian artists and actors have a profile in Bollywood or other aspects of India's entertainment industry.
Vancouver has a vibrant nightlife scene, whether it be food and dining, or bars and nightclubs. The Granville Entertainment District has the city's highest concentration of bars and nightclubs with closing times of 3 am, in addition to various after-hours clubs open until late morning on weekends. The street can attract large crowds on weekends and is closed to traffic on such nights. Gastown is also a popular area for nightlife with many upscale restaurants and nightclubs, as well as the Davie Village which is centre to the city's LGBT community.


== Media ==

Vancouver is a centre for film and television production. Nicknamed Hollywood North, a distinction it shares with Toronto, the city has been used as a film making location for nearly a century, beginning with the Edison Manufacturing Company. In 2008 more than 260 productions were filmed in Vancouver. In 2011 Vancouver slipped to fourth place overall at 1.19 billion, although the region still leads Canada in foreign production.A wide mix of local, national, and international newspapers are distributed in the city. The two major English-language daily newspapers are The Vancouver Sun and The Province. Also, there are two national newspapers distributed in the city, including The Globe and Mail, which began publication of a ""national edition"" in BC in 1983 and recently expanded to include a three-page BC news section, and the National Post which centres on national news. Other local newspapers include 24H (a local free daily), the Vancouver franchise of the national free daily Metro, the twice-a-week Vancouver Courier, and the independent newspaper The Georgia Straight. Three Chinese-language daily newspapers, Ming Pao, Sing Tao and World Journal cater to the city's large Cantonese- and Mandarin-speaking population. A number of other local and international papers serve other multicultural groups in the Lower Mainland.

Some of the local television stations include CBC, Citytv, CTV and Global BC. OMNI British Columbia produces daily newscasts in Cantonese, Mandarin, Punjabi and Korean, and weekly newscasts in Tagalog, as well as programs aimed at other cultural groups. Fairchild Group also has two television stations: Fairchild TV and Talentvision, serving Cantonese- and Mandarin-speaking audiences, respectively.
Radio stations with news departments include CBC Radio One, CKNW and News 1130. The Franco-Columbian community is served by Radio-Canada outlets CBUFT-DT channel 26 (Ici Radio-Canada Télé), CBUF-FM 97.7 (Première Chaîne) and CBUX-FM 90.9 (Espace musique). The multilingual South Asian community is served by Spice Radio on 1200 AM established in 2014.Media dominance is a frequently discussed issue in Vancouver as newspapers The Vancouver Sun, The Province, the Vancouver Courier and other local newspapers such as the Surrey Now, the Burnaby Now and the Richmond News, are all owned by Postmedia Network. The concentration of media ownership has spurred alternatives, making Vancouver a centre for independent online media including The Tyee, the Vancouver Observer, and NowPublic, as well as hyperlocal online media, like Daily Hive and Vancouver Is Awesome, which provide coverage of community events and local arts and culture.


== Transportation ==
 

Vancouver's streetcar system began on June 28, 1890, and ran from the (first) Granville Street Bridge to Westminster Avenue (now Main Street and Kingsway). Less than a year later, the Westminster and Vancouver Tramway Company began operating Canada's first interurban line between the two cities (extended to Chilliwack in 1910). Another line (1902), the Vancouver and Lulu Island Railway, was leased by the Canadian Pacific Railway to the British Columbia Electric Railway in 1905 and ran from the Granville Street Bridge to Steveston via Kerrisdale, which encouraged residential neighbourhoods outside the central core to develop. From 1897 the British Columbia Electric Railway (BCER) became the company that operated the urban and interurban rail system, until 1958, when its last vestiges were dismantled in favour of ""trackless"" trolley and gasoline/diesel buses; in that same year the BCER became the core of the newly created, publicly owned BC Hydro. Vancouver currently has the second-largest trolleybus fleet in North America, after San Francisco.

Successive city councils in the 1970s and 1980s prohibited the construction of freeways as part of a long-term plan. As a result, the only major freeway within city limits is Highway 1, which passes through the north-eastern corner of the city. While the number of cars in Vancouver proper has been steadily rising with population growth, the rate of car ownership and the average distance driven by daily commuters have fallen since the early 1990s. Vancouver is the only major Canadian city with these trends. Despite the fact that the journey time per vehicle has increased by one-third and growing traffic mass, there are 7% fewer cars making trips into the downtown core. In 2012, Vancouver had the worst traffic congestion in Canada and the second-highest in North America, behind Los Angeles. As of 2013, Vancouver now has the worst traffic congestion in North America. Residents have been more inclined to live in areas closer to their interests, or use more energy-efficient means of travel, such as mass transit and cycling. This is, in part, the result of a push by city planners for a solution to traffic problems and pro-environment campaigns. Transportation demand management policies have imposed restrictions on drivers making it more difficult and expensive to commute while introducing more benefits for non-drivers.

TransLink is responsible for roads and public transportation within Metro Vancouver (in succession to BC Transit, which had taken over the transit functions of BC Hydro). It provides bus service, including the RapidBus express service, a foot passenger and bicycle ferry service (known as SeaBus), an automated rapid transit service called SkyTrain, and West Coast Express commuter rail. Vancouver's SkyTrain system is currently running on three lines, the Millennium Line, the Expo Line and the Canada Line  with a total of 53 stations as of 2017. Only 20 of these stations are within the City of Vancouver borders, with the remainders in the adjacent suburbs. A number of city's biggest tourist attractions, such as English Bay/ Stanley Park, the Vancouver Aquarium, University of British Columbia with the Museum of Anthropology, and Kitsilano are not connected by this rapid transit system.
Changes are being made to the regional transportation network as part of Translink's 10-Year Transportation Plan. The Canada Line, opened on August 17, 2009, connects Vancouver International Airport and the neighbouring city of Richmond with the existing SkyTrain system. The Evergreen Extension, which opened on December 2, 2016, links the cities of Coquitlam and Port Moody with the SkyTrain system. As of January 2019, plans to extend the SkyTrain Millennium Line west to UBC as a subway under Broadway have been approved and there are plans for capacity upgrades and an extension to the Expo Line. Several road projects will be completed within the next few years, as part of the Provincial Government's Gateway Program.Other modes of transport add to the diversity of options available in Vancouver. Inter-city passenger rail service is operated from Pacific Central Station by Via Rail to points east, Amtrak Cascades to Seattle and Portland, and Rocky Mountaineer rail tour routes. Small passenger ferries operating in False Creek provide commuter service to Granville Island, Downtown Vancouver and Kitsilano. Vancouver has a citywide network of bicycle lanes and routes, which supports an active population of cyclists year-round. Cycling has become Vancouver's fastest-growing mode of transportation. The bicycle-sharing system Mobi was introduced to the city in June 2016.Vancouver is served by Vancouver International Airport (YVR), located on Sea Island in the city of Richmond, immediately south of Vancouver. Vancouver's airport is Canada's second-busiest airport, and the second-largest gateway on the west coast of North America for international passengers. HeliJet and float plane companies operate scheduled air service from Vancouver harbour and YVR south terminal. The city is also served by two BC Ferry terminals. One is to the northwest at Horseshoe Bay (in West Vancouver), and the other is to the south, at Tsawwassen (in Delta).


== Sports and recreation ==

The mild climate of the city and proximity to ocean, mountains, rivers and lakes make the area a popular destination for outdoor recreation. Vancouver has over 1,298 ha (3,210 acres) of parks, of which Stanley Park, at 404 ha (1,000 acres), is the largest. The city has several large beaches, many adjacent to one another, extending from the shoreline of Stanley Park around False Creek to the south side of English Bay, from Kitsilano to the University Endowment Lands, (which also has beaches that are not part of the city proper). The 18 km (11 mi) of beaches include Second and Third Beaches in Stanley Park, English Bay (First Beach), Sunset, Kitsilano Beach, Jericho, Locarno, Spanish Banks, Spanish Banks Extension, Spanish Banks West, and Wreck Beach. There is also a freshwater beach at Trout Lake in John Hendry Park. The coastline provides for many types of water sport, and the city is a popular destination for boating enthusiasts.Within a 20- to 30-minute drive from downtown Vancouver are the North Shore Mountains, with three ski areas: Cypress Mountain, Grouse Mountain, and Mount Seymour. Mountain bikers have created world-renowned trails across the North Shore. The Capilano River, Lynn Creek and Seymour River, also on the North Shore, provide opportunities to whitewater enthusiasts during periods of rain and spring melt, though the canyons of those rivers are more utilized for hiking and swimming than whitewater.Running races include the Vancouver Sun Run (a 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) race) every April; the Vancouver Marathon, held every May; and the Scotiabank Vancouver Half-Marathon held every June. The Grouse Grind is a 2.9-kilometre (1.8 mi) climb up Grouse Mountain open throughout the summer and fall months, including the annual Grouse Grind Mountain Run. Hiking trails include the Baden-Powell Trail, an arduous 42-kilometre-long (26 mi) hike from West Vancouver's Horseshoe Bay to Deep Cove in the District of North Vancouver.

Vancouver is also home to notable cycling races. During most summers since 1973, the Global Relay Gastown Grand Prix has been held on the cobblestone streets of Gastown. This race and the UBC Grand Prix are part of BC Superweek, an annual series of professional cycling races in Metro Vancouver.

== Sustainability ==

The City of Vancouver has taken a number of steps to become a sustainable city. Electricity used in Vancouver is generated using sustainable resources such as hydroelectric power. The city benefits from being located close to the mountains as hydroelectric generating stations provide 93 percent of the electricity by using falling water without emitting any greenhouse gases or polluting the air. The city is also actively working towards becoming a greener city. The City of Vancouver has crafted an action plan of goals it has set to meet by 2020, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, encouraging the growth of green jobs and businesses, requiring green construction, and reducing waste.The Greenest City action plan (GCAP) is a City of Vancouver urban sustainability initiative. Its primary mission is to ensure that Vancouver becomes the greenest city in the world by the year 2020. The GCAP originated based on the 2009 work of the Greenest City Action Team, a committee co-chaired by Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson. The GCAP was approved by Vancouver city council in July 2011.In May 2018, the Zero Waste 2040 Strategy passed Vancouver's city council. The city began work the same year on decreasing the amount of single-use items distributed in the city, and has stated its intention to ban these items in 2021 if businesses don't meet reduction targets. As part of the plan, a ban on plastic straws, polystyrene food packaging and free shopping bags will go into effect during mid-2019.


== Twin towns – sister cities ==
The City of Vancouver was one of the first cities in Canada to enter into an international sister cities arrangement. Special arrangements for cultural, social and economic benefits have been created with these sister cities.

== History ==


=== Precursor ===
On 24 July 1846, the Diocese of Vancouver Island was erected on territory split off from the Apostolic Vicariate of Oregon (based in the US Oregon Territory; now Diocese of Victoria).


=== Oblates of Mary Immaculate years ===
On 14 December 1863, the Apostolic Vicariate of British Columbia was erected on territory split off from the Diocese of Vancouver Island). A French priest, by the name Louis-Joseph D'Herbomez, from the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, became the first Vicar Apostolic of the newly formed territory. He was soon ordained Titular Bishop of Miletopolis in 1864 and served the Catholic community until his death in 1890.
On 2 September 1890, the pre-diocesan Apostolic Vicariate of British Columbia becomes the Diocese of New Westminster. Another Oblate of Mary Immaculate French Bishop, Pierre-Paul Durieu, took over the responsibilities and served the community until his death in 1899.
On July 27, 1894, during his tenure, the US Territory of Alaska was lost in the creation of the Apostolic Prefecture of Alaska.
Another French Bishop, Augustin Dontenwill, took governance of the Diocese of New Westminster in 1899 and served the community until he resigned, to become the Superior General of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, in 1908. Under his tenure the Holy Rosary Church was commissioned.


=== Under the Archdiocese of Victoria ===
In 1903, the Diocese of Vancouver Island was elevated to Archdiocese of Vancouver Island and in 1904, it was renamed as the Archdiocese of Victoria. A German-born bishop, Bertram Orth, was appointed archbishop in 1903 and led the Archdiocese of Victoria and its suffrages until he resigned in 1908.
On 19 September 1908, the Diocese of New Westminster was elevated to the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Vancouver and in October, 1908, the Archdiocese of Victoria was lowered to the Diocese of Victoria. Father Alexander MacDonald, of Nova Scotia, was quickly appointed and ordained Bishop of Victoria.


=== The Canadian bishops ===
For just over one year the Archdiocese of Vancouver had no bishop until Neil McNeil, Bishop of St. George's, Newfoundland, became the first appointed Canadian Archbishop of Vancouver on 19 January 1910. His tenure was short, as he then went on to become the Archbishop of Toronto on 10 April 1912.
August, 1912, Timothy Casey, Bishop of Saint John in America, New Brunswick, becomes the 5th archbishop of Vancouver. In 1914, what is now called World War I broke out, and Archbishop Casey had to battle hard financial times for the archdiocese. Under his governance, Holy Rosary Church became a cathedral. He served his community until his death in October 1931.


=== The ""Iron Duke"" years ===
August 1928, a priest from Saint John, New Brunswick, became coadjutor archbishop of Vancouver, and on 5 October 1931, Bishop William Mark Duke became Archbishop of Vancouver. In his 32 years of service to his community, Archbishop Duke had to deal with the Great Depression of the Dirty Thirties and later World War II. His strict disciplinarian beliefs and financial management of the archdiocese earned him the title “Iron Duke”. The legacy that was left behind when Archbishop William Mark Duke retired in March 1964 is impressive. He helped establish St. Mark's College at the University of British Columbia, 2 Catholic high schools, 1 non-diocese Catholic high school, 22 Catholic elementary schools and 3 Catholic hospitals including many new parishes in the diocese alone.
During his tenure the archbishopric lost territory twice, to establish suffragan sees : on February 22, 1936 the Diocese of Nelson was erected and on December 22, 1945 the Diocese of Kamloops. These new dioceses helped erect a new high school, new elementary schools & parishes.: Lost territory to establish Diocese of Nelson
The bishop of Nelson, Martin Michael Johnston, became Coadjutor Archbishop of Vancouver, in 1954, to assist Archbishop Duke during Duke's last 10 years of governance. Bishop Johnston became Archbishop of Vancouver on 1964 and retired in 1969. During Archbishop Johnston's tenure, the Vicariate of Prince Rupert was elevated to Diocese of Prince George, in 1967.


=== Project Advance years ===
Auxiliary Bishop James Carney became Archbishop of Vancouver in 1969. Carney became the first Vancouver-born bishop to be appointed to the archdiocese. During his tenure Carney saw the need to rebuild many of the parishes, schools and hospitals that were showing their age. Project Advance was introduced into the community that required the parishes to raise funds. These funds went back into the community to help rebuild their parishes & schools and also to build new facilities, like Archbishop Carney Regional Secondary School, which was built in the archbishop's honour after he died in 1990.
It enjoyed a Papal visit from Pope John Paul II in August 1984.


=== Archdiocesan synod ===
The archdiocese concluded a nine-year synod in December 2006.  Lay and religious representatives from every parish, Catholic school, religious community, the local seminary, and Catholic organizations took part, as well as non-Catholic observers who were invited to the process.
Although it formally ran from October 2002 to October 2003, extensive preparation went into the synod as far back as 1998 during the period leading up to the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000. The synod's aim was to bring the Church of Vancouver into the 21st century, from the “maintenance” mode it was in to more of a mission-driven model, as former archbishop emeritus Adam Exner, OMI, put it.
On December 3, 2006, at Holy Rosary Cathedral, Archbishop Raymond Roussin officially declared the synod closed, officially setting in motion the initiatives proposed.
According to the archdiocesan newspaper The B.C. Catholic, the first 20 declarations from the synod were to come into effect almost immediately. ""Among the highlights are initiatives to encourage pastors to delegate more duties to the laity, to promote the faith formation of teachers, to initiate an adult faith formation strategy, to establish an office and vicar for evangelization, and to initiate a support group for priests.""


=== Current Situation ===
The archdiocese is now working in a significant infrastructure upgrade. This includes seismic upgrades to many churches and schools. The Archdiocese of Vancouver is considered to be among the most conservative of Canada.


==== Sex Abuse ====
In 2019, the Archdiocese of Vancouver publicly named nine clergymen who were criminally convicted of sexual abuse or who had civil lawsuits related to abuse settled against them. It was also acknowledged that the archdiocese was aware of 36 sex abuse cases since the 1950s, which involved 26 children. The Archdiocese of Vancouver was the first among Canada's 60 Catholic dioceses to make this information public.In August 2020, a new sex abuse lawsuit was filed against the Archdiocese of Vancouver. The lead plaintiff, identified only by the initials K.S. in the court documents, said the priest in charge of St. Francis of Assisi School, Father Michael Conaghan, sexually assaulted her while she was a student at the school in the '80s. She was around 11 years old at the time of the alleged abuse. Conaghan, who died four days after the lawsuit was filed, was not among the nine clergy listed by the Archiocese in 2019. The lawsuit also alleges the Archdiocese of Vancouver followed marching orders from the Vatican for years on how to bury allegations of abuse within its parishes.

287,"Little Italy, Vancouver","Little Italy in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada is an area in the eastern part of the city, in the Grandview–Woodland neighbourhood, often synonymous with the Commercial Drive area.

Historically this area was an enclave of ethnic Italians and Italian businesses. Today, after a period of steady decline, it is again a multi-cultural, vibrant commercial centre.


== History ==
Prior to the 1930s, most Italian immigrants settled in what is today the Strathcona district; however, by the 1940s and 1950s most Italian immigrants to Vancouver settled in the northern Commercial Drive area, and were widely credited with revitalizing the neighbourhood. Most Italian Canadian businesses and cultural facilities located along Commercial Drive and, since Italians were in the majority in the adjacent residential areas, Little Italy became a true ethnic Italian enclave. By the 1960s, many Italian businesses also sprang up in the Hastings and Nanaimo area, but the cultural core remained on Commercial Drive. Ethnic Italians were very influential in this area from the 1940s until the mid-1970s.
By the mid-1970s, a combination of cultural assimilation, non-Italian immigration, movement to the suburbs, and a schism within the Italian community led to the decline of Italian influence and concentration in Little Italy. Today, the area is again a vibrant cultural and business centre in eastern Vancouver, but after a succession of other immigrant and cultural groups, the Italian influence has greatly diminished.
on April 6, 2016 the Vancouver city Councillors voted unanimously to declare the area as Little Italy after NPA Councillor put forward the motion. A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on June 12 to recognize officially an eight-block stretch of Commercial Drive as Little Italy.


== Italians in Metro Vancouver today ==
Today, there are still many Italian  businesses and cultural organizations in Vancouver, and people of Italian ancestry living in the Greater Vancouver area number about 75,000. However, no particular single area is predominantly Italian in concentration.
Burnaby Heights is not predominantly Italian, but Italian-Canadians have a distinct presence in the neighbourhood. East Hastings Street, between Boundary and Duthie, is another commercial hub for the Italian community. There are many Italian cafes, delis, and restaurants along the street, including stores which import goods from Italy. Two Roman Catholic churches offering masses in Italian, St. Helen's and Holy Cross, are located nearby. Older, first-generation Italians often congregate in nearby Confederation Park to play Bocce.

288,Grandview–Woodland,"Grandview–Woodland, also commonly known as Grandview–Woodlands, is a neighbourhood in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to the east of the downtown area, stretching south from the shores of Burrard Inlet and encompassing portions of the popular Commercial Drive area. It is a mature neighbourhood in Vancouver that is a vibrant mixture of commercial, industrial, single-family and multi-family residential with a rich ethnic history and features.
A central part of the Vancouver area, Grandview–Woodland runs from the south shore of busy Burrard Inlet south to Broadway, one of the city's major east–west roads. The western border of the neighbourhood is Clark Drive, the eastern Nanaimo Street. It is a busy area for transportation, with Hastings Street and First Avenue both cutting through the neighbourhood, while Victoria Drive and Commercial Drive both run north–south through the area.
Much of the neighbourhood is built on the rise that stretches east–west through the eastern portion of Vancouver, making for views across the city proper and the inlet.


== History ==
Local First Nations members have been aware of the Grandview–Woodland area for many years, and referred to the area along Burrard Inlet by the word for cedar trees in their language. A small cove created by a stream running into the inlet became a focal point for early development; the first building was a brewery, followed by sawmills using the forests of the area. The land along Burrard Inlet was valued by speculators after the Gold Rush, and was the location of the Canadian Pacific Railway when it was built in the 1880s. Around that time, the sawmill owners clearcut the entire Grandview–Woodland area, and the construction of the Interurban train line to New Westminster, British Columbia in 1891 spurred the construction of a new community in the area. One legend indicates that the name Grand View was first expressed on a sign hung by a homeowner next to the Interurban stop near the Commercial Drive-1st Avenue intersection.
In 1906, construction started to boom, with homes being built through the neighbourhood, and the railway influencing industrial development along the waterfront. Park Drive became a major commercial route that eventually became Commercial Drive, and people of many ethnic backgrounds made the neighbourhood their home over the years.
Grandview Woodland has been experiencing gentrification since around 2008 as a result of high real estate prices in Vancouver and the heightened popularity of inner-city living.


== Attractions ==
Commercial Drive is perhaps the single most popular part of Grandview–Woodland. A street packed with small shops, it has been a key part of the commercial landscape in Vancouver for nearly a century for its ethnic diversity and the uniqueness of shops that populate it. Known locally as ""The Drive"", visitors find everything from trendy coffee shops to hangouts for many ethnicities (celebrations during the FIFA World Cup can bring out soccer fans of many nationalities, for example) to sex toys to hemp shops. Little Italy focuses on the Drive, though many of its residents have moved to other neighbourhoods over the years.


== Demographics ==
As of 2006, Grandview–Woodland has 28,205 people, a 3% decrease from 2001. 16.1% of the population is under the age of 19; 38.4% is between 20 and 39; 35.1% is between 40 and 64; and 10.4% is 65 or older. 62.0% of Grandview–Woodland residents speak English as a first language, and 14.4% speak a Chinese language. French (2.3%), Spanish (2.3%), Italian (2.3%), and Tagalog (2.1%) are also common first languages. The median household income is $35,342, and 35.2% of its population lives in low-income households. Its unemployment rate is 7.8%.

289,"Greektown, Vancouver","Greektown in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada is an area in the Kitsilano neighborhood that was historically an enclave of Greek immigrants and their descendants. 
The term is an informal one, and Greektown's borders are not strictly defined; however, West Broadway around Trutch Street is generally considered the neighbourhood's heart, while Blenheim St to the west and MacDonald St to the east are approximately its outer limits. Vancouverites of Greek descent, who live in Kitsilano, nostalgically also call the area Ουέστ Μπροντουέι (literally ""West Broadway"").This Greek identity has waned considerably since the area first became a community of exiles during the dictatorship in Greece of the 1960s and early 1970s, and the primary markers of Greektown are St. George's Greek Orthodox Cathedral located at the intersection of Arbutus Street and Valley Drive, the local Athens Social Club, a Greek supermarket, and a higher-than-average concentration of Greek restaurants. There is also a Greek Senior Citizen Society.
St. George's Greek Orthodox Cathedral been noted for its traditional Byzantine Icons. St. George's Hellenic Community of Vancouver (attached to the Cathedral with the same patron saint), holds every year a Greek Food Festival from October 20 to October 22.
The Hellenic Cultural Festival takes place every June in Kitsilano. The highlight is Greek Day, when Broadway is closed to vehicle traffic between MacDonald and Blenheim for free, family-oriented festivities. The festival is part of an ongoing effort to restore the Greek identity of Greektown.


== History ==
After World War II, Greek refugees from Europe and western Canada congregated in the Kitsilano area of Vancouver. They founded the aforementioned Greek Orthodox Cathedral, several businesses and social clubs, schools, a bank, newspapers, and, later, a television station.
In the 1971 Canada census, Greek was the second-most common language and ethnicity in the Kitsilano area (most common was English and the British Isles, respectively). In 1974, the city of Vancouver sanctioned an annual Greek Day celebration in the area.
The current St. George’s Greek Orthodox Cathedral was built in 1974 and its adjacent Hellenic Community Centre was built shortly thereafter in 1977.Originally St. George's Greek Orthodox Cathedral was located at West Seventh and Vine. But between 1954 and 1960 when Vancouver saw such an influx of Greek immigrants that St. George's Hellenic community leaders realized their original church was no longer large enough to accommodate the congregation. The property, today the home of Kitsilano Neighbourhood House, was also not big enough for the construction of a larger church so a new location was proposed.In the 2001 Canada census, the percentage of people in Kitsilano reporting Greek as their mother tongue had shrunk to 2 percent, fewer than those speaking English, Chinese, French, or German.
In 2005 the City of Vancouver, the Government of British Columbia, and the Government of Greece sponsored a return of Greek Day that has continued annually since.

290,Congregation Beth Israel (Vancouver),"Congregation Beth Israel is an egalitarian Conservative synagogue located at 989 West 28th Avenue in Vancouver, British Columbia. It was founded in 1925, but did not formally incorporate until 1932. Its first rabbi was Ben Zion Bokser, hired that year. He was succeeded the following year by Samuel Cass (1933–1941). Other rabbis included David Kogen (1946–1955), Bert Woythaler (1956–1963), and Wilfred Solomon, who served for decades starting in 1964.The congregation worshiped at the Jewish Community Center in Fairview until 1948, when it opened its current building at 4350 Oak Street. By the end of the 1960s, it was the largest Jewish congregation in Vancouver, and by the 1990s, it was Canada's largest Conservative congregation west of Winnipeg. Charles Feinberg was rabbi from 1998 to 2006, and he was succeeded that year by Jonathan Infeld.As of 2010, Beth Israel had over 700 member families. The current rabbi is Jonathan Infeld, and the assistant rabbi is Adam Stein.


== Early history ==
Congregation Beth Israel (Hebrew: בית ישראל‎) was founded in September, 1925, but did not formally incorporate until November, 1932. The incorporation was done in cooperation with the United Synagogue of America (now the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism); at the time, this was unusual in Western Canada, where most synagogues were Orthodox.Previously, the small non-Orthodox Temple Emanu-El—also called the Deutscher Shul (""German synagogue"")—had been formed in Vancouver in 1894 or 1895 as a ""semi-Reform"" congregation – not Orthodox, but more traditional than American Reform congregations. Most Jewish immigrants to Vancouver were, however, Orthodox Yiddish-speakers from Eastern Europe, and Emanu-El's membership did not grow. It lasted until 1910.Beth Israel's founders were second generation, Canadian-born, English-speaking Jews who wanted mixed seating, and an alternative to Vancouver's Orthodox Congregation Schara Tzedeck (founded 1907). Former members of Temple Emanu-El joined with the new congregation, which also took responsibility for a religious school. Once the Jewish Community Center was built in Fairview in 1928, the congregation held its services there.


== Early rabbis and leaders ==

The advertised intent of its first meeting in 1925 was ""to organize a new congregation with an English-speaking Rabbi"". The congregation, however, did not hire its first rabbi, Ben Zion Bokser, until 1932. A 1931 graduate of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS), he had served briefly at the Bronx's Congregation Kehillath Israel before coming to Beth Israel. He left Beth Israel the following year, and moved to the Forest Hills Jewish Center in Queens, New York 1935, where he remained (aside from a brief stint as a U.S. Army chaplain) until his death in 1984.Bokser was succeeded in 1933 by Samuel Cass, who served as Beth Israel's rabbi until 1941. From 1942 to 1946 Cass served as Senior Jewish Chaplain for the Canadian Army and Navy, attaining the rank of Major.Albert O. Koch was one of the congregation's founders. He served as its second president, from 1933 to 1934, and again as its president from 1938 to 1951. Known as the ""father"" of Beth Israel, he was also the founder of the National Dress Company.


== Oak Street building ==
In 1944, the congregation purchased its current synagogue property at 27th and Oak Street, and in 1945 purchased additional land for a cemetery. The cemetery was consecrated in July, 1946.Beth Israel's first building was designed by Toronto architect Harold Solomon Kaplan of Kaplan and Sprachman. The architecture, according to R.W. Liscombe, displayed a ""stylistic simplification of academic and historical motifs"". Erected at 4350 Oak Street near West 27th Avenue, it opened in 1948, and dedicated on September 11, 1949. Its stained-glass windows have been documented by The Institute for Stained Glass in Canada.David C. Kogen, a future vice-chancellor of the JTS, was rabbi from 1946 to 1955 or 1956. He was succeeded by Berthold A. Woythaler, a native of Danzig, in 1956. Woythaler had fled Nazi Germany in 1936, after attending the University of Berlin, and subsequently graduated from the JTS in New York. He served as Beth Israel's rabbi until 1963.Wilfred Solomon joined as rabbi in 1964. He had previously served as the last rabbi of Keneseth Israel Synagogue of Spokane, Washington, before it merged with Spokane's oldest synagogue, Temple Emanu-El, to become Temple Beth Shalom. The following year the synagogue amended its constitution to allow women as members, with voting rights. By the end of the decade, led by Solomon, Beth Israel had 650 member families, and was the largest synagogue in Vancouver.The chapel was refurbished in 1970. In 1970, the synagogue was spray-painted with swastikas, and Elie Wiesel spoke there. By 1978, Beth Israel had 660 member families, and was the largest synagogue in British Columbia. Jeffrey Hoffman served as assistant rabbi from 1981 to 1984.


== Events since 1990 ==
A renovation of the entire synagogue was completed in 1993. Women were given voting rights in 1965, aliyot in the 1980s, and by 1995 the synagogue was fully egalitarian. By 1997, Beth Israel was the largest Jewish congregation in Greater Vancouver, and ""the largest Conservative synagogue [in Canada] west of Winnipeg"".Charles M. Feinberg, who was ordained by the JTS in 1973, was rabbi from 1998 to 2006. In 2002, he was a recipient of the Rabbinic Leadership Award, given by the United Jewish Communities (now the Jewish Federations of North America).Jonathan Infeld succeeded Feinberg in 2006.  A graduate of Brandeis University,  he was ordained by the JTS in 2002. Before joining Beth Israel, he was assistant rabbi of the Marlboro Jewish Center in Marlboro, New Jersey. Mike Zoosman, a 2007 graduate of the JTS's cantorial school, joined as cantor in 2008. That year membership reached 720 families. Cantor Mike Zoosman left Beth Israel to pursue a new career path in 2012 and was replaced by Cantor Lawrence Szenes-Strauss.The building was expanded and largely rebuilt from 2012 to 2014, re-opening on September 14, 2014 just in time for the High Holydays. The architects were Acton/Ostry of Vancouver. The building was completely rebuilt except for part of the foundation and three exterior walls. The front door (and address) are now at 989 West 28th Avenue although the building occupies the same site.As of 2014, Beth Israel has a rapidly growing membership. The rabbi is Rabbi Jonathan Infeld, and the cantor is Cantor Lawrence Szenes-Strauss.

292,South Cambie,"South Cambie is a neighbourhood in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, that is generally considered one of the smallest neighbourhoods in the city, both in size and in population. It is wedged between one of the city's largest parks and the upscale neighbourhood of Shaughnessy, and is known for a large cluster of medical facilities.


== Geography ==
Wedged between Queen Elizabeth Park on the slopes of Vancouver's Little Mountain to the east and the high-priced homes of Shaughnessy on the west, South Cambie is a narrow strip of land encompassing 217 hectares. It is located between the busy north-south corridors of Oak Street and Cambie Street, and stretches from West 16th Avenue in the north to West 41st in the south.
The population of South Cambie was 6,995, according to the 2001 Census; 49.4 percent of respondents listed English as their mother tongue, with Chinese the next largest group at 26.4 percent.


== History ==
A part of a land grant given to the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1800s, Cambie Street was named after CPR engineer Henry Cambie, who was in charge of the railway's western division. The first colonial settlers arrived in 1874 when William Mackie, a former gold miner, claimed 65 hectares of land surrounding a former elk pasture that is now Douglas Park, on West 22nd Avenue. He was followed by Jeremiah Rogers, who became one of the first users of mechanized logging equipment in British Columbia, building a road to the top of Little Mountain. By 1910, that portion of the land had become a Chinese vegetable garden, and homes began to appear around it. Much of the land remained undeveloped until the 1940s.


== Features ==
A number of heritage structures can be found in the South Cambie area, including the 1912 Tudor-style building that houses a Royal Canadian Mounted Police training facility on Heather Street. A number of other heritage homes from the 1910s and 1920s can be found in the northern portion of the neighbourhood.
The South Cambie area includes some of the province's top medical facilities, including BC Children's Hospital and BC Women's Hospital and Health Centre. It was also the site of historic Shaughnessy Hospital, used extensively during World Wars I and II.
The South Cambie area is also home to several educational institutions including Eric Hamber Secondary School, Emily Carr Elementary School, Edith Cavell Elementary School, & French language schools École Rose-des-Vents and École secondaire Jules-Verne,  both operated by Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique.


== Canada Line ==
The Canada Line rapid transit system traverses the entire length of Cambie Street through the South Cambie neighbourhood. The project was completed in August 2009. Possible future platform & station expansions were noted during initial construction, but no plans have yet been made.

293,General Wolfe Elementary School (Vancouver),"General Wolfe Elementary is a public elementary school in Vancouver, British Columbia part of School District 39 Vancouver.


== History ==
General Wolfe Elementary was built in 1910.  One of Wolfe's claims to fame is the boy in ""Wait for Me, Daddy"" photograph (of a boy reaching out towards his father in a line for war). This photo is internationally recognized, and the boy went to school at Wolfe. In 1912, two additional wings were added due to expanding population.  Then in 1920 two wooden temporary buildings were built.  These two buildings are still the annex and the gym today. General Wolfe used to have three portables which were used as classrooms, but when attendance dropped some in 2007, they were all eventually taken away. General Wolfe Elementary was named after General James Wolfe.
Traditionally, the school holds an annual ""Walk-A-Thon"", in which students walk or jog laps around the school to receive prizes, to raise funds. In the 2005-2006 school year, this was canceled for an unknown reason.
General Wolfe also sells magazines for fundraising at the beginning of each year. The Student Council and the PAC (Parent Advisory Council) come up with more fundraisers each year, and what to buy with the money produced.


== Code of Conduct ==
PAWS is the schools code of conduct.

P - Polite
A - Accountable
W - Welcoming
S - Safe


== Sports Teams and Other Clubs ==
General Wolfe has 8 sports programs available, a Junior and Senior Volleyball team, a Junior and Senior Basketball team, Floor Hockey, Badminton and Ultimate Frisbee. General Wolfe also supports a chess club, Junior and Senior choirs, Pop Music Club, and a drama club for the younger students.

299,British Columbia Children's Hospital,"British Columbia Children's Hospital is a medical facility located in Vancouver, British Columbia, and is an agency of the Provincial Health Services Authority. It specializes in health care for patients from birth to 16 + 364 days of age, unless followed by a specialist team. It is also a teaching and research facility for children's medicine. The hospital also operates the Sunny Hill Health Centre for Children, which provides specialized services to children and youth with developmental disabilities aged birth to 19.
The hospital is adjacent to the B.C. Women's Hospital & Health Centre. Previously, the two were officially a single organization and were known as the Children's & Women's Health Centre of British Columbia.Working with the hospital and the community, the BC Children's Hospital Foundation raises funds to support and enhance the delivery of pediatric care in British Columbia. The Foundation provides funding to B.C. Children's Hospital, as well as its sister facilities, the BC Children's Hospital Research Institute and Sunny Hill Health Centre, to support research into childhood diseases, the purchase of medical equipment, and a range of child health education and training programs.


== History ==
B.C. Children's Hospital's roots go back to the establishment of a fund for crippled children by the B.C. Women's Institute in 1923. In 1928, Vancouver's Crippled Children's Hospital admitted its first patient at its Hudson Street location. In 1933, a new Crippled Children's Hospital opened on West 59th Avenue. In 1947, it was renamed Children's Hospital ""to exemplify the growing awareness that children are not defined by their illnesses.""In 1977, ground was broken at the hospital's current location at West 28th Avenue and Oak Street, some time after the Children's Hospital and the Health Centre for Children had agreed to the construction of a joint facility in 1964. Construction was completed in 1982 at a cost of $60 million. The 29,730 square-metre facility housed 250 acute care beds, an adolescent unit, a modern isolation facility, a rehabilitation unit, a 10-bed psychiatric unit and a 60-bed special care nursery.In 1985, the Children's Variety Research Centre opened, showing the increasing importance placed on medical research.In 2002, the Medical Day Unit was expanded from four to twelve beds, providing family-centred care for children with complex medical problems.In 2003, a $28 million expansion saw the opening of a new Ambulatory Care Building, for the increasing numbers of patients not needing to stay overnight. The building tripled the number of clinic rooms available on site for patients and staff, and houses 24 pediatric specialty medical and surgical clinics. The architects state that the building ""is nearly 40% more efficient than the National Energy Code called for when it was built. Sustainable design features include orientation toward solar exposure, maximization of natural ventilation and natural daylight, concourse ventilation, insulated north walls, reduction in electrical power consumption through daylighting, task lighting, and light and occupancy sensors."" The project also involved the nearby B.C. Women's Hospital & Health Centre's new Maternity and Ambulatory Program Clinics, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and the Emergency renovation and expansion.In 2005, two inpatient units were upgraded and modernized in a $6.9-million project. In 2007, the oncology unit was redeveloped and renamed the Djavad Mowafaghian Wing, after its donor provided $6 million for the project.In 2007, a new $19-million Mental Health Building opened. ""It was the first freestanding facility of its kind dedicated to youth mental health in Canada. The modernized 4-story facility serves children and adolescents with serious mental health challenges from all across the province. Services such as emergency care, long term psychiatric care, an outreach program, as well as a significant area for assessment and training are provided"".In 2008, the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) was renovated in a $4.4-million project to enhance family and staff areas and improve the unit's capacity to care for children who require strict isolation. The British Columbia Ministry of Health Services also provided $2.8 million for renovations to the radiology department and new diagnostic equipment, two molecular-imaging gamma cameras: ""One camera is a hybrid SPECT/CT, a gamma camera combined with a six-slice CT scanner that provides overlaid images. These fused images provide physicians with a more accurate picture of what's going on inside patients, enabling more effective treatment. For many patients, it can mean one hospital visit instead of two.""In 2014, construction began on the new Teck Acute Care Centre, a $676 million project in three phases to build ""an eight-storey facility, approximately 59,400 square metres (640,000 square feet) in size. The facility will be designed to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold standard and include extensive use of wood, consistent with the Province of B.C.'s Wood First Act."" The building ""will be a bright, modern facility with single-occupant patient rooms, access to natural light and gardens. It includes medical/surgical inpatient units, an emergency department, medical imaging and procedural suites, a hematology/oncology department and a pediatric intensive care unit for BC Children's Hospital."" On October 29, 2017 The Teck Acute Care Centre, which had been built by Balfour Beatty, was officially opened. Teck Resources Limited earned its name on the new building due to its $25 million donation to BC Children's Hospital Foundation.


== Facilities and amenities ==
B.C. Children's Hospital offers a broad range of inpatient, outpatient and tertiary care for children from birth to adolescence. This includes clinics, emergency services, pediatric health care, surgery, intensive care, transplants, genetics, and an HIV centre.

300,"Shaughnessy, Vancouver","Shaughnessy is an almost-entirely residential neighbourhood in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, spanning about 447 hectares in a relatively central locale. It is bordered by 16th Avenue to the north, 41st Avenue to the south, Oak Street to the east, and East Boulevard to the west. The older section of the neighbourhood, called ""First Shaughnessy,"" is considered more prestigious and is bordered by 16th Avenue to the north, King Edward Avenue to the south, Cambie Street to the east, and East Boulevard to the west. In 2011, the population was approximately 8,807. It was named after Thomas Shaughnessy, 1st Baron Shaughnessy, former president of the Canadian Pacific Railway.
The neighbourhood's residents have an average annual household income of $105,000 ($777,184 in Shaughnessy Heights) and the average house price is $2.89 million, the highest in Vancouver. It is also the site of many historical homes, especially in First Shaughnessy. Of the neighbourhood's homes 51.5% were built before or during World War II, compared with 20.8% for the city at large.  This is largely due to the 1981 First Shaughnessy Official Development Plan by-law, which promotes private property ownership and single-family dwelling, while limiting property subdivision and population density.The neighbourhood was created in 1907 by the Canadian Pacific Railway, the largest real estate developer in Canada. It was meant as an alternative to the West End, which was the traditional home for the budding city's elite. Thanks to aggressive marketing by the railway, highly regulated development, and a stronger degree of exclusiveness, it gradually took the latter's status over the past century. Shaughnessy is known for its elegant tree-lined streets and large properties. In First Shaughnessy, Angus Drive and Osler Street have a tree-lined median in addition to the trees along the edge of the road.

Shaughnessy is home to Little Flower Academy, Vancouver College, and York House School. The public elementary schools are Shaughnessy Elementary and Quilchena Elementary.  There is one public high school in Shaughnessy, Point Grey Secondary. The neighbourhood is in the catchment area of each of Eric Hamber Secondary School, in Oakridge, or Prince of Wales Secondary School, in Arbutus Ridge.
Shaughnessy has five parks, including Shaughnessy Park, formally known as Crescent Park, and Angus Park in First Shaughnessy. The other three parks in Shaughnessy are Devonshire Park, Kerrisdale Park, and VanDusen Botanical Garden, located between 33rd and 41st Avenues. The Arbutus Greenway, purchased by the City of Vancouver from Canadian Pacific Railway, stretches along the western border of Shaughnessy from 41st Avenue to 16th Avenue.

302,Hillcrest Park,"Hillcrest Park is located in the Riley Park-Little Mountain neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia. It is located immediately north of Queen Elizabeth Park and west of Riley Park.
Next to Hillcrest Park is the site containing Nat Bailey Stadium, home of the Vancouver Canadians baseball team; the Millennium Sports Centre, home to both the Phoenix Gymnastics Club and the Pacific Indoor Bowls Club; and the Vancouver Racquets Club.
The little league Little Mountain Baseball has its ballpark and clubhouse in Hillcrest Park. They also use ballparks at Riley Park for the younger age groups. In addition, there are two larger diamonds used by Vancouver Community Baseball. During the soccer season the ballparks are converted to be used as soccer fields by various competitive and recreational leagues.
Hillcrest Park also is home to the Vancouver Curling Club. It had been at the south-west corner of the park in a small building, with only 5 sheets.  With the 2010 Winter Olympics coming to Vancouver the club gained and expanded facility, at the Hillcrest Centre, next door to the Millennium Sports Centre. The new facility houses a new community centre, library, ice rink, curling arena, and the Percy Norman Aquatic Centre. Construction of the arena started in March 2007 and was mostly completed by February 2009. The aquatics portion of the building was completed in spring of 2009, and the final renovations to finish the community centre occurred after the 2010 Winter Games.


== Financial Support ==
The project was made available from all levels of government. Through the Canada-BC Infrastructure Program (CBCIP), administered by Western Economic Diversification Canada, the Government of Canada (GoC) and the Province of BC invested $1.7 million. The Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation provided $250,000, and agreed to lease the land to the Vancouver Millennium Sport Facility Society for $1 per year-an in kind donation equivalent to more than $2 million.

303,Rio Theatre,"The Rio Theatre is an independent, multidisciplinary art house in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Built in 1938, the Rio served East Vancouver primarily as a movie theatre until 2008, when new owners began to add live music and multimedia and multidisciplinary art events.
The Rio seats 420 people, including a balcony section. The projection room houses both a vintage 35-millimetre projector and a 3D digital projector added in 2010. The venue includes a lobby with concession voted best in 2010 and 2011 for single screen theatres in Vancouver, a large stage, and a backstage greenroom for live performers.
Since its evolution in 2008, the Rio has hosted Hollywood blockbusters, local independent filmmakers, midnight screenings of cult classics, the toddler-friendly ""Movies for Mommies"" series, local and international film festivals, comedy festivals, queer film events, burlesque shows, screenings and tours for local public schools, political events, religious services, spoken word and other live performances, and local and international live music.


== Dispute with British Columbia Liquor Control and Licensing Branch ==
According to owner Corinne Lea, the Rio was at risk of business failure under a movies-only model, as indicated by the failure of all but two single-screen theatres in Vancouver by the end of 2011. In 2010, Lea applied for a primary liquor license from the British Columbia Liquor Control and Licensing Branch, in order to attract more live music events where alcohol could be served. When the license was presented to Ms. Lea on January 18, 2012, the LCLB had inserted a condition, unique among any primary liquor license holder in the province, that ""This establishment is not permitted to show movies or any type of cinematic screenings at any time,"" effectively banning The Rio from screening films at any point in the future, regardless of whether alcohol is being served. Lea has said she felt she had no choice but to sign the license or the Rio would need to shut its doors.Response to the LCLB decision has ranged from a Facebook-centred community political action campaign, targeting the LCLB and provincial MLAs to intervene, to national media attention. Proponents involved in assisting the Rio Theatre in the short term, who are also calling on the province of British Columbia to amend its antiquated liquor laws in the long term, include BC MLA Spencer Chandra Herbert, City of Vancouver Councillor Heather Deal, and Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson, among others. There are no known opponents to the newly licensed Rio Theatre also continuing to show unlicensed general-admission movies.In response, the LCLB claimed that it was not able to alter its procedures due to the Regulations of the BC Liquor Control and Licensing Act. The LCLB also stated that it was acting in the interests of ""public safety"" to prevent the possibility of minors consuming alcohol ""in the dark,"" despite the fact that the Rio had agreed to not sell alcohol during general admission film screenings. ON February 9, 2012, the B.C. Government announced that they were making changes to the province's liquor licensing rules to allow venues that serve alcohol to also screen movies, albeit at different times.However, this was not the win they were fighting for, Corinne Lea did not accept these limited restrictions placed on her business. She kept on with her campaign to change the BC liquor laws so that alcohol could be served during movies and live events. The battle took four months in total, while  The Rio Theatre struggled to survive, going severely in debt during this time. In April 2012 the BC Liquor laws were finally changed to allow all movie theatres with a Primary liquor license in BC to serve alcohol during film screenings. Later in January 2013 Corinne Lea was awarded a Diamond Jubilee Governor General award for her successful battle to change the liquor laws.

304,Hillcrest Centre,"The Hillcrest Centre is a community centre with ice hockey and curling rinks, and an aquatics facility, located at Hillcrest Park in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Construction started in March 2007; it hosted the 2009 World Junior Curling Championships prior to the Olympics. During the 2010 Olympics, it was named the Vancouver Olympic/Paralympic Centre and had a capacity of 6,000 people to host curling at the 2010 Winter Olympics; for the 2010 Paralympics, it hosted the Wheelchair Curling event.


== Design ==


=== Sustainability features ===
The centre was built to qualify for the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Scale (LEED) Gold certification; for example, the centre's refrigeration plant is designed to heat other areas of the building and the adjacent aquatic centre through the utilization of what is otherwise waste heat from cooling the ice surface. Surrounding ground water will also be collected for use in the facility's toilets.Smart site selection is key to maintaining the centre's green footprint; the new facility replaces a much older community complex, with the new curling complex being built on what was a gravel parking lot. Federal (CEAA) environmental assessment review process was also applied to the selection of the site. Trees that were affected during the construction of the venue were moved to other areas of the park, and any land created from the demolition of the old community centre will be turned into community green space during post-Games conversion.


=== Aboriginal participation ===
Aboriginal artwork was installed at the venue as part of the Vancouver 2010 Venues Aboriginal Arts Program. Featured art includes traditional, and contemporary artwork by First Nations, Inuit and Metis artists from across Canada.


== Post Olympics ==
After the 2010 Olympic games, the centre was converted into a multi-purpose recreation centre that includes a hockey rink, gymnasium, library, eight sheets of curling ice and a lounge for the curlers. Connected to the facility via an indoor concourse will is the Percy Norman Aquatic Centre, which features a leisure tank, a 50m lap pool and an outdoor aquatic area.

307,Commercial–Broadway station,"Commercial–Broadway (formerly two separate stations, Broadway and Commercial Drive) is a rapid transit station complex in Metro Vancouver's SkyTrain system in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It serves an elevated portion of the Expo Line and a below-grade portion of the Millennium Line. It is a major transit hub, with the most boardings of any SkyTrain station, and a terminus of the region's busiest bus route, the 99 B-Line.


== Location ==
Commercial–Broadway station is located just east of the intersection of East Broadway and Commercial Drive in East Vancouver, on the outskirts of Vancouver's Little Italy district. Part of the station is elevated over East Broadway, while another section is located deep within the Grandview Cut south of Grandview Highway North. The two sections are connected via a pedestrian overpass that crosses East Broadway.


== History ==
Commercial–Broadway station is a merger of two existing stations: Broadway station on the Expo Line and Commercial Drive station on the Millennium Line.
Broadway station was built in 1985 on the original Expo Line. It has been one of the system's busiest stations and in 2002 became a transfer point to the Millennium Line via the connected Commercial Drive station.
Commercial Drive station was built in 2002 as the temporary terminus of the first segment of the Millennium Line, with connections to the Expo Line's Broadway station. The Millennium Line has since been extended westward, and out of the Grandview Cut, by 0.75 kilometres (0.47 mi), to terminate at VCC–Clark station.
In November 2008, renovations began on Broadway station, including the addition of a new entrance on the south side of the station from 10th Avenue, the replacement and relocation of the station's elevator, and the refitting of the original metal mesh paneling on the ground level with glass. These upgrades were completed in October 2009.Both stations were formally merged and renamed on September 7, 2009, due to concern over potential confusion with Broadway–City Hall station of the then-new Canada Line. Commercial Drive became platforms 1 and 2 of the new station, while Broadway became platforms 3 and 4.
Prior to October 22, 2016, the station was one of only four in the world where the same metro line (in this case, the Millennium Line) ran through a station twice in a pretzel configuration, the others being the Serdika and Serdika II stations on the Sofia Metro in Sofia, Bulgaria, the Monument Metro station on the Tyne and Wear Metro in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, and Voorweg RandstadRail station on the Randstadrail in The Hague, Netherlands.


== Upgrades ==
In conjunction with the Evergreen Extension project, major upgrades at the station began in the second quarter of 2015 to accommodate increased passenger volumes and enhance the passenger environment. Originally scheduled to be completed by mid-2017, these upgrades were completed and opened to the public on February 2, 2019. The upgrades include:
A new platform (platform 5) to the east of platforms 3 and 4, which improves passenger traffic on those platforms by providing extra platform capacity for Waterfront station–bound Expo trains. Waterfront-bound trains at this station open their doors on both sides, allowing all-door boarding and alighting.
Added weather protection and amenities for bus passenger waiting areas.
Access improvements within the station, including upgraded passageways, vertical movement, and entrances.
A new pedestrian plaza for the portion of the station south of Broadway.
A new bike parkade which accommodates up to 42 bicycles.


== Services ==
Commercial–Broadway station is a major connection point for TransLink bus routes that run along Broadway, including the 9 trolley bus and the 99 B-Line, an articulated express bus with limited stops and direct access to the University of British Columbia.
There is an A&W, a Shoppers Drug Mart, and a Blenz Coffee at ground level.
Prior to the upgrading of Broadway station between 2008 and 2009, the station contained the ""Broadway Smoke Shoppe"", ""The Exchange"", and the ""Vancouver Ticket Centre"", three small convenience and retail outlets introduced as part of a retail program established with the opening of SkyTrain in 1986.

308,"Queen Elizabeth Park, British Columbia","Queen Elizabeth Park is a 130-acre municipal park located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is located on top of Little Mountain (elevation approximately 125 metres or 410 feet above sea level) and is the location of former basalt quarries that were dug in the beginning of the twentieth century to provide material for roads in the city.


== History ==
Before European settlement, the park was an old-growth forest and a spawning ground for salmon. Grey wolves, elk and bears would frequent the area. The settler population which began in earnest in the 1870s exterminated the grey wolves, elk and bears, chopped down all the old growth forest and paved over the salmon creeks. The salmon creeks that extend from Queen Elizabeth to False Creek do still exist today, but they have been paved over and are so polluted that salmon no longer use them.In 1936, the BC Tulip Association suggested the creation of sunken gardens within the old quarries to the city's park board. By the end of that decade, the site had been turned over to the Vancouver Park Board for park and recreation purposes. The park was dedicated by King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth (the mother of Queen Elizabeth II) during their visit to Vancouver in 1939, as King and Queen of Canada. From that time, Park staff incrementally transformed the overgrown hillsides into Canada's first civic arboretum, with a generous donation from the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association. The popular quarry gardens were designed by Park Board Deputy Superintendent Bill Livingstone and were unveiled in the early 1960s.
Prentice Bloedel's gift of $1.25 million funded the open reservoirs and built the country's first geodesic conservatory, which is surrounded by covered walkways, lighted fountains and a sculpture, Henry Moore's Knife Edge Two Piece 1962–65. The Bloedel Floral Conservatory opened on December 6, 1969 amidst much jubilation. Its enclosed tropical garden houses 500 exotic plants and flowers and more than a hundred free-flying tropical birds.


== Attractions ==
There are several other attractions in the park including: 

Arboretum
Celebration Pavilion
Bloedel Floral Conservatory
Fountains/Plaza
Quarry Gardens
Painters' Corner
SculptureSeveral episodes of the long running TV show Stargate SG-1 were filmed there.


== Activities ==
Activities at Queen Elizabeth Park include:

309,Scotiabank Field at Nat Bailey Stadium,"Scotiabank Field at Nat Bailey Stadium (known as ""The Nat"" and commonly by its previous name Nat Bailey Stadium) is home to the Vancouver Canadians of the Northwest League in the summer.


== Stadium history ==
Originally built in 1951 as Capilano Stadium, it was renamed Nat Bailey Stadium in 1978 to honour the work of Vancouver restaurateur (and founder of the White Spot restaurant chain) Nat Bailey after his death to honour his tireless effort to promote baseball in Vancouver.
Scotiabank Field at Nat Bailey Stadium is located on the eastern side of Queen Elizabeth Park in the Riley Park-Little Mountain neighbourhood of Vancouver.
The stadium was first home to the Vancouver Capilanos in the early 1950s and later attracted the Oakland Oaks, who became the Vancouver Mounties of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, from 1956 to 1962, and 1965 through 1969.  The PCL returned to Vancouver in 1978 with the Vancouver Canadians, owned by Harry Ornest. He purchased most of the primary assets of Sick's Stadium in Seattle and shipped them north for use at Nat Bailey. The Canadians stayed in Vancouver through the 1999 season, then relocated south to Sacramento, California. The following season, a second incarnation of the Canadians began playing in the short-season Class A Northwest League.
The stadium's capacity is 6,500.
The Canadians ownership signed a long term lease at Scotiabank Field at Nat Bailey Stadium in February 2007. They have significantly improved and modernized the stadium while also restoring parts of the park to their original 1951 condition. The addition of Bud Kerr Baseball Museum followed in 2008.The stadium was used as the home of the fictional Santa Barbara Seabirds Class A Minor League Baseball team in the ""Dead Man's Curveball"" episode of the television series Psych.  It was also used as the home of the fictional Seacouver Chiefs in the ""Manhunt"" episode of Highlander: The Series. It's also the setting for a scene between MacGyver and Reggie Jackson in the MacGyver episode ""Squeeze Play"".


== Naming rights ==
On June 16, 2010, Scotiabank and the Vancouver Canadians announced a naming rights agreement that would rename Nat Bailey Stadium as ""Scotiabank Field at Nat Bailey Stadium"".

311,Bloedel Floral Conservatory,"The Bloedel Floral Conservatory in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, is a conservatory and aviary located at the top of Queen Elizabeth Park.


== History ==
In 1966, communities and organizations across Canada were encouraged to engage in centennial projects to celebrate the country's 100th anniversary. The projects ranged from special one-time events to local improvement projects. In Vancouver, Stuart Lefeaux, superintendent of the Vancouver Park Board and his deputy Bill Livingstone wanted to create an exciting icon that would enhance the image of the city. Their vision was to build a conservatory for exotic plants that would be both educational and a good place for families to go.
Building a conservatory on top of Queen Elizabeth Park's Little Mountain was a complicated project. The city had already leased the top of the mountain to the Greater Vancouver Water Board and they had built a ​5 1⁄2-acre open water reservoir for the city's potable water supply. A concrete lid was constructed in 1965 to cover the reservoir, but approval was needed to build the conservatory's surrounding plaza on top of the cover. The project was not to detract from the natural beauty of the site, nor to jeopardize the quality of the potable water supply in the reservoir. Climates had to be simulated for temperate, tropical and arid areas in the botanical displays inside the conservatory, and the project was not to exceed the budget. Giving the immense concrete plaza over the reservoir an attractive garden atmosphere meant working within rigid and expensive water board restrictions.
These challenges were overcome, and the conservatory was constructed next to this reservoir, which remains a major source of water for the city today.
Philanthropy from extraction companies was at an all-time high during the 1960s, so Lefeux and Livingstone looked for a way to get the project funded. They approached Prentice Bloedel of the Macmillan Bloedel Lumber Company. The Bloedel Foundation put forward $1.25 million in conjunction with contributions by the City of Vancouver and the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation to build the Bloedel Conservatory, the Dancing Fountains and the surrounding plaza. This gift was the largest the city of Vancouver had received to that date.
The triodetic dome frame was manufactured entirely in Ottawa and shipped 3,000 miles across the country to Queen Elizabeth Park. Once it arrived, the structural framework was erected in
just 10 days. The entire dome and plaza took 18 months to complete. The grand opening of the conservatory took place to much fanfare on December 6, 1969 and hosted over 500,000 people in its first year of operation. Prentice and his wife Virginia, both avid art collectors, also donated the monumental bronze sculpture 'Knife Edge - Two Piece' by famed artist Henry Moore.
In November 2009, facing a large budget shortfall, the Vancouver Park Board voted in favour of closing the conservatory. The approximately $240,000 CDN annual operating budget, the need for a roof replacement and other major capital costs were cited by members of the board as reasons for the decision. The closure was to take effect on March 1, 2010, just after Vancouver had finished hosting the 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. In response to the decision several groups formed in order to lobby both the board and city council.In early January 2010, a commissioner reported that attendance numbers were up sharply in December 2009 over December 2008 now that construction projects at the adjacent reservoir on Little Mountain and along Cambie Street, which started in 2003, had been completed. By the end of January, the Friends of the Bloedel Association had helped raise $80,000, and was projecting $250,000 by the proposed March closure. In late February, the park board voted to keep the facility open and asked for proposals on running it.On April 29, 2010, the Friends of the Bloedel Association and VanDusen Botanical Garden Association submitted a proposal to the Vancouver Park Board to run the Bloedel Conservatory as part of the VanDusen Botanical Gardens, and the conservatory remained open. At least one other proposal was received, but the joint proposal of the Friends of the Bloedel and the Association was approved by the Services and Budgets Committee of the Vancouver Park Board on July 20, 2010, and unanimously approved by the full Park Board on September 20, 2010. On May 29, 2013, the Friends of the Bloedel won the City of Vancouver Heritage Commission Award of Honour, which ""denotes an outstanding contribution to heritage conservation in the City of Vancouver and recognizes the advocacy and successful efforts to save and revitalize landmark sites"". The VanDusen Botanical Garden Association later changed their name to the Vancouver Botanical Gardens Association to reflect the additional management of Bloedel Conservatory.


== Plants and animals ==
The conservatory contains three habitats: tropical rainforest, subtropical rainforest, and desert. Over 200 birds of various species reside within the dome and are allowed to fly free.  Also on display are an array of tropical fish. The Bloedel Floral Conservatory houses about 500 species and varieties of plants from deep jungle to desert clime, all within the dome. The conservatory is home to Bougainvilleas and Browallias, citrus and coffee trees, Eucalypti and epiphytes, Euphorbia and various figs, Gardenia and Hibiscus. Magnolia trees share space with delicate lilies, yucca with pteris (ferns).


== Architecture ==
Located 500 feet (150 m) above sea level, the conservatory itself is 140 feet (43 m) in diameter, 70 feet (21 m) high, and is made up of 1,490 plexiglass bubbles and 2,324 pieces of extruded aluminum tubing. There are 32 different shapes and sizes, but each bubble measures 9 inches in height. It contains 8 air circulating units and 24 mist sprayers to control temperature and humidity for 3 separate climatic zones inside the dome.
The Triodetic System was developed and patented in Canada in 1955 by F. Fentiman and Sons of Ottawa. This system was originally made from aluminum components. It uses extruded cylindrical solid aluminum hubs (nodes) with slots, and tubular aluminum or steel members with matching crimped ends. Triodetic joints resist tension, compression and combined cross loading. Triodetic domes are designed as double curved shells which allow increased structural advantages for the span:rise ratio. The use of triangles makes the structure rigid and very strong, and similar to the geodesic design, stresses are transmitted throughout the structure. Even with light structural components, triodetic domes are able to withstand extremes of wind and even earth quakes. This enables a large interior volume to be enclosed without the need for internal supporting columns.
In the plaza adjacent to the conservatory dome is a bronze sculpture by Henry Moore, Knife Edge Two Piece 1962–65. It was donated to the Park Board by avid modern art collector Prentice Bloedel and his wife Virginia along with the funding to build the conservatory, the surrounding plaza and fountains.
Moore created this piece in 1962, and authorized three castings of the work. The first stands on Nelson Rockefeller's New York estate, the second is outside the House of Lords, in London,
England, and the third is situated to the south of the conservatory next to the Dancing Fountains. Knife Edge was the first non-commemorative sculpture accepted by the Vancouver Park Board. It was donated by Prentice Bloedel and his wife Virginia to tie the conservatory dome and the design of the adjacent fountain plaza to the inspiration and power of nature.

== Filming location ==
The conservatory has been used as a filming location for several movies and science fiction series including G-Saviour, Battlestar Galactica, Stargate SG-1, Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda and Beyond the Black Rainbow. Filming of a scene from episode 21, Season 3 of Supergirl also took place here.

313,Little Mountain (British Columbia),"Little Mountain, elevation 125 m (410 ft), is a mountain in the central part of the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The mountain is home to Queen Elizabeth Park, which sits at the top of the mountain, and Nat Bailey Stadium, which is located near the base. The mountain lends its name to the Riley Park–Little Mountain neighbourhood, and to the defunct electoral district, Vancouver-Little Mountain.


== History ==
Little Mountain is a volcanic outcropping that was formed between 31 to 34 million years ago.

The land containing Little Mountain was originally owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway, which created a basalt rock quarry that operated from 1890–1911. The rocks from the quarry were primarily used to build roads in the Gastown, Shaughnessy and South Vancouver, British Columbia. In the 1920s, one of the quarries was converted in a water reservoir for the city. When Queen Elizabeth Park was established in 1940, the reservoir was covered over by a parking lot.

314,Stratford Hall (school),"Stratford Hall, an independent coeducational school located on the east side of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, opened on September 5, 2000. Stratford Hall is one of five Western Canada schools to complete International Baccalaureate experience with IB offered from Kindergarten through Grade 12 to all students. The school teaches the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme, the International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme, and Diploma Programmes. In accordance with the IB philosophy, the school emphasizes multilingual ability and a global perspective. Graduates obtain an IB diploma recognized by universities worldwide.
Stratford Hall is an 'urban' school located on Commercial Drive, with a separate building for each IB program, and each has characteristics specially designed for students. Common to each building is a sense of openness and student spaces, and for collaboration.


== History ==
Stratford Hall was founded in the late 1990s by two Burnaby mothers, Elaine Lee and Cindy Leung, who wanted a university preparatory option for their own children. They formed a not-for-profit society, the Burnaby Independent School Society (now the Stratford Hall (School) Society), and in October 1999, they appointed Jim McConnell as Head of School. They also secured a temporary site, the Italian Cultural Centre, which served the school for its first nine years.
Classes began in September 2000; at this point, the school had 40 students from kindergarten to grade 6. Since then, the school has added approximately 40 new students each year. A second kindergarten class was created in 2001, and in May 2007 the first set of students graduated from grade 12. Stratford Hall's current enrolment is 511 students from kindergarten to grade 12 and accepts up to 70 students per year.
The International Baccalaureate Programme was introduced in October 1999. In 2003, the school was awarded authorization for the IB Primary Years Programme, and was the first school in Western Canada to do so. In 2005, it achieved authorization for the IB Diploma Programme, ensuring that its first graduating class would be IB Diploma candidates. It achieved full authorization for the Middle Years Programme in 2009. It is now one of 5 schools in the Lower Mainland, one of 12 in Canada, and one of 185 in the world to offer the full IB Continuum Programme.Stratford Hall was accepted into the Independent Schools Association of BC in 2003, and into the Canadian Association of Independent Schools in 2005.
In September 2005, the grade 6-12 program was moved from the Italian Cultural Centre to its current building, the former Ailanthus Centre on Commercial Drive. The DP Building, located in a facility that formerly housed a performing arts centre for youth, offers its students an enriched academic curriculum, which includes music (e.g. taiko drumming and marimba), visual arts, performing arts (e.g. circus, theatre, and theatre production), sports science, and outdoor education. 
The first Stratford Hall grade 12 class graduated in May 2007. There were only 6 graduates. The smallest graduating class, consisting of 1 student, graduated in 2008.
In 2007, Stratford Hall purchased a lot on the same block of Commercial, and in 2008, construction began on the new Primary Years facility. The new building, designed specifically for the IB Primary Years Programme, opened in November 2009. 
In 2012, construction began on the a new Middle Years Programme building for grade 6-10 students, located at 3150 Commercial Drive. This building opened in January 2014. The school has now three distinct buildings, one for each of the IB programmes.


== Athletics and co-curricular programs ==
A few clubs are Model United Nations, cooking, music (choir, rock band), Global Humanitarian Club, and debate.
Beginning in grade 3, students may participate in a number of school teams including cross-country running, soccer, volleyball, basketball, ultimate, track and field and badminton. Stratford Hall is a member of a number of independent school leagues.","['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Stratford_Hall%2C_Vancouver%2C_BC_2.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg']",49.25762999999999891542756813578307628631591796875,-123.0695400000000034879121812991797924041748046875
315,St. Paul's Indian Residential School,"St Paul’s Indian Residential School (also known as the Squamish Indian Residential School or St. Francis Indian Residential School) was a Canadian Indian residential school and was located in the 500 Block West Keith Road at what is now the site of St. Thomas Aquinas Regional Secondary School in the City of North Vancouver. It was a Roman Catholic school and operated from 1899 to 1958 by the Order of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate. The students of the school were from the adjacent Mission Reserve as well other Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh and Musqueam children.


== History ==
The Parish of St Paul's was established by Father Leon Fouquet who constructed the St Paul's Indian Church which opened as a chapel in 1866. When Bishop Durieu came to the Church to work with the Squamish people he decided he wanted to provide schooling for them. He led the construction of St Paul's School, located on the Mission Reserve in North Vancouver. In 1898 he wrote to the Motherhouse of the Sisters of the Child Jesus in Lepuy, France. The First three sisters arrived on October 5, 1898, making it the first school for First Nations people on the north shore.
The Squamish people supported the school with food and other donations until 1900 when the Department of Indian Affairs took over administration of the school. Indian Affairs' intention was to assimilate the First Nations people by denying them rights to their language, culture and traditions while forcing them to take on the colonialist language, culture, traditions and Roman Catholic Religion. 
In 1920 the Indian Act was amended and Canadian federal legislation making it mandatory for every Indian child to be sent to residential schools upon reaching 7 years of age until 16 years of age. Most of children came from the surrounding Squamish Nation reserves along Burrard Inlet, Howe Sound, and the Squamish River. Other students were from the Tsleil-Waututh and Musqueam nations, and some came from as far away as the Lil'wat (Mount Currie) band, near Pemberton, as well as the Shishalh (Sechelt) and Sto:lo peoples. Over 2000 students in six generations attended the school, arriving at between 4 and 6 years of age. The students stayed until the eighth grade, or until the age of 16 very few made it to twelfth grade graduation. Children in the school were segregated by age group and gender and were often not permitted to visit other family members in the school. They were stripped of their culture and were punished for taking part in their own language or cultural traditions.


== Contemporary Building ==
The St Paul’s Indian Residential School was torn down in 1959.  The site was turned over to the Catholic Arch-Diocese, a Catholic School Board which supervised the building of  St Thomas Aquinas Catholic High School on the grounds. First Nations students were allowed to attend this school and came from the Squamish Nation, Mt Currie and Powell River under the direction of the Department of Indian Affairs.  The high school still remains on the original site today and some Squamish students still attend each year.


== Memorial ==
On August 13, 2013 the mayor of the City of North Vancouver agreed to construct a monument honoring the survivors from St Paul’s Indian Residential School. The memorial is an art piece in the form of a wave with a high point representing pre-European contact, a low point in the wave representing the residential school era and a rising wave with a canoe and two children representing the First Nations recovering from the experience. The base is made of concrete and the canoe and children are carved red cedar.

== Football ==
In 2010, under the direction of PE Teacher Bobby Gibson, Eric Hamber became the only public school in Vancouver to have an American Football program. In the 2010 season, the Eric Hamber Griffins competed in the Junior Varsity AA league only. In the 2011 season, the Griffins competed with teams in both the Junior Varsity AA and Varsity Tier II leagues. In 2012, both the Junior Varsity and Varsity teams competed in the AA league. That year, the Junior Varsity team made the playoffs, becoming the first Griffins Football team to do so, losing in the first round. In 2013, the Griffins Junior Varsity team competed in an amalgamated AA/AAA league while the Varsity team was relegated at the school's request to the Tier II development league. The Junior Varsity team failed to make the playoffs while the Varsity team was defeated in the first round of the Tier II championship.
Beginning in 2014, Eric Hamber stopped fielding both a Junior Varsity and Varsity team, opting to join the teams and compete with a roster consisting of Grade 9 to 12 players in the Tier II development League. In the 2014 season, the Griffins made it to the final of the Tier II Provincial Championship. In 2015, the Griffins continued to field only one team, with that team losing in the semi-finals of the provincial tournament. 
Starting in 2012, Eric Hamber began a Grade 8 football program in the spring. The team does not play in the formal Grade 8 fall league but organizing exhibition games with other schools during the spring sports season. The program also organizes a flag football program in the spring for feeder elementary schools to promote a culture of football amongst students who are likely to eventually attend to Eric Hamber. 
Eric Hamber Griffins Football runs with relative independence from the athletics department of the school due to its unique province-wide league and player-based funding. Player fees range from $250-300 based on the season and funding is available for those who can't afford the costs.

317,Arbutus Ridge,"Arbutus Ridge is an affluent residential neighbourhood in Vancouver's West Side. It is bordered by 16th Avenue in the north, 41st Avenue in the south, Mackenzie Street in the west, and East Boulevard in the east. The neighbourhood is characterized by larger than average lot sizes, with stately homes on tree-lined streets.

One of the catalysts for growth in the neighbourhood was the existence of the Vancouver-Steveston Interurban route of the British Columbia Electric Railway, which ran between 1905 and 1958. The route once followed by the interurban is now part of the Arbutus Greenway.


== History ==
In 1888, the Province granted 2,100 hectares (5,289 acres) of land to the Canadian Pacific Railway, including a large portion of what is now Arbutus Ridge. The land consisted of uplands that surrounded a low-lying marsh area called Asthma Flats. The upland areas were developed first, between 1912 and the 1930s. In the 1940s and 1950s, the marsh was filled in with sand brought in from False Creek to allow the development of houses and shops.


== Education ==
Prince of Wales Secondary School is located in the neighbourhood, along with Carnarvon Elementary School and Trafalgar Elementary School, which offers a French immersion program.


== Businesses ==
Arbutus Ridge is a predominantly residential area with small businesses clustering along Arbutus, between Broadway and W. 16th Avenue.


== Houses ==
Most of the lot sizes are large (50-foot frontage by 120-foot depth), with stately homes on tree-lined streets.  In the spring, the area becomes a mecca for cherry blossom enthusiasts, with its many blocks full of blossoms.


== Heritage ==
The Curry Residence at the intersection of Arbutus Street and West Eighteen Avenue is a one-storey and basement single-family residence.  The house is a relatively rare example of Mission Style domestic architecture in Vancouver.


== Accommodation ==
There are no hotels, however, there are a few bed and breakfast in the area, including Vancouver Traveller Bed and Breakfast on West 21st Avenue, between Arbutus Street and Yew Street.

318,VanDusen Botanical Garden,"In 1970 the Vancouver Foundation, the British Columbia provincial government, and the city of Vancouver signed an agreement to provide the funding to develop a public garden on part of the old Shaughnessy Golf Course. That garden, VanDusen Botanical Garden, is situated in the Shaughnessy neighbourhood of  Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada at the North West corner of 37th Avenue and Oak Street. It is named for local lumberman and philanthropist Whitford Julian VanDusen.The Botanical Garden opened to the public on August 30, 1975 and remains jointly managed by the Vancouver Park Board and the Vancouver Botanical Gardens Association (VBGA), similar to the operation of nearby Bloedel Conservatory. An administrative staff is bolstered by approximately 1200 non-gardening volunteers and six full-time unionized gardeners with seasonal interns assisting during the summer. The VBGA is responsible for membership, volunteering, education, the library, and development fundraising.
VanDusen's volunteers have a 45-year history in the garden and often exhibit a proprietary connection to the trees, shrubs and annuals. Trained volunteer guides interpret the plant collection and the history of the garden to visitors on foot and in motorized golf carts from April through October (see web site for actual dates, the carts have a limited season). In addition to guiding tours, volunteers collect seeds of annuals and perennials (which they clean and package for sale in the garden shop and on the Internet). Other volunteers operate the information desk, produce dried flower arrangements, staff a large and very successful plant sale each spring, write and produce self-guided tours to hand out to visitors, package manure and compost for sale to local gardeners, and work with Park Board staff to install plant identification signs in the garden.
The Garden covers 22 hectares (55 acres). In addition to displays of plants from all over the world, there is an extensive collection of native British Columbia (Northwest Coast) plants. A recently launched ""re-wilding"" outreach program aims to rescue and propagate native plants for reintroduction into Vancouver's regional parks.
Although the garden's mission statement upholds the ideals of a botanical garden, an early decision not to partake in scientific research channeled funds and energy into garden construction and released the staff from the responsibility of building research collections or a herbarium. The VBGA conducts citizen science initiatives and works with local community partners and schools interested in on-site research.
More recently, the garden's Visitor Centre was designed and built to a LEED Platinum standard. Opened in November 2011, this modern structure features a gift/garden shop, a  specialized botanical library, a restaurant and a coffee shop. The VanDusen Botanical Garden Visitors Center project, registered with the International Living Future Institute, is pursuing a Living Building Challenge certification.
The building was constructed under the direction Cornelia Oberlander landscape architect, Perkins and Will Canada  architects, Morrison Hershfield energy consultants, Fast + Epp structural engineers, StructureCraft timber design-builders, and Ledcor Construction Limited.In addition to water features throughout the rolling landscape, special features in the garden include carved totem poles, large stone sculptures, and a Korean Pavilion. Children enjoy the maze adjacent to VanDusen's heirloom vegetable garden.
The Education Centre, located at the rear of the garden, houses a seed bank and serves as home to the Vancouver Festival of Lights volunteers, seed collectors, the Sakura Festival staff and the dried flower arrangers.
May is Rhodo time at VanDusen and visitors are treated to a large colourful collection of species and hybridized Rhododendron cultivars. The collection is estimated at nearly 1,000 different varieties of rhodos. Some can be found blooming virtually year round, with intense blooms of species rhodos in the Sino Himalayan garden in the late months of winter. Also of note are  cultivars of Fagus sylvatica, as well as collections of Sorbus, Fraxinus and Magnolia.
Specialized niche plantings include a Heather garden, a ""black"" garden, a seasonal ""Laburnum Walk"", a majestic stand of Sequoiadendron giganteum, a cypress pond, a formal perennial garden, a heritage vegetable garden (seasonal), a fragrance garden (seasonal) of course, and the large sino-Himalayan garden which covers about eight acres by itself.
In recognition of the extensive and timeless design work that makes VanDusen the pride of Vancouver's gardeners, R. Roy Forster was recognized with the Order of Canada on April 14, 1999, for his work in designing the gardens and their plant collections. Forester continued earlier landscape work established by Bill Livingston of the Vancouver Park Board. Appreciation for Forster's contribution to the design of the garden was recognized recently by VBGA renaming Cypress Pond the Roy Forster Pond.The garden is open to the public every day of the year except Christmas. There are admission fees for day visitors and memberships (family and individual) for repeat visitors.

319,Lower Lonsdale,"Lower Lonsdale is a historic waterfront neighbourhood in the city of North Vancouver. Lower Lonsdale runs up Lonsdale Avenue from Lonsdale Quay to Keith Road. The area is characterized by its progressive feel of trendy businesses, a high end sex shop, outdoor fitness stores, eclectic cafes, and diverse restaurants. With a history of ship building, Lower Lonsdale has gone through a major waterfront renewal processes. The old shipyards have been torn down, making way for new public spaces, buildings, condominiums, and fashionable outlets.


== History ==
Before the emergence of today’s neighbourhood, the First People to call this parcel of land home was the Squamish peoples who built permanent villages and fishing camps along the community’s shoreline and river-inlets, sustaining themselves by fishing, hunting and food-gathering. Just over 200 years ago, the Squamish peoples had their first encounter with the Spanish who were the first Europeans to arrive in the area. However, in 1792, Captain George Vancouver of England also arrived to explore the shores of North Vancouver. But, it was not until 1860 that a Catholic Missionary was ordered to build a church on the water front of what is now called St. Pauls Church. Shortly afterwards, T. W. Graham and George Scrimgeour secured a pre-emption of 150 acres (0.61 km2), the first on the North Shore of the Burrard Inlet. They proceeded to build a mill and named it The Pioneer Mills. This consequently initiated an influx of residents. However, with the mill facing bankruptcy, an American by the name of Sewell Prescott Moody bought it. The name Lonsdale comes from Arthur Pemberton Heywood-Lonsdale who, along with J.P. Fell opened land to settlers in 1903.


== Gentrification ==
In the 1990s and 2000s, the City of North Vancouver embarked on an ambitious plan to redevelop former industrial lands of Lower Lonsdale. Highrise and lowrise condominium and other multi-family developments were constructed in the area between 3rd Street and south to the waterfront.
During that time, many new restaurants and retailers have located in the stretch of Lonsdale Avenue between 3rd Street and Burrard Inlet. The City also oversaw the construction of the John Braithwaite Community Center, located in the 100 block of 1st Street.

321,Hastings Mill Park,"Hastings Mill Park is located on the waterfront in the West Point Grey neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and has recently received an upgrade from a joint partnership between the Vancouver Park Board and local landscape architects at PWL Partnership. The renewed playground was built to engage a wider age range of children and to bring historical significance to the on-site Hastings Mill Museum which showcases Vancouver's logging history.


== History ==
The historic site of Hasting Mills Museum, is what draws significance to the park. The land where the museum resides was originally owned by the Provincial Government. The building that hosts the museum was originally the Hastings Mill Store, the first general store erected in Vancouver in 1865 by British Captain Edward Stamp’s British Columbia and Vancouver Island Spar, Lumber and Sawmill Company. This building was one of the few buildings to survive the Great Fire of 1886 and was moved from the burrard inlet by barge to its current location at the foot of Alma Street by the Native Daughters of British Columbia. The museum was officially dedicated as a museum of B.C. historical relics in memory of the pioneers in 1932 and currently shows a wide range of First Nations artifacts as well as photographs from the Vancouver Pioneer Association.The Museum is open Tuesday-Sunday 1-4 pm and is closed during the months of December and January.


== Construction ==
The Vancouver Park board collaborated with the architects at PWL Partnership in order to build a new playground which would be more child friendly and suitable for a wider range of ages. A public open house was conducted in the summer of 2015 in order to gain feedback from the community into the new design. The renovated playground opened in the fall of 2016 and now consists of two tall swings, two toddler swings, two standard swings, adventure log playground and a new playhouse with a sand area. The new playground is made entirely out of wood logs and timber to recall the history of the city's logging pioneer community.


== Surrounding facilities ==
The Royal Vancouver Yacht Club, Jericho Tennis Club, Jericho Park and Beach are all located within walking distance from the park. Located at Jericho Park and Beach are public bathrooms, pay parking, a concession stand, and various sports fields such as a basketball court and soccer fields.A bike path connects to the Hastings Mill park. This path connects to most of Vancouver's bike paths and can take you towards Pacific Spirit Regional Park or into Downtown Vancouver and is comfortable for all ages and abilities.

323,Park Royal Shopping Centre,"Park Royal Shopping Centre, also known as Park Royal, opened in 1950, is a shopping mall located in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Park Royal is officially Canada's first covered shopping mall. Park Royal currently markets itself as five star shopping and has undergone significant changes to attain this. The shopping centre was originally anchored by Woodward's.
The Centre was started alongside the Guinness family's British Properties developments nearby, and was named after the London suburb of Park Royal where a Guinness brewery stood. The Guinnesses sold it in 1986.
The mall is physically divided into two locations by Marine Drive, a major thoroughfare on the North Shore. The two sides are aptly named North Mall and South Mall, and are connected by 2 main intersections: Main St - Marine Drive, and Taylor Way - Marine Drive, as well as an overpass next to Shoppers Drug Mart. The North Mall is the original part of the mall, and had the anchor store Woodward's (on the East end) and Woodward's Food Floors (on the West end). Expansion to the South Mall occurred in the 1962 with a further development in the mid-1970s. The expansion in the 1960s added SuperValu and Eaton's as the anchor stores on the South Mall. Further expansion in the mid-1970s added a second floor to the mall and the Hudson's Bay store.
In the 1980s when Woodward's closed, The Bay moved into the location previously held by Woodward's, and the Food Floor was converted into a Government Liquor Store, London Drugs and Rogers Video (now closed).
The entire mall covers roughly 1.4 million square feet.


== The Village ==
In late 2004, The Village was opened as an expansion of the South Mall, allowing for more stores and retail services. The Village was designed as a joint venture by the architectural firms, F+A Architects (Pasadena, California) and Musson Cattell Mackey Partnership (Vancouver). The 238,000 square foot (22,111 m²) expansion cost approximately $30 million Canadian dollars. The Village is Canada's first lifestyle centre specifically designed for the affluent West Vancouver market, where all the retail locations offer mid to upscale lifestyle services. The Village is unique in that it aims to replicate the experience found at Whistler Village, where consumers are predominantly in the open-air (outside) to browse the stores. A bowling alley and a golf practice range were demolished to make way for The Village. Home Depot's first Canadian urban concept store is located at The Village. It features pre-built fully furnished rooms and other customizable household furnishings for consumers to choose from.


== Shops and services ==
Park Royal South anchor stores include: Best Buy, La Maison Simons and Sport Chek. Since 2013, Park Royal has been undergoing major renovations, and has introduced a new village that includes retailers such as: Urban Outfitters, Zara, H&M, Aritzia and Anthropologie. In 2015, Park Royal closed the old food court on the south side, and revealed a new, updated version the floor above with popular chains such as Booster Juice, Freshii, and Chatime. In 2015, Canadian retailer Simons moved into the space that used to be occupied by Extra Foods. In 2017, The Canpets was replaced by a new store, Miniso. Park Royal also offers complimentary Wifi all over the mall. A new VIP Cineplex movie theatre above The Brick opened on April 3, 2019.


== Transportation ==
Park Royal also acts as an area transit hub, known as the Park Royal Exchange, with various TransLink buses and West Vancouver Blue Buses serving this location.

329,Vancouver Kingsway,"Vancouver Kingsway is a federal electoral district in British Columbia, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1953 to 1988 and since 1997. It is located in Vancouver.


== Demographics ==
This riding's population is over 54% immigrants. The three largest ethnic groups include Chinese (36%), European (31.7%) and Filipino (12.5%). The service sector, retail trade and manufacturing are the major sources of employment in Vancouver Kingsway. The average family income is over $72,000. Unemployment is around 6.5%.9.9% of the population is Buddhist, the highest in Canada. More generally, Vancouver Kingsway has the highest proportion of non-Christians, 62.8% in particular, of which: no religious affiliation: 43.5%, Buddhist: 9.9%, Sikh: 3.2% etc.


== History ==
The name ""Vancouver Kingsway"" has been used twice to describe federal ridings. It was first created in 1952, carved out of Vancouver South riding. In 1987, the riding was divided between Burnaby—Kingsway, Vancouver East, Vancouver Quadra and Vancouver South ridings. In 1996, a new Vancouver Kingsway was created out of these same four ridings.
This riding has been held by the NDP and its precursor CCF for most of its history. The NDP has won 12 of the 18 elections held since the riding was formed in 1953, the Liberals have won five and the Conservatives one. The two candidates who topped the poll in the 2008 election ran again in 2011. The incumbent Member of Parliament, Vancouver lawyer Don Davies, represented the NDP, and Vancouver businesswoman Wendy Yuan represented the Liberal Party again. Davies won by approximately 3,000 votes in 2008. In 2011, Davies quintupled that margin, topping the Liberal candidate by over 15,000 votes, the Conservative candidate by over 10,000 votes, and winning over 50% of the votes cast.
The 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution concluded that the electoral boundaries of Vancouver Kingsway should be adjusted, and a modified electoral district of the same name was created. The redefined Vancouver Kingsway lost its territory west of Main Street to the new district of Vancouver Granville, as well as a small area in its extreme southeast to Vancouver South. These new boundaries were legally defined in the 2013 representation order, which came into effect upon the call of the 2015 election.


=== David Emerson controversy ===
David Emerson was first elected in 2004, for the Liberal Party of Canada, and served in the Cabinet as the Minister of Industry.
Emerson was re-elected as a Liberal in the 2006 election, but crossed the floor two weeks later on February 6, 2006 to become the new Minister of International Trade in Stephen Harper's Conservative government.
Emerson's floor-crossing was highly controversial. Then Prime Minister-designate Stephen Harper dispatched campaign co-chair John Douglas Reynolds, on the day after the election, to offer Emerson a cabinet post in a Conservative government. Emerson's acceptance of that offer made Canadian history, marking the first time a member of parliament, let alone a cabinet minister, had crossed the floor before a new government was even sworn in.
As a result of the controversy, a number of groups formed to fight for Emerson's resignation. Some groups also seek legislation that would prevent floor crossing altogether or restrict a member of parliament if they abandon their party's caucus. Groups that fought against Emerson's defection included the New Democratic Party-aligned Recall David Emerson Campaign, and the Liberal Party-aligned but eventually wholly citizen-driven De-Elect Emerson Campaign.

It is surrounded by Jericho Beach Park, a grassy area with a pond, which is a picnic destination. Jericho Beach is the home of the Jericho Sailing Centre Association.


== Etymology ==
The name Jericho Beach derives from Jeremiah Rogers, who ran a logging camp in the area in the 1860s, either as a corruption of ""Jerry's Cove"" or else as a corruption of his company's name, Jerry & Co.


== Jericho Beach ==
The beach is home to concessions, soccer and baseball fields, picnic tables, public washrooms, among other amenities like beach volleyball nets. Also, there are lifeguards on duty for beach safety from late May to early September. 
It is home to the Jericho Works Yard for the Vancouver Parks Board, a youth hostel, the annual Vancouver Folk Music Festival and the Jericho Sailing Centre.


== Jericho Beach Park ==
Jericho Beach Park is a park that is near Jericho Beach. The park includes a pond, a tennis court, and many picnic areas. Along with Locarno Beach Park (which is a park adjacent to Jericho Beach Park), Jericho Beach Park is home to many rabbits and other animals.

336,John Hendry Park,"John Hendry Park is 27-hectare park in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It's operated by the Vancouver Park Board and the Grandview Community Association. Locals often refer to the park informally as Trout Lake, due to the lake itself being its largest feature.


== History ==
The park was one of Vancouver's first lumbering operations in the late 19th century. The lake was the water source for the Hastings Sawmill, which was owned by industrialist John Hendry. In 1926, Hendry's daughter, who was married to then-governor of BC Eric Hamber, donated the mill property to the Park Board with the condition that it be named after her father.In 1963, the Grandview Community Centre, located near Victoria Drive, was constructed. The community centre was renovated in 1977 and renamed Trout Lake Community Centre.In 2010, the new ice rink and renovations were completed for the 2010 Winter Olympics as the training venue for figure skating, with contributions of $13.15 million from the Park Board, $2.5 million from the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympics (VANOC), and $250,000 from the Grandview Community Association. However, the real cost of the ice rink is estimated at $15.9 million.

337,North Vancouver (city),"The City of North Vancouver is a waterfront municipality on the north shore of Burrard Inlet, directly across from Vancouver, British Columbia. It is the smallest of the three North Shore municipalities, and the most urbanized as well. Although it has significant industry of its own, including shipping, chemical production, and film production, the city is usually considered to be a suburb of Vancouver. The city is served by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, British Columbia Ambulance Service, and the North Vancouver City Fire Department.


== History ==
Moodyville (at the south end of Moody Avenue, now Moodyville Park), is the oldest settlement on Burrard Inlet, predating Vancouver; only New Westminster
is the older non-native settlement in the region. Logging came to the virgin forests of Douglas Fir in North Vancouver, as sailing ships called in to load. A water-powered sawmill was set up in the 1860s at Moodyville, by Sewell Moody. Subsequently, post offices, schools and
a village sprang up. In time, the municipality of North Vancouver (which encompassed the entire North Shore from Deep Cove to Horseshoe Bay) was incorporated in 1891. In the 1880s, Arthur Heywood-Lonsdale and a relation James Pemberton Fell, made substantial investments through their company, Lonsdale Estates, and in 1882 he financed the Moodyville investments. Several locations in the North Vancouver area are named after Lonsdale and his family.The cost of developing the raw mountainous terrain was high and the ocean foreshore was primarily swamp. The distances, rivers and streams that swelled in to destructive debris torrents with the annual snow melt and heavy rainfall, often washed out the many bridges that were required. Not long after the District was formed, an early land developer and second reeve of the new council, James Cooper Keith, personally underwrote a loan to commence construction of a road which undulated from West Vancouver to Deep Cove amid the slashed sidehills, swamps, and burnt stumps. The road, sometimes under different names and not always contiguous, is still one of the most important east-west thoroughfare carrying traffic across the North Shore.
Development was slow at the outset. The population of the District in the 1901 census was only 365 people. Keith joined Edwin Mahon and together they controlled North Vancouver Land & Improvement Company. Soon the pace of development around the foot of Lonsdale began to pick up. The first school was opened in 1902. The District was able to build a municipal hall in 1903 and actually have meetings in North Vancouver (instead of in Vancouver where most of the landowners lived). The first bank and first newspaper arrived in 1905. In 1906 the BC Electric Railway Company opened up a street car line that extended from the ferry wharf up Lonsdale to 12th Street. By 1911 the streetcar system extended west to the Capilano River and east to Lynn Valley.
The owners of businesses who operated on Lonsdale, as part of an initiative lead by Keith and Mahon, brought a petition to District Council in 1905 calling for a new, compact city to be carved out of the unwieldy district.
During the ensuing two years there was much and sometimes heated debate. Some thought the new City should have a new name such as Northport, Hillmont or Parkhill.  Burrard became the favourite of the new names but majority view was that North Vancouver remain in order to remain associated with the rising credibility of Vancouver in financial markets and as a place to attract immigrants.Some thought the boundary of the new City should reflect geography and extend from Lynn Creek or Seymour River west to the Capilano River and extend three miles up the mountainside. That the boundary of the City which came into existence in 1907 just happened to match that of the lands owned by the North Vancouver Land & Improvement Company and Lonsdale Estate was no accident. Since the motivation for creating the City was to reserve local tax revenue for the work of putting in services for the property owned by the major developers, there was little reason to take on any of the burden beyond the extent of their holdings.
Residents in west part of the District of North Vancouver now had less reason to be connected with what remained and they petitioned to create the District of West Vancouver (the west part of the North Shore, not the west side of Vancouver) in 1912. The eastern boundary of that new municipality is for the most part the Capilano River and a community that is easily distinguished from the two North Vancouvers has since developed.

The City of North Vancouver continued to grow around the foot of Lonsdale Avenue. Serviced by the North Vancouver Ferries, it proved a popular area. Commuters used the ferries to work in Vancouver. Street cars and early land speculation, spurred interest in the area. Streets, city blocks and houses were slowly built around lower Lonsdale. Wallace Shipyards, and the Pacific Great Eastern Railway provided an industrial base, although, the late arrival of the Second Narrows railway bridge in 1925 controlled development.

 Sawmills, logging, and small farms continued in the interwar years. Yet the nearby mountains also proved to be a permanent attraction. Ski areas were set up on Grouse Mountain and Mount Seymour.
The North Vancouver mountains have many drainages: Capilano River, MacKay, Mosquito, and Lynn Creeks, and Seymour River. The Depression again bankrupted the city, while the Second World War turned North Vancouver into the Clydeside of Canada with a large shipbuilding program. Housing the shipyard workers provided a new building boom, which continued on through the post-war years. By that time, North Vancouver became a popular housing area.
The area around lower Lonsdale Avenue features several open community spaces, including Waterfront Park, Lonsdale Quay, Ship Builders Square and the Burrard Dry Dock Pier.


== Geography ==

The City of North Vancouver is separated from Vancouver by the Burrard Inlet, and it is surrounded on three sides by the District of North Vancouver.

343,Point Grey Secondary School,"Point Grey Secondary School is a public secondary school located in the Kerrisdale and Shaughnessy neighbourhoods of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.


== History ==
Designed by Fred Townley and Matheson, the main building was built in 1929 in a Collegiate Gothic style. Construction of the school was commissioned by the Municipality of Point Grey prior to amalgamation with the City of Vancouver. Point Grey Secondary was built originally as a junior high school. The first students began classes in September 1929 and the building served as a junior high school until 1965 when it became a full secondary school. In 1965, a new wing was added with a gym, laboratories and a library. In 2006, Point Grey, in conjunction with the Parks Board, completed a new artificial turf field, and have upgraded the track surrounding it to a rubber surface.
Point Grey also offers Advanced Placement courses in Biology, Calculus, Chemistry, Computer Science, English, Physics, and Psychology.In 1962 Point Grey was designated a comprehensive secondary school from grade 8 to 12, as it is today. Although the school offered a full range of courses, its focus was essentially academic. Today eighty-five per cent of Point Grey's grade 12's continue on with post-secondary education.


== Feeder schools ==
For the most part, Point Grey Secondary School receives students from three elementary schools. These include Kerrisdale Elementary School, Quilchena Elementary School, and Southlands Elementary School. However, students also enroll from Talmud Torah, Emily Carr Elementary School, St. Augustine's Elementary School, Shaughnessy Elementary School, General Wolfe Elementary School, L'École Bilingue, Jules Quesnel Elementary School and also from many other private and public schools in the region and all over the Vancouver area and out of boundary.

344,South Granville Rise,"Established in 1907, South Granville (or less commonly ""Uptown"") is an upscale Business Improvement Area (BIA) and neighbourhood south of Vancouver's downtown core, centred along Granville Street and bordered by the neighbourhoods of Kitsilano, Fairview and Shaughnessy.
Separated from Downtown by False Creek, the area runs along Granville Street from the south side of the Granville Street Bridge up to 16th Ave, where storefronts are replaced by the residences and hedges of Shaughnessy.
1907 has been decided as the unofficial birth year of the neighbourhood. In that year Richard Marpole drew up plans for Shaughnessy Heights, the Canadian Pacific Railway's newest subdivision south of 16th Ave, pitched as an alternative to the then-upscale West End (""Blueblood Alley""). This is now known as ""First Shaughnessy"", or simply Shaughnessy. That same year, what was once Centre Street was given its present name, Granville Street, as the portion north of the bridge already bore that name. In 2007, the South Granville BIA commemorated the neighbourhood's centennial by encasing a state-of-the-art, stainless steel time capsule in concrete and stone under the entrance of the historic Stanley Theatre.
As well as being a fast-growing neighbourhood of residences, shops and restaurants, South Granville is home to a vibrant arts and culture scene. The neighbourhood contains a strip, between Broadway and the foot of the Granville Bridge, known as ""Gallery Row"" which is home to a number of art galleries: Bau-Xi Gallery, Douglas Reynolds Gallery. Further south, the neighbourhood is home to the historic Stanley Theatre, built in 1931. Once a popular cinema in its early days, the Stanley Theatre is now the stage of the Arts Club Theatre Company and the Industrial Alliance Stage. 
South Granville is represented in the House of Commons of Canada by Jody Wilson-Raybould, the member for Vancouver-Granville. The neighbourhood is represented in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia as part of the riding of Vancouver-Fairview, the current MLA being George Heyman.

345,Mountain View Cemetery (Vancouver),"Mountain View Cemetery is the only cemetery in the City of Vancouver, British Columbia. Opened in 1886, it is located west of Fraser Street between 31st and 43rd Avenues.  It is owned and operated by the City of Vancouver and occupies 0.43 square kilometres (110 acres) of land, containing more than 92,000 grave sites and over 145,000 interred remains.  The first interment took place on February 26, 1887.  The first interment was supposed to happen in January 1887 but poor weather, a new road, and a broken wagon wheel resulted in the intended first occupant being temporarily buried outside the cemetery.  His body was relocated to inside the cemetery months later.


== History ==
Only one existing cemetery in the vicinity, Fraser Cemetery in New Westminster (established in 1870), is older than Mountain View.  When Mountain View Cemetery opened in 1886, it supplanted burial grounds in what was designated Stanley Park that same year as the city's cemetery. The original parcel of land now known as the ""Old Section"" is bounded by Fraser Street on the east, 37th Avenue on the south, 33rd on the north, and three remaining trees from what was once a row of tall Lawson Cypress trees on the west. Land on the north of this was purchased in 1901 for an expansion and became the ""Horne I Addition"" – named after the developer who sold the land. The Jones farm between 37th and 41st Avenues was added in 1910 as the Jones I and Jones II Additions, and in 1922, an additional piece was acquired west of the Horne I Addition. The ""1919 Addition"" is a tract bounded by 41st and 43rd Avenues, and contains many victims of the Spanish flu pandemic that took many hundreds of lives of local residents.  The final addition is the Abray Park Addition on the western side, acquired in 1941 through a land swap with the Vancouver Park Board and was named after a squatter, Nonus Abray, who previously lived on the land and tended an orchard and grazed cattle there.  Burial sites historically were often grouped together along the lines of religion (e.g., Jewish), nationality (e.g., Chinese and Japanese), or organizational affiliation (e.g., Freemasons and Oddfellows). Other groupings are pauper grave sites and war veterans.
The New Chelsea Housing Society and the Department of Veterans' Affairs, unveiled a memorial consisting of three granite stelia in 1983 dedicated to all Canadian military members who have died. The cemetery also has more than 12,000 Canadian military graves.  The Commonwealth War Graves Commission maintains the graves of 579 Commonwealth service personnel – 319 from World War I and 260 from World War II.  The war graves of the former war are in a special Soldiers' Plot, while those of the latter are either concentrated in a Veterans' Plot or scattered within the cemetery.  Most of the airmen died serving at the Royal Canadian Air Force base at Sea Island, and many sailors were from the HMCS Discovery naval station of the Royal Canadian Navy Volunteer Reserve.In 2005 Birmingham & Wood Architects were commissioned to design three buildings and collaborate in the design of landscape elements as part of the upgrading of Mountain View Cemetery. The three structures included an administration building, landscape maintenance facility and a memorial service building with associated functions. The Celebration Hall has become a popular venue for cultural events adding to the City's roster of performance spaces.
In addition to Birmingham & Wood, the consultant team was composed of two firms of landscape architects, Lees + Associates Landscape Architects and Phillips Farevaag Smallenberg; BTY Group cost consultants; Commonwealth Historic Resource Management Limited heritage consultants; Bush Bohlman Consulting Engineers, The RADA Group and Perez Engineering. The cemetery was officially rededicated July 2009.
Mountain View has been one of the few North American cemeteries allowing 2 members of a family to share the same grave. As of January 1, 2020, City Council expanded this practice via a by-law allowing individuals to share their own or their deceased loved one's grave with up to 3 non-family members or strangers. This option is only available for new graves and primarily designed to reduce the environmental footprint of one's burial. It is also a cheaper alternative as plot cost is divided among its individual buyers. Those opting for this arrangement would be buried on top of one another in a single 4'x8'x9' vertical column and must consent to be interred in a more environmentally-sustainable option, such as 'a shroud or biodegradable container'.


== Notable occupants ==

346,Vancouver Forum,"The Forum (also known as the Exhibition Forum, Vancouver Forum and PNE Forum) is an indoor arena in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada located on the grounds of the Pacific National Exhibition.


== Sports, Ice Hockey and the Canucks ==
The building became Vancouver's premier indoor sports facility in 1936 when the 10,500 seat Denman Arena burned to the ground and was not rebuilt. The arena had seating for  5,050 spectators for hockey and box lacrosse. Some of the other major spectator arenas in the area besides the Forum included the Kerrisdale Arena (Vancouver) and Queen's Park Arena (New Westminster).
It hosted the Pacific Coast Hockey League's and Western Hockey League's Vancouver Canucks from 1945 to 1968. In 1968 The WHL Canucks moved to the newly completed Pacific Coliseum which was located close by on the PNE grounds (the N.H.L. version of the Vancouver Canucks started play in 1970).
The Vancouver Burrards of the Intercity Lacrosse League later known as the Western Lacrosse Association played at the Forum from 1938 until 1949. The team left for Kerrisdale Arena for the 1950 season.
The building was refurbished as a concert and exhibition space in the early 1980s. The hockey boards were removed to create more floor space. Much of the hockey seating remains however along with one of the original press boxes which is still in place. The ice plant has since been removed from the building. The various ice activities that used to take place in the Forum are now held in the Agrodome which is also located on the P.N.E. grounds next to the Pacific Coliseum. The Agrodome had a new separate ice plant installed when the move took place but now shares one with the Pacific Coliseum after the renovations that took place in that facility for the 2010 Vancouver/Whistler Olympic Winter Games.
Roller Derby and Professional Wrestling have also been staged at the Forum at various times throughout its lifespan.


== Concerts ==
It has hosted several concerts during its lifespan, before but mostly after the renovation.
Jimmy Durante played in the Forum during the 1930s. Bing Crosby on the invitation of Vancouver boxer Jimmy McLarnin played a fundraiser for the Sunset Memorial Centre. Crosby staged his radio show in September 1948 in front of a crowd of 9,000 which was a record for the facility.The PNE says Pink Floyd played the Forum, although the band's online record indicate five concerts at the neighbouring and smaller PNE Gardens between 1968 and 1974. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention played a concert on August 25, 1968. A recording of this concert was released in 2012, titled Road Tapes, Venue#1.
In the 1970s it hosted local acts like Prism in 1977 and Triumph in 1978.
In the 1990s Big Audio Dynamite shared a bill with Public Image Ltd, Live, and Blind Melon on March 30, 1992. 
Nirvana played two sold out show's there on January 3 and 4, 1994. In one of the more infamous rock media interviews, Nardwuar interviewed Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love in the Forum dressing room. Soundgarden, Rocket From the Crypt and Pond played the Forum. Since the early 2000s, the venue has become popular with alternative and independent bands. Arcade Fire, Wolfmother, Portishead and the Arctic Monkeys are some of the bands who have played the venue since 2005.
There have been issues surrounding the staging of all ages concerts in recent years. In 2007, a 20-year-old man died in a mosh pit at a Smashing Pumpkins concert.Electronica concerts were banned from the arena in 2012 after neighbourhood complaints about noise from the events.


== Other uses ==

347,Oakridge Centre,"Oakridge Centre (and formerly known as Oakridge Mall) is a shopping centre in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is located at the intersection of West 41st Avenue and Cambie Street.
It was originally opened in 1959 by Woodward's Stores which anchored the centre until it was sold to Hudson's Bay in 1993. A Target was originally planned but however in 2015 Target Canada filed for bankruptcy protection and announced the closing of all stores cancelling 4 locations. It is one of the two largest malls located within the city of Vancouver, the other being CF Pacific Centre, and along with Pacific Centre are two of the most profitable shopping centres in Canada.


== Redevelopment ==
Oakridge Centre is now the centre point for the Oakridge Municipal Town Centre Project, part of a Vancouver urban densification project creating a new high density region with tall apartment towers much like Vancouver's West End in an area now occupied and to be surrounded by single family residences. The application was approved in 2014 and construction has begun in late 2019. Construction regarding the North most and South most tower complexes are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2025. The Design Architect is Henriquez Partners (see Gregory Henriquez) of Vancouver and the Executive Architect is Adamson Architects from Toronto, the redevelopment estimated to cost well over $5 billion Canadian.  On September 15th, 2020, it was announced that the mall would be closing on September 30th, 2020 to demolish the structure to make way for the redevelopment but however, Hudson's Bay, Crate & Barrel and the office towers will remain open during the redevelopment construction. 


== Transportation access ==
The Oakridge–41st Avenue station on the Canada Line is under the plaza at the southwest corner of 41st and Cambie. The mall is also served by TransLink bus service along 41st Avenue and Cambie Street. Parking can be accessed via 44th and Cambie or 45th and Cambie - Due to the ongoing construction, several entrances and parking lots have been shut down.

348,Pacific Coliseum,"The Pacific Coliseum, known to locals as ""The Coliseum"" or the ""Rink on Renfrew,"" is an indoor arena located at Hastings Park in Vancouver, British Columbia. Its main use has been for ice hockey and the arena has been the home for several ice hockey teams.
The arena is the former home of the Vancouver Giants of the Western Hockey League (WHL). Other hockey tenants of the Pacific Coliseum have been the Vancouver Canucks (Western Hockey League) from 1968 to 1970, Vancouver Canucks (National Hockey League) from 1970 to 1995, the Vancouver Nats (WHL) from 1972 to 1973, the Vancouver Blazers (World Hockey Association) from 1973 to 1975, and the Vancouver Voodoo (Roller Hockey International) from 1994 to 1995.
It was completed in 1968 on the site of the Pacific National Exhibition. Its architect and plans were also used for the Northlands Coliseum. Originally holding 15,038 for ice hockey, capacity has fluctuated slightly over the years and currently holds 16,281. During the 2010 Olympic Winter Games, it was the venue for figure skating and short track speed skating. The arena also hosts a variety of concerts and other events.


== History ==
Designed by W. K. Noppe in 1966–67, with its simple geometric shape and distinctive ring of white panels, the building can be classified as formalist architecture. Used initially as home to the WHL's Vancouver Canucks, the building was used to attract an NHL franchise in 1970 and a World Hockey Association franchise in 1973. The Coliseum underwent renovations and additions in the late 1970s, but its role as host of an NHL team and a main venue for events in Vancouver was lost with the building of General Motors Place (now Rogers Arena) in 1995.
The original centre-hung scoreclock was replaced during the 1985 renovations (this renovation work included seismic upgrades to the facility) by a new four-sided centre-hung scoreclock with colour matrix animation/matrix displays along with electronic message boards across the bottom on each side (the original sponsors for this clock were Imperial Tobacco and Molson Brewery), which in 2007 was replaced by a four-sided Daktronics scoreboard with a video display on each side.
Recent renovations were completed in 2007 to upgrade accessibility, seating, HVAC, and ice surface for its use as a venue for the 2010 Winter Olympics. During the renovations prior to the Olympics major upgrades were done to the ice plant at the Pacific Coliseum. The adjacent Agrodome ice plant was decommissioned and both buildings now share the same system located at the Coliseum.


=== Seating capacity ===
The seating capacity for hockey has progressed as follows:

15,038 (1968–1970)

16,553 (1983–1989)

Former owner Arthur Griffiths called the sixth game of the 1994 series, the only Stanley Cup Final game that the Canucks would ever win at the Coliseum, to be ""The greatest game ever played at the Pacific Coliseum,"" and sent the entire city into a frenzy in its wake. The Coliseum would host a viewing of game 7, which the Canucks would lose by a goal, after Nathan LaFayette's potential tying shot went off the post.
The Pacific Coliseum also played host to the 1977 NHL All-Star Game, which saw the Wales Conference All-Stars defeat the Campbell Conference All-Stars 4–3.

354,Janet Smith case,"The Janet Smith case concerns the murder of 22-year-old nursemaid Janet Kennedy Smith in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on 26 July 1924, and the ensuing suspicions of a coverup.


== Background ==
Janet Smith was born in Perth, Scotland on 25 June 1902 to railway fireman Arthur Mitchell Tooner Smith and Joanna Benzies. The family moved to London when she was eleven.
In January 1923, she obtained a position taking care of the newborn daughter of Frederick and Doreen Baker. Frederick Baker ran an import-export business. When the family moved, first to Paris in April, then in October back to Vancouver, she accompanied them.The Bakers were among the social elite of the city. They lived on the fashionable West Side, then moved in May 1924 into the house of Frederick Baker's brother, Richard Plunkett Baker, at 3851 Osler in the exclusive Shaughnessy Heights neighborhood.The Chinese houseboy, married (arrived in Canada in 1913 leaving family in Hong Kong) 25- or 27-year-old Wong Foon Sing, became infatuated with Smith, giving her presents such as a silk nightdress. Although her friends would later testify that she feared him, her diary would reveal that she enjoyed attracting men.


== Death and lack of an investigation ==
On 26 July 1924, Point Grey Police Constable James Green was called to the house. Wong claimed he heard what sounded like a car backfire; in the basement he found Smith's body. There was a bullet wound through her temple and a .45 caliber revolver near her right hand.Green picked up the weapon, making it impossible to obtain fingerprints from it. Despite there being no bullet, blood or brain tissue on the walls, no powder burns on her face, and the fact that the back of her head had been smashed in, Green concluded that she had committed suicide. After an inquest, the Vancouver coroner called it a ""self-inflicted but accidental death.""Undertakers were summoned, and instructed by both the coroner and the police to embalm the body, likely eradicating any clues that it might have yielded, for instance whether Smith had been sexually assaulted. It was the first time the undertaker had embalmed the victim of a violent death without a postmortem. He found unexplained burns on Smith's right side. Smith was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in the 1919 section bordered by 41st Ave and Prince Edward Street.


== Reopening of the case ==
Smith's friends contacted the recently formed United Council of Scottish Societies, which pressured the provincial government and Attorney General Alexander Malcolm Manson to reopen the case. The Vancouver Star, a scandal sheet published by Victor Odlum, was quick to pounce on the affair. An additional inducement for Odlum was that an enemy of his, General A. D. McRae, was the father of Frederick Baker's sister-in-law.The body was exhumed on 28 August and a second inquest held. This time the jury concluded that Smith had been murdered. Manson appointed a special prosecutor, Malcolm Bruce Jackson.Suspicion immediately fell on Wong, the only other person in the house (other than the Bakers' baby, Rosemary) when the crime was supposedly committed.  The Star published several articles in late July and early August in which it had portrayed Wong as the likely killer.


== Proposed legislation ==
Odlum was an ""exclusionist""; he believed that Asians could not assimilate with whites and had run on an anti-Asian platform in the 1921 federal election. On 8 August, he published an editorial called ""Should Chinese Work with White Girls? He called for legislation to ""preserve white girls of impressionable youth from the unnecessary wiles and villainies of low caste yellow men.""Popular Member of the Legislative Assembly Mary Ellen Smith introduced the ""Janet Smith Bill"" in November. It would have prohibited the employing of Orientals and white women in the same household. The Vancouver Province pointed out that it violated the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of 1911 (which prohibited discriminatory legislation against Japanese) and that the British Columbia legislature did not have the authority to pass it. It failed after a second reading.


== Kidnapping ==
Interest gradually died down, until on 20 March 1925, Wong was kidnapped by a group of men dressed in Ku Klux Klan robes. They proceeded to torture their captive for six weeks, trying to elicit a confession, but Wong refused to cooperate. On 1 May, he was released.
A scandal later developed when it was discovered that the kidnappers included ""two Point Grey police commissioners, the chief of police, a detective sergeant and three prominent officials of the city’s Scottish societies."" The group had also enlisted the translation services of Wong Foon Sien, whose participation elicited outrage amongst both Chinese Canadians and Anglophones in the community because he was also working for a detective agency investigating the case. One man pleaded guilty to kidnapping. A detective and his son were also convicted, but the jury gave a ""strong recommendation of mercy"". The Point Grey policemen were acquitted, and the government controversially barred prosecution of the others.As it turned out, Manson knew where Wong was being held, but did nothing about it, hoping that the torture would solve the case. Instead, Manson's career was severely damaged by the revelation of his inaction.


== Trial ==
Meanwhile, Wong was put on trial for murder. In October, the case was thrown out of court due to lack of evidence. Wong went back to work for the Bakers. In 1926, he left the country for Hong Kong or China.


== Other suspects ==
Other theories gained popularity. According to one rumor, Smith had been raped and murdered at a wild party at the Baker house by wealthy playboys, who then bribed the authorities to cover it up. Writer Ed Starkins proposed Frederick Baker as the killer, portraying him as a drug smuggler.

358,VIVO Media Arts Centre,"VIVO Media Arts Centre, run under the Satellite Video Exchange Society, (SVES) is an artist-run centre and video distribution library located in Vancouver, Canada.  It was founded in 1973 to promote the non-commercial use of video technology by providing international and educational video exchange through a public video library. Its mission has then been expanded to provide equipment rentals, artist workshops, and provide information to the public about media arts.


== History ==
A group of artists interested in video met at the  Matrix Video Conference, held at the Vancouver Art Gallery in 1973. Organized by Michael Goldberg and Trish Hardman, the conference encouraged depositing a videotape and filling out a Video Exchange Directory card.  Shawn Preus and Paul Wong were recruited to work on the collection, and  this became the base of a video library. Shortly after the conference, The Satellite Video Exchange Society was founded (incorporated in 1973), and included a publicly accessible video library; the space later became known as the Video Inn.  Its space became a sort of ""drop-in"" where artistic and other communities came together, and included viewing spaces and tape selves. Starting out as Intermedia, VIVO is an early Canadian example of an artist-run centre, and exhibited the characteristics of the tentative beginnings of the artist-run centre and the development of new forms of art making that such centres generated.


=== Intermedia ===
Intermedia existed between 1967-72 in Vancouver, and served as an umbrella organization for diverse interdisciplinary practices including performance, music, poetry, happenings, dance, cooking, photography, filmmaking, fashion, sculpture, music and video.  A priority towards ephemeral art, much was staged outside of institutional spaces. Many were inspired and participated in Intermedia's events, including General Idea, where AA Bronson details,""inspired by Canada's first artist-run centre, the unbeatable, unforgettable, indescribable wonder that was Intermedia (where Jorge performed his first art performance in Vancouver in l968).""  While Intermedia dissolved in 1972, it played a role in the denial of becoming a constrained institutional directive.  Many independent organizations and spaces came out of Intermedia, most notably a direct link to what is now VIVO Media Art Centre.


== Programming ==
VIVO Media Arts Centre facilitates various programming structures including events, exhibitions, artist and curatorial residencies, and media workshops and has hosted festivals such as Vancouver New Music Festival, and LIVE (performance) Biennale in 2015.  The space has hosted artists and curators such as Noxious Sector, Paul Wong, Stacey Ho, Jayce Salloum, Hank Bull, Abbas Akhavan, Elizabeth MacKenzie and Marina Roy.


=== Crista Dahl Media Library & Archive ===
VIVO is home to the Crista Dahl Media Library & Archive (CDMLA) Canada’s most significant repositories of video by artists and independent producers. It includes over 5000 video titles, an extensive publication and textual record collection, a photo archive, and the societal records of its parent organization - the Satellite Video Exchange Society (SVES). The Archive safeguards video collections chronicling unique B.C. histories including those of Metro Media, The Women’s Labour History Project, The First Nations Access Program, Vancouver Status of Women,  GaybleVision, Operation Solidarity, and Women in Focus. Crista Dahl, after whom the archive and library is named, is a long-standing SVES member and VIVO volunteer (former board chairperson, board member, and volunteer archivist). Dahl's involvement  with the organization began from her involvement Intermedia in the 1970s. She supported Michael Goldberg with international video exchange projects which resulted in the Matrix Video Conference tape exchange and eight International Video Exchange Directories (1971 to 1981)—all of which form the basis of the current collection. A tireless volunteer with a natural affinity to archiving, Crista Dahl has been described as a ""visionary volunteer archivist.""

The open park, sometimes referred to as a linear park, is located underneath the SkyTrain Expo Line, and was one of the dozens of open parks built in 1986 as part of BC Transit's Parkway Program showcasing different cultural parks on the 26-kilometre path that parallels the SkyTrain. Many ethnic communities created legacies on the linear park under the Skytrain in 1986.Highly visible in the front of the park are a wooden arch, a very distinctive-colorful Sarimanok logo, and 2 walls made up of 2,000 red bricks donated by Filipino-Canadians representing the pioneers of the  plaza.Construction of the park was made possible with the bayanihan spirit of Filipino-Canadian members of the ""Filipino Plaza Committee of 1985.""

360,RCAF Station Jericho Beach,"RCAF Station Jericho Beach, originally known as the Jericho Beach Air Station, was one of the first Canadian air stations opened by the Canadian Air Board. Jericho Beach is located in Vancouver, British Columbia.


== History ==
Jericho Beach began operation in 1920 as a flying boat station, one of several that would open along the British Columbia coast.  Federal and provincial government departments used the aircraft based here for civil roles such as anti-smuggling, fishery, and forestry patrols, and transportation to remote communities. Some of the aircraft used at Jericho Beach since 1920 included the Curtiss HS-2L, Canadian Vickers Vancouver, Canadian Vickers Vedette, and Stranraer.
The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) took over Jericho Beach in 1924, and the station was renamed ""RCAF Station Jericho Beach."" No. 4 and No. 6 Bomber Reconnaissance Squadrons, and No. 1 Signal Squadron began operating from the station. In 1930, the RCAF used Jericho Beach as their centre for seaplane and flying boat training. By 1940, the seaplane squadrons had moved to RCAF Station Sea Island, and No. 3 Operational Training Unit (OTU) began operations, training aircrew on flying boats. No. 3 Repair Depot was also established in 1940, and along with No. 3 OTU, would remain until 1945. 
In 1942 the army's Pacific Command Headquarters moved to Jericho Beach, and in 1947, the army took control of the station. There remained, however, a small RCAF presence. Over the years, the station hosted many other army and Canadian Forces units. Most of the base facilities were transferred to the City of Vancouver in 1969, and the area renamed ""Jericho Park.""Jericho Beach detachment was closed in 1996. Most of the base's buildings, including the old flying boat hangars, have been taken down. The few that remain and are being used for non-military purposes.

361,Italian Cultural Centre Vancouver,"The Italian Cultural Centre (Il Centro) is located at 3075 Slocan Street, in East Vancouver, Canada, on Slocan Street at Grandview Highway. The centre is noted to host a bar, multiple classrooms and various groups. Anna Foschi Ciampolini, as the coordinator, organized the conference at the centre that founded the Association of Italian-Canadian Writers. At its gate is a welded sculpture called Pagan by Italian sculptor Severino Trinca.


== History ==
The Italian Cultural Centre's beginnings are in 1974 when the Consul General of Italy, Giovanni Germano, met with the Premier of British Columbia, Dave Barret. In the Provincial Legislature the Premier represented the riding of Vancouver-Hastings, an area heavily inhabited by Canadians of Italian origin. The Premier was well aware of the wish of the Italian community and he therefore challenged Consul Germano to find the support and turn the dream into a reality. Premier Barret assured Consul Germano that a grant from the B.C. Government would be available. At Vancouver City Hall, Mayor Art Phillips, also well aware of the wish of the Italian community, indicated to Consul Germano the possibility of obtaining city land at a special price. The land had already been chosen: an 8-acre (32,000 m2) city dump in the heart of Vancouver East.
Both the Provincial Government and the City of Vancouver kept their promise. In order to draw a wider participation of members, a Federation of Italian Associations was formed on a Canadian legal basis: the Italian Folk Society, later to become the Italian Cultural Centre Society. The original societies pertaining to the Federation were the following: Associazione Nazionale Alpini, Circolo Abruzzese, Coro Italiano della British Columbia, Famee Furlane, Famiglia Bagnolese, Italian Canadian Rod & Gun Club, Italian Mutual Aid Society, Molisana Society, Selva del Montello, Sicilian Club, Società Culturale Vicentini, St. Jude Italian Society and Tuscany Cultural Society. These 13 were the founding societies. Today there are 37  societies affiliated to the Italian Cultural Centre.


=== Opening 1977 ===
On September 25, 1977, the Italian Cultural Centre officially opened its doors. The former city dump became an address in Vancouver where the Italian community could gather with the aim to preserve, develop and express Italian culture and language.Il Centro functions as an orientation and service centre for incoming Italian immigrants as well as a community centre for the Italian-Canadian community.
The centre's services are a restaurant, museum, library, banquet hall, daycare centre, television production centre and an indoor bocce court. Every summer in June the centre hosts a week-long Italian festival called Italian Week.
As part of their initiatives to preserve Italian Culture for not only the Italian community, but to promote Italian culture in Vancouver. This is done through offering Italian language classes for young and old, fine art exhibitions, wine tastings, cooking classes, Literary events, and the organization of Italia day on Commercial Drive and Il Mercato in order to showcase Italian culture and Italian business in Vancouver. 
In 1977  ""The Drive"" (Commercial Drive) between Venables and 12th Avenue was very much a ""Little Italy"" with mainly Italian cafes and restaurants. By 1997 it was noted that the area had become ethnically more diverse though The Italian Cultural Centre was still the hub of a thriving Italian community.


== Sports facilities ==
Adjoining the main building, the centre has an indoor bocce court.
According to Boccemon Tom McNutt ""The Italian Cultural Centre in Vancouver, British Columbia has one of the finest bocce facilities on the continent. It is a great institution and every culture would be proud to have such a treasure.""


== Il Museo ==
The Italian Cultural Centre, Vancouver also houses a museum called Il Museo. The mission of Il Museo is to be a living narrative of the contributions of pioneer and contemporary Italians and their institutions in Vancouver and beyond. Il Museo at the Italian Cultural Centre in Vancouver tells the varied and vibrant stories of Italians in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia from 1890 to the present day. The Museum's curator is Angela Clarke.
In June, Il Museo will host an exhibition of renowned Italian-Canadian architect Bruno Freschi.


== Redevelopment proposal 2017 ==
Leading up to 2017 a redevelopment was proposed where three new buildings would be connected through piazzas and atriums, replacing the parking lot with underground parking. The proposal is still in discussion.

362,Hastings Racecourse,"Hastings Racecourse is a horse racing facility at Hastings Park, four miles from downtown Vancouver. Originally called East Park, it opened for business in 1889, making it Vancouver's longest continuously used professional sports facility. The racing operation is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of the Great Canadian Gaming Corporation which acquired the lease of the city-owned track in 2004.

In September, the two most important races for three-year-olds in British Columbia, the British Columbia Oaks and the British Columbia Derby, are run at Hastings Racecourse.
On May 18, 2011 it was reported that the course could close at the end of its 2012 lease due to low profits from wagering revenue and slots as well as difficulty reaching an agreeable new lease with the city.

At that time, the land was unstable for development.  The first non-native settlers purchased a lot on the 22nd avenue and built there.
By 1927, the area was served by three streetcar routes. Dunbar–Southlands became part of Vancouver in 1929 when the Municipality of Point Grey merged with the City of Vancouver.
The first major land development in Dunbar–Southlands taken place in the mid-1920s and some of the homes built during this period still stand today.

It is named after John Oliver, the Premier of British Columbia from 1918 to 1927. The school is composed of four main segments: the main building (""A"" Building) containing the bulk of the learning areas, including the Auditorium and Learning Commons; a wooden building (""B"" Building) affectionately nicknamed ""The Barn"", due to its appearance, which is closed but was previously used by the mini school and Digital Immersion students; a Drama Studio (""C"" Building) which allows for several theatre and acting courses; and a concrete building — the engineering building — bisected by a breezeway, with automotive, metal, and wood shops.

== History ==
The school was originally called South Vancouver High School and began in 1912 as two surplus classrooms on the grounds of Lord Selkirk Elementary at 22nd Avenue and Commercial Street. The following year, when enrolment jumped from 58 to 148, the high school students moved to General Gordon School, which is today known as Sir Sanford Fleming Elementary, located at 49th Avenue and Knight Street. Enrolment continued to increase and a site for a purpose-built high school was chosen near 41st Avenue and Fraser Street, adjacent to the South Vancouver municipal hall and fire station. South Vancouver's first, stand-alone high school was built in 1920, and was opened on January 21, 1921 by its new namesake, the Honourable John Oliver, then Premier of BC. By 1926, the enrolment of the school was over 900, and a second building with an additional 8 rooms was built to the west of the main building, on 43rd Ave. This new building, now called ""The Barn"", is still in existence today. The main part of the current school building was erected in 1950 on 41st Avenue, with the subsequent addition and expansion of technical studies shops, cafeteria and music wing during the following years. The original building burnt down on December 9, 1959.

368,West Vancouver Memorial Library,"The West Vancouver Memorial Library (WVML) is a public library that serves the District of West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.


== Early history ==
The library was founded in 1950 as a memorial to honour those who gave their lives during World War II so future generations would have the freedom to pursue knowledge without let or hindrance.
Although West Vancouver Memorial Library did not officially open its doors until November 11, 1950, the District of West Vancouver was peppered with small circulating libraries throughout the first half of the twentieth century.  As early as 1919, Mrs. Effie M. Field was loaning books from her dry goods and children's clothing store at 14th St. and Bellevue Ave.; however, in 1921, the Hollyburn Public Library Association took over Mrs. Field's modest collection of books, with the intention of turning it into a municipally funded public library.  By 1926, the library's collection grew to over 1000 books, and after moving into George Gimmill's modern drug store at 1402 Marine Dr., the library was able to expand even further.

Harsh economic times during the 1930s led to sharp reductions in provincial funding, and in 1933, the library was officially closed.  West Vancouver residents were deeply affected by the Great Depression, although throughout the latter half of the decade, there was a proliferation of small private lending libraries in a number of stationery and gift shops.
With the onset of the Second World War, the economy of West Vancouver was centered on the War effort, along with the rest of Canada, but by the summer of 1944, a petition requesting the establishment of a municipal public library was presented to West Vancouver City Council.  On December 16, the by-law was approved, and shortly after the end of the War, the municipality voted that a library be constructed as a War Memorial.


=== Later history ===
Designed by West Vancouver architect R. A. D. Berwick, the library was opened on November 11, 1950 with Elizabeth Musto as the library's first official librarian. Shortly thereafter, a stained glass window was generously donated to the library, featuring a reproduction of a painting by Sir Frank Bernard Dicksee entitled ""Harmony,"" created by Master craftsman John Henry Dearle.
West Vancouver Memorial Library was only narrowly voted in as the municipality's official War Memorial; second (by only one vote) was a Civic Center. Other possibilities included a hospital, a swimming pool, a chapel, a town clock, and a community gymnasium. The library is situated in the 1900 block of Marine Dr., and since it was officially opened in the year 1950, it was given the street number 1950 by the municipality.
Since the end of the War, West Vancouver's population had risen steadily, and after just five years of being open, the library was circulating 12.76 books per capita.  In 1957, Weekend Magazine published a photostory about West Vancouver Memorial Library entitled ""North America's Busiest Library"", and in 1960, The Vancouver Sun also proclaimed that the library was the ""Most Busy Library in Canada"".

370,New Brighton Park,"Located in the Hastings-Sunrise district of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, New Brighton Park is a waterfront park facing the North Shore Mountains with beach access to the Burrard Inlet. The park is surrounded by industrial plants, the Hastings Racecourse, as well as access to the Port of Vancouver. During the summer, the park becomes a popular location for recreational activity. There is a soccer pitch, tennis courts, barbecue/picnic sites, two playgrounds, beaches, and an outdoor pool. For local residents, New Brighton Park provides a nearby location with similar facilities found at other popular recreational parks such as Kitsilano Beach, which is located on the west side of Vancouver. New Brighton Park is also in the process of being connected to Hastings Park via Creekway Park, which will allow people to walk and cycle between the two locations.


== History ==
New Brighton was previously known as Hastings Townsite back in 1865, and is considered to be the original area in which Vancouver began.  To recognize the significance of this area, the City of Vancouver laid a plaque in 1968 indicating that this area was where the first outlets were established in the city. These outlets included the first post office, roads, playing field, Canadian Pacific Railway office, docks, and museum. The plaque also reads that Hasting Townsite was the most fashionable watering place in all of British Columbia. The plaque reads Here Vancouver Began. All was forest towering to the skies. British Royal Engineers surveyed it into lots, 1863, and named the area ""Hastings Townsite"" to honour Admiral Hastings, British Navy. Everything Began at Hastings. The first post office, customs, road, bridge, hotel, stable, telegraph, dock, ferry, playing field, museum, C.P.R. offices. It was the most fashionable watering place in British Columbia. New Brighton Park. Retains the name of a hotel built here in 1880 known as the new ""Brighton House"".

Pools used the salt water from Burrard Inlet.  Lumbermans Arch, 2nd Beach, and Windermere pool were all 1/2 circle concrete pools until the 1970s when they were converted to freshwater pools.
These pools were all free to use until the conversions, when fees were introduced.


== New Brighton Pool ==

New Brighton Pool is a public outdoor pool that is usually open from May to September. The pool features 25-meter swim lanes as well as a sloped or beach style entry for young children, inexperienced swimmers, and visitors using wheelchairs. Lessons and classes are also available during the summer season.


== Dog walking ==

New Brighton Park is also a dog-friendly park. There are specific areas in the park where dogs are allowed to be off-leash. This is between Windermere Street and Nootka Street, and E Waterfront Road. Dogs are allowed to be off-leash between May 1 to September 30 from 5:00 am to 10:00 pm and between October 1 to April 30 from 5:00 am to 10:00 pm.


== Sewage overflow ==

New Brighton Park is one of the many locations in Vancouver, Burnaby, and New Westminster, that sewage outflow occurs. Vancouver's current sewage system was built in the 1960s and is organized so that sewage output is mixed with rainwater collecting systems. This is known as a combined sewer system. The reason for implementing such a system is that it is both cheaper to build and easier to maintain. Under normal circumstances this system is not an issue. However, when storms produce large amounts of rainwater the system overflows to nearby waterways.  In most cases the piping is under water so that the public cannot see that sewage leaving, however, at New Brighton Park the piping is sometimes exposed at low tide.
There have recently been some concerns raised about this current system in Vancouver due to the effects of climate change. It is predicted that rainfall rates will increase in the lower mainland due to changes in climate and this could cause an increase in the amount of overflow water being routed to the ocean. For this reason, Vancouver has committed to the gradual change from a combined sewer system to a separated sewer system by 2050. This would mean that only excess rainwater collected from streets and houses would be directed towards the ocean and all sewage would be processed by sewage treatment plants.

376,Pacific National Exhibition,"The Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) is a non profit organization which hosts an annual 17-day summer fair, seasonal amusement park, and arena in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It usually begins in mid-to-late August, and ends in early September, usually Labour Day.
Other than the fair, Hastings Park is also the home of Playland amusement park, a horse racetrack (which also bears the name Hastings Park), the Pacific Coliseum (an ice hockey arena), the PNE Forum, and the PNE Agrodome. It was the site of Empire Stadium, which was demolished and replaced with a public soccer field. It is also the location of Hastings Skatepark, a skateboard bowl located to the south of the Pacific Coliseum.
In 2020, the fair was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic in the province.  Many other agricultural and county fairs across Canada including the Calgary Stampede, K-Days and the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto were also cancelled that year.


== History ==

The exhibition has been held in Hastings Park since it first took place in 1910. It was opened by then Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier as the Industrial Exhibition. The biggest attractions of the two-week fair are its numerous shops, stalls, performances, a nightly fireworks show, and the PNE Prize Home. The PNE has played an important role in the history of Vancouver. From its beginnings as a showcase for the region's agriculture and economy, it has grown immensely. This growth has resulted in many questions about the fair's future at Hastings Park. 
From 1942 to 1946 the PNE was closed and like the Canadian National Exhibition served as a military training facility for the duration of World War II. During this time, the PNE barns, used to house livestock, were used to intern & process Japanese Canadians from all over British Columbia. Here, they were imprisoned, and/or shipped off to other internment camps throughout British Columbia, and Alberta. The Momiji (Japanese word for Maple) Gardens, on the PNE grounds, serve as a reminder and memorial for this dark chapter in Canadian history. The barns themselves are still used to house livestock during the annual fair, and serve as storage area to house some of the PNE's property the rest of the year.

The highest attendance at the fair was recorded in 1986, with 1.1 million guests visiting the PNE, most likely due to Expo '86 that was occurring at the time. The PNE was once the second largest fair after the New York State Fair.During 1997-1998, the PNE grounds was transformed with the demolition of a number of buildings including the Food Building, Showmart and the Poultry Building. This gave way to the Sanctuary, a parkland setting with a pond. The pond restored part of a stream that once flowed in the park out to the Burrard Inlet. The city restored a large portion of the park. Many old fair buildings have been demolished and replaced by a more natural character. Although land was purchased in Surrey that was to become the fair's new home, the PNE has since transferred ownership from the province to the City of Vancouver and will remain at Hastings Park. The PNE is a registered charity.
Two attractions at the PNE were named as heritage sites by the City of Vancouver in August 2013. The Pacific Coliseum and the Wooden Roller Coaster were added to the list.


== List of buildings and structures ==
Following the plans to revitalize Hastings Park, many of the PNE's historic buildings were demolished.
A list of the buildings and structures now used for the PNE:


=== Memorial ===
A memorial located on the park grounds is dedicated to the 29th (Tobin's Tigers) Canadian Infantry Battalion, CEF, later perpetuated by the Irish Fusiliers of Canada (the Vancouver Regiment) and the British Columbia Regiment (DCO) since the merger of the two regiments.


=== Demolished buildings ===


== Transportation ==

Early fair goers arrived by streetcar (until 1955) via Renfrew Street. Today, the park can be reached by car (with a parking lot to the north west, north east, south east, and one south which is across the street from Playland's entrance) and public transit.
Historic Miller Drive, which runs east to west through the grounds, is a city street. Renfrew Street and Hastings Street form the west and south boundaries of the park.
The PNE has a number of gateways used as entrances for the fair. They include:

377,Corkscrew (Playland),"Corkscrew was a steel roller coaster located at Playland At the PNE amusement park in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  It is famous for its appearance in the 2006 motion picture Final Destination 3 (known in the movie as Devil's Flight) and the 2012 motion picture Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days, as well as the popular television series Smallville (season three's ""Magnetic""). The bonus disc of the Final Destination 3 DVD set includes behind the scenes footage shot on and around the coaster, documenting the challenges involved in shooting the complex scenes.
As of March 2019, it is no longer listed on the park’s website, and has been sold to an un-announced purchaser. 


== History ==
Vekoma of the Netherlands originally built the ride in 1985 for Boblo Island park in Amherstburg, Ontario, Canada. The corkscrew concept was introduced by Arrow Dynamics in 1975 with a roller coaster that now operates at Silverwood in Idaho. Several models can be found throughout the world, some with additional inversions such as a vertical loop.

378,Wooden Roller Coaster (Playland),"The Wooden Roller Coaster is a wooden roller coaster at Playland in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Opened in 1958, it is the oldest roller coaster in Canada. The ride is 2,840 ft (870 m) long—which established it as the largest roller coaster in Canada at the time it was completed—and has a height of 68 ft (21 m) and speeds of up to 76 km/h (47 mph). The coaster was awarded the Coaster Classic and Roller Coaster Landmark statuses by American Coaster Enthusiasts.


== History ==
The Wooden Roller Coaster opened in 1958. At the time, it cost over $200,000 to make, and was 40 cents for guests to ride. Designed by Carl Phare and Walker LeRoy, the ride was the final design of Phare's career, and is his only creation that is still standing.


== In film and television ==
The Coaster was featured in the movie Riding the Bullet and was the ""Bullet"". It also made a brief appearance in the teenage thriller Fear.

381,Creekway Park,"Creekway Park is a small daylighting habitat located in the Hastings-Sunrise area of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The park, which is located at 2957 Bridgeway Street just southeast of New Brighton Park between McGill Street and the railway tracks, was completed in September 2013 as the first stage of the Vancouver City Council's plan to eventually connect New Brighton Park with Hastings Park. This would provide a passage for water from the sanctuary at Hastings Park to the Burrard Inlet. Although the connection is not fully complete, Creekway Park still has a running stream with pedestrian and bicycle paths that connect to the Trans Canada Trail. Once the project has been fully completed, there will be a pathway between Hastings Park, Creekway Park, and New Brighton Park. This will also promote an urban habitat that supports all kinds of wildlife such as birds, fish, butterflies, and amphibians, as well as many native plant species.

382,East Vancouver,"East Vancouver (also called ""East Van"" or the ""East Side"") is a region within the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Geographically, East Vancouver is bordered to the north by Burrard Inlet, to the south by the Fraser River, and to the east by the city of Burnaby. East Vancouver is divided from Vancouver's ""West Side"" (not to be confused with the ""West End"" of Downtown Vancouver or with West Vancouver) by Ontario St (although Main Street is used as a metonym as the nearest arterial road).
East Vancouver has been the first home for many non-British immigrants since the 1880s. Historically, it was also a more affordable area and traditionally the home for many lower-income working class. The East Side is best summarized by its diversity – in family income, land use, ethnicity and mother tongue. The rapid increase in housing prices and gentrification may be affecting diversity of the area.


== History ==


=== Colonization: 1860 - 1945 ===
In 1860, the False Creek Trail was built alongside a trail used by Indigenous peoples to connect False Creek with New Westminster, traversing the region of East Vancouver. The first colonial settlement in the current Metro Vancouver area appeared in 1865 in what is now Strathcona, Vancouver's first neighbourhood. Similarly to the present, Strathcona was known simply as the ""East End"". In the 1880s, colonists built homes in what is now Mount Pleasant.Construction of North Arm Road (now Fraser Street) began in 1872 to allow farmers to bring their produce to market from the north arm of the Fraser River. Later, in 1890, a railway linked South Vancouver and Mount Pleasant. Besides agriculture, canneries were a major employer for many residents in the 1880s and 1890s.

In 1886, the City of Vancouver was incorporated, comprising much of East Vancouver. One exception was the municipality of South Vancouver, created in 1892, which was an independent municipality until 1929. In 1888, the provincial government designated 65 hectares of land adjacent to modern Hastings Street as a park, now known as Hastings Park. Since 1907, the park has been home to the Pacific National Exhibition.
Transportation infrastructure expanded during the 1890s. In 1891, four public houses opened along Kingsway to service stagecoaches and carriages. Hourly tramcar service began operating along a right-of-way parallel to and crossing where the False Creek Trail had existed. In 1913, it was paved and renamed Kingsway. By the 1920s, street car service was installed along the full length of what is now designated Main Street.
Development of the area increased during the turn of the century. In 1893, a small cedar cottage was built near present-day Kingsway and Knight Street. In 1900, the Cedar Cottage Brewery was built near this location and the surrounding area is still known as ""Cedar Cottage."" In 1911, a municipal hall was built at the intersection of East 41st Avenue and Fraser Street, while the Hastings Sawmill lands were sold to the local working class. In the following year, John Oliver High School was built nearby. The Collingwood Free Library also opened in the neighbourhood. This library was built largely due to donations from a local resident, John Francis Bursill, who wrote for local newspapers under the name ""Felix Penne"".
Electricity was first provided to South Vancouver in 1914, with one of the first street lights in Vancouver being installed at East 48th Avenue and Nanaimo Street. In the aftermath of the First World War, a building boom occurred in many areas of East Vancouver, resulting in much of the region being occupied by single-family housing by the 1940s.
John Hendry Park was established to contain Trout Lake in 1926 when Mrs. Aldene Hamber purchased and donated the land to the City of Vancouver in order to prevent it from conversion to a municipal landfill. A condition of the donation was that the park be named after her father, John Hendry, and maintained by the city government.
In 1939, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Vancouver, traveling in a royal procession down Knight Street, and making an unplanned stop in the neighbourhood of Collingwood.


=== After World War II ===
In 1947, many farmers were displaced in South Vancouver to open residential land for returning World War II veterans and their families.
During the 1950s, residents requested that the city government clear vegetation around Trout Lake to prevent skinny dipping. Tram service in the Lower Mainland was terminated in 1954 due to increasing automobile ownership and bus service. In 1955, an editorial in The Province implied that it favoured large areas of Strathcona and Chinatown being demolished in favour of new development.
In the 1960s, sidewalk paving was completed in East Vancouver, three decades after wooden planked sidewalks were removed. In the late 60s, Non-Partisan Association mayor Tom ""Terrific"" Campbell advocated a freeway that would demolish much of Chinatown. Campbell also advocated demolishing the historic Carnegie Centre and building a luxury hotel at the entrance of Stanley Park. In 1967, a US-based firm proposed a waterfront freeway, which would have required that 600 Strathcona houses be demolished and a 10-metre-high overpass be built over the centre of Chinatown. Widespread protest, including a crowd of 800 people who protested the proposals at City Hall, led to the resignation of the chairman of the city's planning commission and the end of the proposal a year later.
1971 - Strict development regulations were passed to limit development in Chinatown and save the architectural heritage. This also preserved the community from proposed massive freeway projects.
1972 - Vancouver city mayor Thomas Campbell (NPA) was defeated by Art Phillips of (The Electors Action Movement). Phillips and TEAM campaigned on rehabilitating Gastown, whereas the NPA slate tended to strongly support the failed freeway project through East Vancouver.
1985 - The SkyTrain rapid transit system (current Expo Line) was built to connect downtown Vancouver to Surrey and included five stations in East Vancouver.
1986 - The City hosted a World's Fair (Expo 86) on the old rail yard properties at False Creek. Residential densification began to accelerate in this area.
1986 to 1993 - The Non-Partisan Association returned to Vancouver City Hall, with former realtor and businessman Gordon Campbell as mayor. The NPA worked more closely with developers, passing a series of pro-development by-laws.  Many seniors and poor renters are evicted from properties throughout the city, including Gastown.
1994 - The lease expired on the Pacific National Exhibition grounds at Hastings Park. Extensions were granted by Vancouver City Council. The final year for the Exhibition was to be 1997, 100 years after it started operating in Hastings Park.
2002 - The Millennium Line of SkyTrain opened, providing new rapid transit service through East Vancouver.
2004 - The provincial government transferred authority for the PNE to the City of Vancouver. A consultation process was initiated to determine a new future for the PNE in Hastings Park.


== Neighbourhoods, demographics and languages ==
The 2001 census identified almost 550,000 in the city of Vancouver (Metro Vancouver has about 2.25 million residents).

The City of Vancouver identifies seven communities as being entirely in the East Vancouver area: Grandview-Woodland, Hastings-Sunrise, Kensington-Cedar Cottage, Killarney, Renfrew-Collingwood, Strathcona and Victoria-Fraserview. The 2001 census identified 220,490 people living in these communities (approximately 40% of the city's population).
Two communities, Mount Pleasant and Riley Park-Little Mountain, straddle both East Vancouver and the West Side.
Two communities are part of East Vancouver but often referred to separately because of their unique place in the city's fabric: the Downtown Eastside and Chinatown.
In addition to East Vancouver, the City of Vancouver is made up of the West End, Downtown, Downtown Eastside, and West Side. The Downtown area is further differentiated into Coal Harbour, Yaletown, Gastown, and other semi-distinct regions.
While the overall mother tongue in the City of Vancouver is 49% English and 26% Chinese (2001), areas of East Vancouver represent a more diverse ethnic population (e.g. residents of Victoria-Fraserview identified their mother tongue as 27% English and 49% Chinese). Note that all other mother tongues (e.g., Punjabi) were identified by fewer than 3% each of the City's population.


== Community identity ==
East Vancouver has a strong geographic and community identity. This identity is about a diverse community living together within a dynamic urban neighbourhood. This diverse identity is strengthened by many active ethnic communities, a vibrant artistic presence, a politically engaged youth population, and vocal sexual-orientation and gender-identity groups.
The political identity of the community is reinforced by newspapers such as the Republic of East Vancouver newspaper (the name of which invokes a long-time joking reference to the left-leaning nature of the community and its labour history) and frequent political and social activism - such as the Commercial Drive Car Free Festival and protests.The artistic identity is reinforced by events at the Vancouver East Cultural Centre, a community poetry anthology (""East of Main""), the Eastside Culture Crawl, and ""the Drift"", an annual event where local artists present their work centred around Main Street.
While many East Vancouver residents are proud of the diversity in their community, some perceive a long prejudice against East Side neighbourhoods. These concerns include the protests against the 1960s effort to push a freeway through (and over) parts of the East Side, to a perception that municipal spending and planning favours other areas of the city (especially the West Side), to recent debates, such as expansion of the Port of Vancouver operation in East Vancouver and the expansion of the Port Mann bridge and predicted increased traffic through the East Side.
Mayor Sam Sullivan's plans for increased population in Vancouver with ""ecodensity"" includes coach houses and densification plans via zoning changes mainly for the East Side, with few plans to change zoning or densify the West Side.


== Ethnic communities ==

Immigrant waves that passed through East Vancouver include English, Welsh, Irish, Scottish, Italians, German, Eastern European, Chinese, South East Asian, South Asian.


=== European ethnicities ===
Early European settlers in East Vancouver were largely Irish, English, Scottish and Welsh. Today, evidence of these early settlers from Britain and Ireland is found in places such as the Cambrian Hall (built 1929) for the first Welsh Society in Vancouver (est. 1908).  Modern British/Irish communities are still active in East Vancouver today, notably at the WISE Hall (""WISE"" is an acronym for Welsh-Irish-Scottish-English) and the Vancouver Irish Céili Society.
Italian immigrants formed the first ""Little Italy"" in the Main Street area by 1910 and then the Commercial Drive area in the 1950s (where Italian businesses and residents are still plentiful). An Italian Cultural Centre opened nearby on the Grandview Highway in the 1970s.  Italian commercial and cultural life is also prevalent on Hastings around Nanaimo, and from there eastwards into the Burnaby Heights region of North Burnaby.
While Greek immigrants mostly moved to Vancouver's West Side (e.g. Hellenic Cultural Community Centre on Arbutus Street) there were also strong communities in East Vancouver, particularly near Boundary Road (which divides Vancouver from the eastern municipality, Burnaby). In the 1960s, the number of Greek immigrants to Vancouver doubled in the 1960s, although this has declined steadily since the late 1960s.
Other visible European communities that have settled in East Vancouver include Polish (e.g. the Polish Veterans Association Meeting Hall on Kingsway, the Polish Hall on Fraser Street), German (Alpine Club of Canada hall on Victoria Drive), Croatian (the Croatian Cultural Centre near Trout Lake, the Croatian Catholic Church on 1st Avenue) and Hungarian (the Hungarian Cultural Society's centre on Kingsway at Fraser, and the St. Elizabeth of Hungary Catholic Church on E. 7th at Commercial Drive).


=== East Asian ===
 
A Chinese community existed before Vancouver was incorporated (1886) and shortly after that date became established at today's Chinatown in the eastern part of Downtown Vancouver. Chinese immigration to the city grew significantly after 1947 when racial immigration exclusion laws were removed by the BC Government. Since the 1980s, many Chinese immigrants now choose to live outside of Chinatown, including elsewhere in East Vancouver (e.g. Kingsway St. and Victoria Dr. areas) and Richmond. Immigrants from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan began to move to the Vancouver area from the 1990s, concerned about the transfer of the territory from the UK to the Chinese. These immigrants were often wealthier than previous waves of Chinese immigrants and typically moved to non-Chinese communities in the West Side and elsewhere.
Chinese remains the dominant ethnicity in the City of Vancouver (about 33% of the city's students learn Chinese prior to learning English). Metro Vancouver has North America's highest percentage of residents of Chinese descent (16%) and of this, 80% are foreign-born.A wave of immigrants from South East Asian countries (e.g. Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam) has moved to East Vancouver since the 1970s. Although many of these new immigrants have since relocated to City of Richmond as part of the ""Asia West"" movement. Kingsway Street in East Vancouver has many South East Asian businesses, such as Vietnamese restaurants, cafes and beauty shops. In 2003, about 5% of Vancouver's students speak Vietnamese as their first language.Asian communities are served in East Vancouver by the Cantonese Families Mutual Sharing and Support Group and the Vietnamese Seniors Outreach Program, both on Commercial Drive.


=== South Asian ===
South Asians have been present in Vancouver since at least 1897. Since the 1990s, increasing numbers of Vancouver's South Asian residents have since relocated to other areas of Greater Vancouver and the Fraser Valley, particularly Surrey and Abbotsford. Nevertheless, many South Asians continue to live in Vancouver and choose not to move. Established in the 1960s, the Punjabi Market (Little India), located in South Vancouver, continues to act as a hub for the South Asian community across Greater Vancouver. The Sunset neighbourhood in southeast Vancouver contains the highest concentration of ethnic South Asians in the city, forming the largest ethnic group in the neighbourhood at 33.6%.There are also a group of other Indians from Fiji, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Trinidad that continue to reside in Vancouver.


=== Latin American ===
The Latin American community in East Vancouver is served by the Canadian Latin American Cultural Society on Commercial Drive.


== Key shopping areas ==


=== Kingsway ===

Kingsway was built on an ancient aboriginal footpath and is the historic connector between the early cities of New Westminster and Vancouver (Kingsway was originally named the ""Westminster Road"").
Today, it is one of the longer streets in the Greater Vancouver area (connecting Vancouver, Burnaby and New Westminster). Its length and varied services make it difficult to characterize; common businesses include diverse ethnic restaurants/cafés, specialty grocery stores, and many others.
Key shopping areas along Kingsway in East Vancouver include SoMa (South Main), Kesington-Cedar Cottage (From Fraser to Nanaimo streets) and Renfrew-Collingwood. There are many Vietnamese restaurants and shops along this corridor and it has aptly been named ""Little Saigon"" between Fraser and Nanaimo Street along Kingsway. The name ""Little Saigon"" was also up for debate.


=== Main Street ===
Main Street north of Keefer is effectively part of the Downtown Eastside and includes the former headquarters of the Vancouver City Police and the Vancouver Pre-Trial Centre.  Adjoining side-streets are largely small industry and warehouse, though verging quickly on Gastown  to the west and Japantown to the east.
Main Street between Keefer and Prior is part of Chinatown. This area has many Chinese businesses, particularly restaurants, small pottery and furniture stores, financial establishments, clothing stores and others. These businesses also extend to the east and the west of Main Street in this area. A popular Chinese New Year parade is held each year in this area.
Main Street is the core of the Mount Pleasant neighbourhood between East 2nd/Great Northern Way and East 16th avenues. This area is known for a younger, hip demographic. Common businesses include cafés, grocery stores, pubs, vintage clothing stores, independent media stores. There are fewer recent immigrants in this area and it is also much more influenced by people in their 20s and 30s.
Mid-Main (between East 17th and East 41st Avenues)
This area of Main Street is dominated by antique stores, restaurants, bars, cafés, clothing stores, bookstores, grocery stores, and independent video stores.
The South Asian District, or Punjabi Market is between E 45th to E 51st avenues.
South-East Marine Drive, between E 65th Avenue and SE Marine Drive and south to E Kent Avenue, has industrial and highway oriented retail.


=== Fraser Street ===
Fraser Street has two main shopping areas; a multi-ethnic (Chinese, Vietnamese, Filipino, Russian area) between East 24th and East 28th Avenues. A predominantly Indian district is present between East 43rd and East 50th Avenues; one of Vancouver's several ""Punjabi Markets"".  Street signs in the area of Main & 49th carry the city designation ""Little India"".


=== Commercial Drive ===

Commercial Drive (between Wall to E 17th Avenue) is one of the most vibrant areas of the Greater Vancouver region due to it strong multi-ethnic and activist identities. Culturally, this area is defined by the historic Italian and Portuguese communities, which developed a ""Little Italy"" here in the 1950s. Since that time, immigrants from Latin America, Asia, the Caribbean, Middle East and elsewhere mix with a strong aboriginal community to form a dynamic neighbourhood. Many residents from elsewhere in the city come to this area for shopping (e.g. Italian cheeses), restaurants, bars, cafés and the arts.The Commercial Drive area consistently ranks highly by city residents for many amenities, including ""best neighbourhood"", ""best local microbrewery"", ""best place to eat meat"", and ""best potential hipster hangout"".


=== Victoria Drive ===
Victoria Drive, between East 36th and East 43rd Avenues, is a vibrant Chinese community with many restaurants, grocery stores and other services.
Victoria Drive, between Hastings and 1st avenue is full of tight knit communities boasting community gardens, village corner stores and plant shops, 100-year-old heritage homes, and block parties all summer.  Most homes are beautifully painted and have been remodeled so they look exactly as they did 100 years ago.


=== Hastings Street ===
Hastings Street, which runs from downtown Vancouver in the west through Burnaby in the east, has many unique shopping areas.  Closer to downtown and Chinatown, a thriving street culture includes many low-income, drug addicted and homeless people, but also a close-knit community of social activists.  Local business includes pawn shops, cheap residency hotels, and a busy informal street market in illicit drugs.
Further east between Clark and Nanaimo, the street's commercial presence includes marine and transport services, as well as artist studios and the infamous ""chicken factories"" which sometimes permeate the area with their characteristic odour.  Between Nanaimo and Boundary Road is the Hastings Sunrise area, a busy commercial area of Asian and European shops and restaurants, as well as banks and other services.


== Housing, affordability and gentrification ==
In May 2007, the typical housing (""benchmark"") price of a single-detached house in East Vancouver was $627,758 (a 9% increase over the previous year and a 90% increase over the previous five years). Many home owners in East Vancouver rent out their basement suites to assist with mortgage payments.
Increased housing prices are causing changes in East Vancouver neighbourhoods, such as fewer new immigrants moving to the area and decreasing affordability for artists, seniors, young families and others.

However, increased housing prices have also caused significant positive changes in East Vancouver, such as greater retention of existing residents (partly due to a lack of affordability in some other areas), increased densification (increasing the number of affordable housing options (e.g. townhouses)), more residential investment, neighbourhood-led artistic projects, more community-pride events (e.g. neighbourhood clean-ups, block parties and community gardening), and greater tax base for new amenities(e.g. a new planned library and $2.7 million in street, lighting and sidewalk improvements at Kingsway and Knight Street).
Rising prices throughout the city have produced challenges for new social housing projects. This has caused conflict where East Vancouver residents feel that social housing projects are disproportionately located in their communities versus areas in Vancouver's West Side, some of which have no social housing at all (Dunbar, Kerrisdale and Shaughnessy)
Other general Vancouver housing concerns include increasing rental rates due to speculation associated with the Vancouver 2010 Olympics and recent provincial economic growth.
In January 2013, the leaseholders of the Waldorf Hotel, an East Vancouver institution, were told they must cease operations as of January 20, 2013, by order of the new owner and condo developer, Solterra Group of Companies. After public outcry to save the land, building and cultural institution, Mayor Gregor Robertson issued a public statement decrying the loss, which critics denounced as a sentimental bid for hipster votes.


== Amenities and celebrations ==
While the type of parks in East Vancouver is varied, one common element is the early morning t'ai chi practitioners. Other unique East Side park features include Trout Lake (the only lake in the city), the modern parkgrounds at Hastings Park, the large (38 ha.) and wild Everett Crowley Park, Kensington Park, where many wedding photographs are taken against the stunning backdrop of the city and North Shore Mountains, the bustling Refrew Community Park, the diverse Strathcona Park with its skatepark and climbing wall, and the multi-use Memorial Park, which is dedicated to soldiers who died in WW1 and today provides many spaces for sports teams and neighbours alike. Another park is the Falaise Park on the border of Burnaby and Vancouver.

== Politics ==
Politically, East Vancouver has often supported left-wing political candidates although demographic changes since the 1990s (e.g. significantly increasing family income levels) may be causing voting patterns to become more diverse. More specifically, the Northern portion of East Vancouver consistently votes for left-wing politicians by large margins, although the Southern areas tend to vote for centre to centre-right candidates.At the municipal level, East Vancouver is part of the ""at large"" political system and therefore is represented by all of Vancouver City Council. In the 2008 municipal election, the Vision Vancouver became the majority governing party at Vancouver's City Hall.
Provincially, East Vancouver includes the constituencies of Vancouver-Kensington, Vancouver-Kingsway, Vancouver-Hastings, Vancouver-Mount Pleasant and Vancouver-Fraserview. In the 2005 provincial election, all constituencies in East Vancouver were won by the British Columbia New Democratic Party except Vancouver-Fraserview, which is represented by the centre-right British Columbia Liberal Party.
Federally, East Vancouver includes the ridings of Vancouver East, Vancouver Kingsway
and Vancouver South. In the 2011 federal election, Vancouver East and Vancouver Kingsway were won by the federal New Democratic Party, while the Conservative Party of Canada won Vancouver South. This marked the first time since 1988 that the Tories managed to win a seat in Vancouver.
East Vancouver is home to both of Vancouver's left-wing bookstores. The People's Co-op Bookstore, founded in 1945 with a focus on communist and socialist literature, is Vancouver's oldest bookstore. Spartacus Books, founded in 1973 by an alliance of anarchists, Maoists, and social democrats, is entirely volunteer-run and hosts regular events. It is one of the oldest collectively-run bookstores in North America.

383,Park and Tilford Gardens,"The Park & Tilford Gardens is a 1.5-acre (6,100 m2) (originally  3-acre (12,000 m2)) botanic garden situated in the City of North Vancouver, British Columbia. The complex, established in 1969  as a community project of Canadian Park & Tilford Distilleries Ltd., consists of eight separate but interconnected areas. The original gardens were designed by Harry J. Webb of Justice & Webb Landscape Architects. 
The distillery closed in 1984, and the new owner rezoned the site for commercial use. Durante Kreuk Landscape Architects designed the entry gate and Waterfall Garden as part of the 1980s redevelopment of the Park & Tilford site after the Flower Garden was demolished.
The description below outlines the gardens as they existed in the 1970s:
""Each carries its own theme and is filled with flowers, fountains, waterfalls and aviaries. The Rose Garden, with a covered arbour and Florentine pergola, has more than 25 varieties of roses, ranging from delicate miniatures to showy floribunda. Nearby, the Herb Garden, the smallest area, contains plantings of medicinal and culinary herbs. A collection of tropical plants and flowers can be seen inside the Greenhouse, including a collection of bromeliads and succulents.
In warm weather a finch aviary among the blossoms complements the Flower Garden. The floral displays in 27 circular beds are changed frequently year-round. Nearby is a Bog Garden with day lilies, skunk cabbages, ornamental grasses and a six-foot leafed Gunnera plant.
Busts of famous botanists Douglas, Carl Linnaeus, and Menzies - are displayed in the Colonnade Garden, a cool area of vines arid vivid floral baskets. A larger aviary at the end of the colonnade is home for many colourful parrots, cockatoos, mynas and other tropical birds. Along the south bank is the Rhododendron Garden, sheltered by Douglas firs and dogwoods. A classic moon gate leads to the Oriental Garden, a tranquil setting reminiscent of Japan. The authentic Japanese tea house is a gift shop operated by the North Shore Association for the Physically Handicapped. The Native Wood Garden is devoted to trees and shrubs of British Columbia's coastal forests and interior semi-arid regions. A small Herb Garden is on display during summer months. There is a seed package, but not an exchange, program.    
Many rare forms of plant life are present in these gardens and they are being constantly added to. As a service to visitors and their friends, the Park and Tilford Gardens have made available a selection of seeds comprising the more outstanding plant forms featured. These selections will vary from year to year as outstanding new hybrids and strains are proven.
The Park & Tilford Gardens' Review is published periodically to keep patrons up to date on events and informed with garden checklists, green thumb tips and more.""

384,Empire Field,"Empire Field was a temporary Canadian football and soccer stadium built at Hastings Park in the Canadian city of Vancouver, British Columbia. Located on the site of the former Empire Stadium, the 27,528 spectator venue was constructed to allow a new retractable roof to be installed at BC Place in 2010 and 2011. Empire Field was home to the Canadian Football League's (CFL) BC Lions for the 2010 and part of the 2011 seasons, and for Major League Soccer's (MLS) Vancouver Whitecaps FC for part of their debut 2011 season.
The venue was constructed by Nussli Group in three months, cost $14.4 million and opened on June 15, 2010. The venue featured 20,500 roofed bucket seats—with the remaining 7,000 being benches—12 luxury suites, a press room, flood lighting and a FieldTurf artificial turf. The venue's record attendance are two sell-out matches: for the Lions it occurred in inaugural 2010 regular-season match against the Saskatchewan Roughriders; for the Whitecaps, it was a regular-season match against the Los Angeles Galaxy. Dismantling took place in November and December 2011 and the site is now used as a community playing field.


== History ==
Empire Field was built on the same lot as Empire Stadium, which was originally built for the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. The 32,375-spectator stadium was used by the Lions from 1954 until 1982. For soccer, the venue was used by North American Soccer League's Vancouver Royals from 1967 to 1968 and subsequently by the Vancouver Whitecaps from 1974 to 1982. Both the Lions and Whitecaps moved to the newly constructed, then 60,000 seat BC Place for the 1983 season. Empire Stadium was demolished in 1993, and the location converted to a community sports park. The Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation opened Empire Bowl on the site on 2003, which consisted of a 5.5 hectares (14 acres) lot, costing $2.9 million. It had irrigated grass soccer fields, two baseball diamonds and a gravel running track.

Following a 2007 roof deflation at BC Place, Premier Gordon Campbell announced on the plans to build a retractable roof on the stadium. Stadium owner and operator BC Pavilion Corporation (PavCo) announced on October 23, 2009 that they had signed a fix-cost agreement with PCL Constructors Canada to build a new roof, including the cost of a temporary stadium. The construction was financed through a loan from the provincial government to PavCo. The decision to build the roof was, according to Whitecaps president Bob Lenarduzzi, ""key"" to bringing a MLS franchise to Vancouver. In 2009, the Whitecaps signed a five-year agreement to play their home matches at BC Place, starting in 2011.To allow the Lions to continue playing as normal and support the new Whitecaps franchise, PavCo decided to build the temporary venue at the Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) in Hastings Park in eastern Vancouver. Because BC Place was to be used as the Olympic Stadium during the 2010 Winter Olympics, refurbishment could not start until after February 2010. The details for the stadium were released by PNE and PavCo on December 22, 2009. The venue cost $14.4 million in a fixed-price contract, and was included in the $458 million set aside to renovate BC Place. Representatives from both teams stated that they hoped to play on the nostalgia factor for the affected seasons. The Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation stated immediately after the press release that they had not been consulted or informed about the decision to build a professional sports venue on their grounds. Although the board was responsible for operating the facilities, the land was owned by PNE, which is again owned by the city. There were no public hearings or a city council vote to decide on the issue.

The contract to build the stadium was issued the Nussli Group of Switzerland, which specializes in the construction of temporary stadiums. They used their NT grandstand system, which allowed for modular construction of stands. Construction implemented 2,500 tonnes of material. Nussli's senior project manager, Florian Weber, stated that the most difficult part of the construction was the occupancy permit, caused by the short construction schedule. Construction took 111 days, and was completed in late June 2010. Several commentators stated that use of temporary stadiums on a permanent basis could be used for other MLS and CFL stadia. For instance, the price of building an 18,500 seat permanent soccer-specific stadium was averaging $200 million.After the reopening of BC Place, the stands at Empire Field were disassembled in November and December 2011, with the turf, locker rooms and lighting masts being left behind. Equipment and components leased from Nussli were returned. Public consultations regarding use of the lot were conducted until June 2012, after which it was decided to create a community sports park. It features a mountain bike park to the north, a 3.9-meter (13 ft) wide running track around the field and a skateboarding and graffiti tunnel. The area around the turf was expanded, allowing for two east–west fields, rather than one north–south. The legacy items were valued at $2.8 million in 2010.


== Specifications ==
Empire Field was located in Hastings Park, in the Vancouver neighborhood of Hastings-Sunrise, next to Playland, an amusement park. Other sports facilities at Hastings Park include Pacific Coliseum and Agrodome. The venue was owned by the BC Pavilion Corporation, which in turn is owned by the provincial Government of British Columbia. It lies on the grounds of and will be operated by the Pacific National Exhibition, which is owned by the Vancouver City Council.

The stadium featured a seating capacity of 27,528, of which ca. 20,500 were bucket seats and ca. 7,000 were benches. The bucket seats were located under a roof, while there was no roof on the bench ends. In addition there are twelve executive boxes, a VIP zone, flood lighting and media facilities. Empire Field uses the FieldTurf artificial turf which was used at BC Place prior to the renovations. The venue was built so that it would not receive additional seating during playoffs. Lockers were located in construction trailers, with players having to pass through pedestrian traffic in the concourse to reach the lockers.Compared to BC Place, Empire Field's seats were located closer to the field, giving a more intimate fan experience. The use of Empire Field deteriorated the Lions' strong home advantage. As BC Place was the only domed stadium in the CFL, its pressurized air made breathing more difficult, it had high summer night temperatures and a slight air flow which put off opposing kickers. The dome amplified the crowd, making team communication difficult. John Knox, president of the Vancouver Southsiders, described Empire as their ancestral home and that ""it gave us a taste of the experience our parents and their parents had when going to matches in Vancouver.""TransLink served the stadium with the 135 Express and Line 28. On game days, the transit operator set up special buses which connected with the SkyTrain at Renfrew Station and 29th Avenue Station. Hastings Park is located on the Trans-Canada Highway. There are 1,300 parking spaces within a ten-minute walk from the stadium site. Several of these lots are offered with season parking tickets, which for 2010 cost $300. The stadium provided a free bicycle valet service. Compared to BC Place, which is located Downtown, Empire Field offered poor public transport service.


== Events ==

The Lions opened the venue on June 20, 2010, with a pre-season 36–32 loss against the Edmonton Eskimos, in front of a crowd of 24,763. In 2010, the team played one pre-season and nine regular-season games at the field. The team's highest attendance was the 29,517 spectators who watched the Saskatchewan Roughriders win 37–18 on July 10, in the first regular-season game to be played at Empire Field. The team drew an average attendance of 24,327 during the regular season, down 2,805 from 2009. During the 2011 season, the Lions played one pre-season and five regular-season games at Empire Field. For the regular season, the Lions drew an average 24,297 spectators, with a high of 25,263 seeing the Toronto Argonauts game on September 10, the last game played at Empire Field. This compared to an average attendance of 36,509 for the regular-season games at BC Place. The Lions' overall record at Empire Field was 5–10.The Whitecaps, who would play their 2010 season in the USSF Division 2 Professional League, remained at Swangard Stadium for that season. The 2011 season was the franchise's debut in the MLS. The Caps' first game was a 4–2 victory over Toronto FC on March 19, in front of 22,592 spectators. The team played 13 of 17 MLS home games at Empire Field, in addition to both home games in the 2011 Canadian Championship and a friendly against Manchester City as part of the 2011 World Football Challenge. The Whitecaps' last game at Empire Field, a 3–1 loss to Seattle Sounders FC, took place on September 24. The first match at BC Place was played on October 2. The Caps had an average attendance of 20,577 for their 13 MLS games, with the Los Angeles Galaxy drawing a record high crowd of 27,500 and the San Jose Earthquakes drawing a record low crowd of 15,608. In comparison, the team's four games at BC Place drew an average 19,850 spectators. The Whitecaps' overall record for all games at Empire Field was 4–5–7 Braley stated that the temporary stadium cost the Whitecaps an estimated 1,600 season ticket sales and three major sponsors.The stadium hosted a concert with Bryan Adams and The Beach Boys on August 21, 2010, to celebrate the centennial anniversary of PNE.

385,Callister Park,"Con Jones Park was a sports facility located in East Vancouver that was mainly used for soccer. It opened in 1921, and was renamed Callister Park in 1942. After the demolition of the stadium in 1971, the area was redeveloped into a green space and retained the name Callister Park.


== Background ==

In April 1885 builder and contractor John Callister arrived in Vancouver from the Isle of Man. Callister was a pioneer who built his home in a forested area covering about three blocks in 1904. Upon his death Callister, a bachelor, left his property to two nieces. One of the sisters died, and Mrs. Ada M. Stevenson inherited all of the property.
On September 18, 1920, sports promoter Con Jones entered into an agreement to purchase ""lot 5, Town of Hastings, Suburban Lands"" for $10,000 from Stevenson. According to the Vancouver city archives only three payments of $1,000 were made. In the space of a year, Jones supervised the building of a grandstand and field and Con Jones Park opened in 1921.
The park was destroyed by fire in June, 1934. Jones' sons rebuilt the stadium within weeks.
Media reports stated that due to Jones' default on payment, Stevenson seized the property and offered to present the land to the city. While many focus on the lack of mortgage payments, it appears to be several years of unpaid city taxes that forced the issue. Both of Jones' sons had died, which brought this to light. The land reverted to the Callister estate, and Stevenson donated it to the city in lieu of paying the taxes on it.
On March 20, 1942, Mrs. Stevenson entered into an agreement with the city to present the area for ""municipal purposes"". The bequest further stated that this expression...""be deemed to include exhibition, recreation or park purposes and the carrying on of public sports.""
With the opening of Empire Stadium in 1954, many of the touring soccer teams from the United Kingdom shifted their friendlies to the much larger and more modern facility which was only a five minute walk away on the opposite side of the PNE grounds.


== Soccer at Callister Park ==
From 1939 to 1970, the Pacific Coast League was one of the primary attractions at Callister Park. League matches were played at the stadium until January 1942, then again for every Pacific Coast League season from 1945-46 to 1969-70.


== British touring soccer ==
From the time the PNE took possession of Callister Park - until the opening of Empire Stadium in 1954 - with soccer as its principal tenant Callister Park made money. The annual friendlies featuring touring British soccer teams playing against local all-star squads were the most profitable.In 1921 Third Lanark played two games in Vancouver; one at Con Jones Park and the other at Brockton Oval at Stanley Park.
Newcastle United visited on June 4, 1949 and played the BC All-Stars in front of an overflow crowd of 9,800. The game was played a week after a rodeo was staged on the grounds, prompting Newcastle manager George Martin to describe Callister as, ""...a disgrace to football"". Rangers were the final big name team to play at Callister in 1954.


== Baseball ==
The Vancouver Maple Leafs brought professional baseball back to the city for the first time in 15 years in a 5-4 loss to the Tacoma Tigers before 1,500 fans in April 1937. The Western International League would leave Con Jones Park at the end of the 1938 season as Jones sold the team to Seattle beer baron Emil Sick. Sick renamed the team the Vancouver Capilanos (after his brewery) and moved the team crosstown to Athletic Park for the 1939 season.


== Other Sports ==
There were sports other than soccer played at the facility. Field Lacrosse was popular in the Intercity Lacrosse League during the 1920s and 1930s. Rodeos, demolition derby and rugby union were also staged there from time-to-time, although in the case of rugby, Brockton Oval, Vancouver's Athletic Park and UBC's Varsity Stadium (Vancouver) were the standard facilities for the game.

386,Empire Stadium (Vancouver),"For the later temporary home of Vancouver Whitecaps FC and the British Columbia Lions, see Empire Field.Empire Stadium was a multi-purpose stadium that stood at the Pacific National Exhibition site at Hastings Park in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Track and field and Canadian football, as well as soccer and musical events, were held at the stadium. The stadium was originally constructed for the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. The stadium (which sat 32,375 upon opening, but 30,229 after 1974) hosted both Elvis Presley and The Beatles. It saw most of its use as the home of the BC Lions of the CFL from 1954 to 1982, in which the venue also played host to the first Grey Cup game held west of Ontario in 1955. Empire Stadium also hosted the Grey Cup game in 1958, 1960, 1963, 1966, 1971, and 1974; seven times in total.
Empire Stadium was often home to the Shrine Bowl Provincial Championship for provincial senior high school.The stadium was also home to the Vancouver Whitecaps of the North American Soccer League during the 1970s and early 1980s, as well as the Vancouver Royals of the same league for their only year of play in 1968.
Just before the 1966 Grey Cup game, the stadium had the new ""gooseneck"" or ""slingshot"" goal posts erected invented by Jim Trimble and Joel Rottman, marking the first time these goalposts were used at any level of football in a championship game. They were first used a week earlier at Montreal's Autostade for the 1966 Eastern Conference final; this model goalpost would soon become the standard design in the NFL and CFL. In 1970, it became the first facility in Canada to have artificial playing surface installed made by 3M, under the brand name ""Tartan Turf"".
Both the Lions and Whitecaps moved to BC Place Stadium for the 1983 season. The stadium was demolished in the early 1990s. The site served as a parking lot for the neighbouring Pacific National Exhibition as well as Playland for many years before being converted to a soccer field and track on the site of the old field.
With BC Place Stadium undergoing renovations in 2010 and 2011, the BC Lions and Vancouver Whitecaps played their home games at Empire Field, a temporary field constructed on the former grounds of Empire Stadium.  After the renovations to BC Place were complete, the temporary stadium was removed.  The park and sports fields were restored for community use.


== The Miracle Mile ==
Vancouver hosted the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in 1954 at Empire Stadium. The most famous event of the games was the One Mile Race in which both John Landy and Roger Bannister ran the distance in under four minutes. The race's end is memorialized in a statue of the two (with Landy glancing over his shoulder, thus losing the race), that stood outside the stadium until its demolition. The statue formerly stood near the south end of Hastings St., but has since been moved to the Pacific National Exhibition north entrance just metres from where the feat took place at the new Empire Fields.

390,Langara College,"Langara College (snəw̓eyəɬ leləm̓ in Halkomelem) is a public degree-granting college in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which serves approximately 22,000 students annually through its university, career, and continuing studies programs. The college takes its name from the neighbourhood in which it is situated, which was named after Spanish Admiral Juan de Lángara.


== History ==
Langara College courses and programs were first offered in 1965 at King Edward Centre as part of Vancouver City College. Since 1970, the current campus on West 49th Avenue has housed Langara's programs for almost 50 years. On April 1, 1994, Langara College was established as an independent public college under the Provincial College and Institute Act. Langara College Continuing Studies was established in 1997. To provide more space, a new classroom and office building was opened in January 1997. The new library/classroom building was opened in September 2007. Langara College began the construction of the Science and Technology Building in 2013 as part of Phase II (of IV) of the Master Plan to upgrade and expand the campus. Construction was officially completed in September 2016.


== Name ==
Musqueam, whose unceded territory Langara currently occupies, gave the traditional name snəw̓eyəɬ leləm̓ meaning 'house of teachings' to the college in January 2016. snəw̓eyəɬ references advice given to children to guide them into adulthood and build their character.

391,Studio 58,"Studio 58 is a professional theatre training school in Vancouver, British Columbia. A part of Langara College's Theatre Arts Program, the school offers a three-year program for acting students and a two-year program for production students. A Bachelor of Fine Arts is offered with an additional year of study through a partnership with Capilano University. It is distinguished as one of the top theatre schools in Canada and the only conservatory-style theatre training program in Western Canada.The school auditions hundreds of people across Canada but only sixteen students are accepted per semester. The school has around 72 students for both its three-year acting program and two-year production program.

Professional directors and designers are hired to work on each production, and occasionally guest performing artists. Studio 58 productions are open to the public and reviewed by the Vancouver media.


== History ==
The school was founded in 1965 as a small theatre arts course first held on the King Edward Campus of Vancouver City College, now Vancouver Community College. Led under the direction of Antony Holland the course grew into a full program. In 1970, the program moved to new facilities on the Langara Campus and became known as Studio 58, named after the room number of the original theatre space. The theatre program has subsequently moved into new buildings but the name remains to this day.
In 1985, Holland stepped down as the Artistic Director and Kathryn Shaw stepped into the role. The same year, Jane Heyman moved into the newly formed position as Associated Director until 2005. She was replaced by David Hudgins, a graduate of the program.
Development in 2012 led to a partnership of theatre programs in Vancouver where a Bachelor of Fine Arts is offered graduates through an additional year of study at Capilano University.

392,Cassiar Tunnel,"The Cassiar Connector is a highway traffic tunnel on the Trans-Canada Highway. It is located in the north-east corner of Vancouver, British Columbia, near the Vancouver-Burnaby border.
Travelling northward, the tunnel begins underneath Adanac Street, passing under the interchange between East Hastings Street and the Highway 1 offramps. It ends underneath Triumph Street, with the highway continuing north to the McGill Street interchange (to the Port of Vancouver) and the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing towards the District of North Vancouver.  The tunnel is 730 metres (2,400 ft) long. Dangerous goods are not permitted to be transported through it.


== History ==
In August 1960 the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing (known at the time as the Second Narrows Bridge) was opened to traffic. This was followed in 1964 by the completion of the Trans Canada Highway. However, the portion of the highway passing through Vancouver was not built to highway standards. Instead, it used an existing portion of Cassiar Street, including the intersection of Cassiar and Hastings Street. This meant that traffic on the highway was controlled by traffic lights at Hastings and Cassiar also at Adanac Street and again at William Street for traffic control from the Rupert Park Diversion, all contributing to congestion especially during peak periods.
The Cassiar Connector was completed in January 1992; at the time it was described as removing one of the last remaining traffic lights on the Trans Canada Highway and also as the BC Ministry of Transportation's largest project to date. The project upgraded 2.3 km of highway south of the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge, and involved the construction of seven new overpasses, 20 retaining walls, a pedestrian bridge, two new interchanges and the Cassiar Tunnel itself which is 730m long.  The total cost of construction was estimated to be C$115 million. On January 12, 1992, a Sunday, pedestrians were allowed to roam through the dual tunnels. The next day, it was opened to vehicle traffic, and the Trans Canada highway was diverted to the new route.


== Highway expansion ==
In 2005, the British Columbia provincial government introduced an infrastructure plan known as the ""Gateway Program"". As part of that program, the Trans Canada highway through the Cassiar Connector was increased to three lanes in each direction. These lanes were intended to be used primarily for dedicated entry and exit lanes. Because the tunnel was originally designed to have three lanes in each direction, expansion was not necessary.

393,Delbrook Senior Secondary School,"Delbrook Senior Secondary was a public high school from 1957 to 1977 in the District of North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, part of School District 44 North Vancouver.


== History ==
Delbrook opened in 1957 as only the second secondary school in North Vancouver (District or City), joining North Vancouver High School which itself opened in 1910.  Delbrook was named for the area and avenue north of Westview in the city and district, east of Mosquito Creek and west of Lonsdale.  Approximately 100 students from the graduating class of 1958 were moved from North Vancouver Secondary to form the first graduating class.


=== Catchment area ===
Its catchment area was bounded in this manner: from the North Shore mountains directly south along Lonsdale Avenue to 29th Street, then east to St. George's Road.  Then south to Highway #1, then west to Mosquito Creek, again south to the top of the hill on Edgemont Blvd. north of 21st Street where it ran west again above 21st Street, to turn north again back to Highway #1 to include all houses on the west and east sides of Edgemont south of the highway.  The area was then bounded by a line going west along Highway #1 to MacKay Creek, where it turned north along the creek to a western-line north of all property along Woods Drive to the Capilano River.  Then north along the river, turned east north of Capilano Crescent and again along the middle of Ridgewood Drive to MacKay Creek, where it turned north along the creek to Emsley Creek, where it connected with the corner of Sunnycrest Drive and Highlands Blvd.  It continued east between Wentworth Avenue on the south and Sunnycrest on the north to Mosquito Creek, where it finally followed the creek north back into the North Shore mountains.The catchment area boundaries in the north Lonsdale area changed with time. According to Rosemary Redfield (née Gagne) during the 1964-65 school year the catchment area extended at least as far east as St. Mary's Street.


=== Fire and closure ===
Citing district-wide declining enrolment throughout the 1970s, the North Vancouver School Board planned to phase out Delbrook by June 1979.  However, on January 28, 1977, a fire started in the lower section of the school doing $2M damage.  Students completed the 1977 year at nearby Balmoral Junior Secondary, but retained their separate school identity and classes by going in shifts. In June Delbrook as an institution was formally closed two years earlier than proposed.A University of British Columbia master's thesis studied Delbrook's sudden closing on the effects it had on grade 11 and 12 students being forced to transfer late in their high school careers.  It found minimal impact on those transferring, except for some difficulty integrating into the established student body.
The remaining buildings, including the gymnasium and cafeteria (which both survived the fire) now operates under North Vancouver Parks and Recreation as the Delbrook Community Recreation Centre.
(In 2009 Balmoral Junior Secondary became part of the Carson Graham Secondary School as its Balmoral campus.  Balmoral is slated to permanently close in 2012.)


== Academics and grade levels ==
Delbrook offered courses in a variety of subjects, including the humanities, sciences, language arts, linguistics, the arts, and early computer technology.
With the opening of Balmoral Junior Secondary in 1959, Delbrook focussed on grades 10, 11 and 12.  In 1969, the grade 10 class was split between the two schools.  Beginning 1971, Delbrook offered grades 8 to 12.


== Musical theatre ==

Delbrook was known for large production musicals. Mr. Norm Ashcroft, Vice-Principal (1969-1975), was instrumental in reviving musicals at Delbrook.  The following is a list of musicals put on at Delbrook:

A Christmas Carol in 1961
Oklahoma! in 1965
Oliver! in 1971
The Wizard of Oz in 1972
South Pacific in 1973.
Annie Get Your Gun! in 1974The Wizard of Oz was taken from a 1945 stage play using songs from the 1939 film; adapted by Frank Gabrielson for the St. Louis Municipal Opera.


== Hey Nostradamus! ==
Douglas Coupland's 2003 novel Hey Nostradamus! begins at a fictional Delbrook Senior Secondary in 1988 with a Columbine-like massacre at the school, the original having taken place in April 1999 in Jefferson County, Colorado.

395,Capilano Suspension Bridge,"The Capilano Suspension Bridge is a simple suspension bridge crossing the Capilano River in the District of North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The current bridge is 140 metres (460 ft) long and 70 metres (230 ft) above the river. It is part of a private facility with an admission fee, and draws over 1.2 million visitors per year.


== History ==
The bridge was originally built in 1889 by George Grant Mackay, a Scottish civil engineer and park commissioner for Vancouver. It was originally made of hemp ropes with a deck of cedar planks, and was replaced with a wire cable bridge in 1903. In 1910 Edward Mahon purchased the Capilano Suspension Bridge. ""Mac"" MacEachran purchased the Bridge from Mahon in 1935 and invited local natives to place their totem poles in the park, adding a native theme. In 1945, he sold the bridge to Henri Aubeneau.
The bridge was completely rebuilt in 1956.The park was sold to Nancy Stibbard, the current owner, in 1983. Annual attendance increased, and in May 2004, Treetops Adventures was opened, consisting of seven footbridges suspended between old-growth Douglas Fir trees on the west side of the canyon, forming a walkway up to 30 metres (98 ft) above the forest floor.

In June 2011, a new attraction called Cliffwalk was added to the park.


== Incidents ==
In September 1999, a woman dropped her 18-month-old child with Down syndrome off the bridge. She claimed she stumbled accidentally and the child slipped from her grasp. The child was not seriously injured. The woman lost legal custody of her child to the child's father as a result of the incident. The woman took legal action against the owner of the bridge, her ex-husband and the Federal Department of Justice. The case against the owner of the bridge was settled in 2004.In 2006, a 300-year-old, 46-tonne Douglas fir tree toppled during a heavy snowstorm. The tree fell across the western end of the bridge. Park officials closed the bridge temporarily while repairs were performed.
On June 6, 2010, a teenage tourist on a class trip from California climbed over a railing and fell more than 30 metres (98 ft) from a fenced off viewing platform near the bridge. By the time rescue workers came to his aid, the victim was dead. The official RCMP finding was that the teen was under the influence of LSD at the time of the incident.On June 2, 2012, a 30-year-old tourist from Ontario died after falling near the bridge. Police say the victim was hiking through trails near the popular attraction when he climbed over a railing and fell to the riverbed below.


== Popular culture ==
The bridge has been featured as a setting in episodes of several television series, including MacGyver, Sliders, The Crow: Stairway to Heaven, and Psych.
In 1974, social psychologists Donald Dutton and Arthur Aron conducted a well-known experiment on the bridge.  Men approached by a female researcher on the bridge were more likely to call her later than men approached on a more solid bridge across the river.  Dutton and Aron argued that this supported the theory that the men were mis-attributing the arousal caused by fear to sexual attraction toward the woman. This research supported Stanley Schachter's two-factor theory of emotion.
In June 2019, Korean Pop group NCT 127 created a video of their visit to the Capilano Suspension Bridge as part of the social media documenting their world tour NCT 127: The Origin.

396,Vancouver Quadra,"Vancouver Quadra is a federal electoral district in the Metro Vancouver region of British Columbia, Canada. It has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1949. The constituency name refers to Quadra Island in the Georgia Strait. Since 2007, the riding has been represented by Liberal MP Joyce Murray, who has served in the 29th ministry under Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau.
Within the boundaries of this riding are the University of British Columbia and the western portions of the affluent West Side of Vancouver. Voters within Vancouver Quadra have tended to elect centrist candidates, which is an exception to the province as a whole where politics has tended to be more polarized. Though the Liberals have held the seat since 1984, MPs tend to be on the right wing of the party. For example, the current MP, Joyce Murray, was previously a cabinet minister in the centre-right British Columbia Liberal Party, which is unaffiliated with the federal Liberal party and attracts the vast majority of voters who vote for the Conservative Party of Canada in federal elections.


== Demographics ==
This is the sixth wealthiest riding in Canada, with an average family income of over $145,000. As of 2006, this riding had 37% immigrants, most of whom are Chinese-Canadians. The province's largest university, the University of British Columbia, is situated in this riding. The major employer is the professional, scientific and technical service sector. The unemployment rate is 5.2%. Nearly every single-family house in this riding is worth over a million dollars.The Vancouver Quadra riding has a very high level of educational attainment; it has the highest percentage of people with a university certificate or degree in all of Canada (55.7%) and also tops the following educational attainment sub-categories:

== Geography ==
The district includes the parts of the West Side of Vancouver and the University of British Columbia Endowment Lands.


== History ==
The electoral district was created in 1947 from Vancouver East and Vancouver South ridings.  It was a swing riding for most of its first four decades.  However, in 1984, John Turner, then Prime Minister, unseated Progressive Conservative incumbent Bill Clarke even as Turner's Liberals suffered what was then the biggest seat loss in Canadian history.  It was one of only two Liberal-held seats west of Ontario.  The seat has stayed in Liberal hands ever since.
The 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution concluded that the electoral boundaries of Vancouver Quadra should be adjusted, and a modified electoral district of the same name will be contested in future elections. The redefined Vancouver Quadra loses a portion of its current territory east of the Arbutus Corridor to the new district of Vancouver Granville. These new boundaries were legally defined in the 2013 representation order, which came into effect upon the call of the 42nd Canadian federal election, scheduled for October 2015.

This riding has elected the following Members of Parliament:


=== Current Member of Parliament ===

402,"Sunset, Vancouver","Sunset is the most ethnically diverse neighbourhood in Vancouver, British Columbia. It is located in the south-east quadrant of the city. Surrounding the multicultural Fraser Street district, Sunset is bordered by both the Marpole and Oakridge neighbourhoods to the west, and the Victoria-Fraserview neighbourhood to the east.


== History ==
Development of the Sunset neighbourhood first took place in the 1860s. At the time, the area was part of the District of South Vancouver and consisted mostly of farmland alongside a cluster of homes. Extensive logging took place along the south slope of Vancouver during the late 19th into early 20th century, prompting communities such as Sunset to rapidly industrialize.In 1929, the District of South Vancouver amalgamated with the City of Vancouver, thus incorporating Sunset as a part of the city. The neighbourhood remained quite rural until the 1940s, when a large wave immigrants from central and eastern Europe moved into the area. Many new German immigrants established churches, most of which remain to this day.In the 1960s, another large wave of immigrants moved into Sunset. Primarily Sikhs from the Punjab region of South Asia, the new immigrants founded the Punjabi Market (Little India) on Main Street and presided over the last final large scale development in the neighbourhood with the construction hundreds of Vancouver Specials. As most development in the area ceased in the 1980s, these homes continue to be a mainstay across southeast Vancouver.
Today, the neighbourhood is among the most ethnically diverse across Metro Vancouver and continues the serve as the centre of the South Asian community in Vancouver.


== Geography ==
Sunset lies between E 41st Avenue, Ontario St,  Knight St and the Fraser River.
Commercial districts in Sunset are situated on Fraser Street between 41st and 51st avenues; named as Vancouver's most multicultural neighbourhood, the Fraser district features many South Asian, Chinese, Filipino and European businesses.Another commercial district in Sunset is the Punjabi Market (also known as Little India) which is situated on Main Street and 49th Avenue.
Like most of south-east Vancouver, the area used to be predominantly working class but rising house prices elsewhere have made the area increasingly popular with young professionals and families who can no longer afford houses in areas such as the west side.

403,Spanish Banks,"Spanish Banks are a series of beaches in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, located along the shores of English Bay in the West Point Grey neighbourhood. Spanish Banks is located between Locarno Beach to the east and the grounds of the University of British Columbia to the west. 


== History ==
Although the first European explorers in the Strait of Georgia were the Spaniards Juan Carrasco and José María Narváez, who sighted Point Grey in 1791, the Spanish Banks were named in commemoration of the meeting of the English under George Vancouver and the Spanish under Galiano and Valdés in June 1792. While Vancouver's maps do not show the bank, Galiano's charts of 1792 and 1795 do. The Hudson's Bay Company came to call the area Spanish Banks for these reasons. The name was bestowed upon them by Captain Richards of HMS Plumper during his survey of Burrard Inlet in 1859.


== About Spanish Banks Beaches ==

Although technically just one bank, the Spanish Banks beaches are divided into three sections: Spanish Bank East, Spanish Bank Extension, and Spanish Bank West. These beaches are backed by grassy fields, which make them popular for walks, family gatherings, picnics, soccer and volleyball games. There is a separated bike path next to a walking path that runs parallel to the water. Metered parking was considered as other nearby beaches in Vancouver, such as Kitsilano Beach, are metered, but the decisions was postponed by the Vancouver Park Board in March 2018. Spanish Banks is best known for its low tide flats, which are most prominent at Spanish Bank West. While swimming is possible at Spanish Bank East, skimboarding and kitesurfing are more popular activities at Spanish Bank West.


== The beaches ==


=== Spanish Bank East ===
Spanish Bank East is situated west of Tolmie Street on Northwest Marine Drive. The beach is equipped with thirty sand volleyball courts that operate on a first-come, first-served basis. There are lifeguards on site (from Victoria Day to Labour Day), and a concession stand.  A popular activity on Spanish Banks East is skimboarding in the many shallow pools and waves.


=== Spanish Bank West ===
Spanish Bank West is located west of Spanish Bank East on Northwest Marine Drive. Like Spanish Bank East, this beach has eight volleyball courts, life guards on site in summer and a concession stand. However, this beach is designated as a quiet beach so no amplified music is permitted.


=== Spanish Bank Extension ===
Spanish Bank Extension is to the west of Spanish Bank West and is the westernmost part of Spanish Banks before the shoreline becomes much narrower and rocky as it heads towards Acadia Beach. There are lifeguards on site in summer, but there are no concession stands or volleyball courts as there is little sand. Most of Spanish Banks Extension is a designated dogs off-leash area.

404,St. George's School (Vancouver),"St. George's School (informally: Saints) is an independent boarding and day university-preparatory school for boys, founded in 1930 in Vancouver, British Columbia.


== History ==

St. George's was founded in 1930 by a group of Englishmen recently arrived in British Columbia. Captain John Harker, serving from 1943 to 1962, was its second and one of the most influential headmasters of St. George's School.The original school operated out of a large country manor house. It has since expanded dramatically, and the school now maintains two campuses; the Senior School, on land leased from UBC in 1925, and the Junior School, converted from the former Convent of the Sacred Heart, a historic property purchased in 1979, which had formerly served as a Catholic all-girls school. The school continues to expand to this day, the most recent updates being the renovation of the Junior School Campus. Currently, there is a campus ""masterplan"" set which includes the demolition of the current Senior School Building and creating a completely redesigned Senior campus.


== Students ==
The student body at St. George's comprises 1,151 boys from 22 countries, with approximately 750 boys in the Senior School and the remainder in the Junior School. As of June 2016, 109 students were boarding students. Like other independent schools, it maintains a system of prefects and mandates the wearing of uniforms. School Captain and other prefects are elected by the faculty and their fellow students to provide student leaders with the School. Past School Captains and other prefects have included Rhodes Scholars, diplomats, prominent lawyers and businessmen, and professional athletes. The uniform, as is frequently the case in similar Canadian schools, includes an emblazoned blazer, grey flannels, and the wearing of the appropriate school tie. The school ties vary depending on extracurricular achievement and on grade. Students in grades 1–6 wear a striped red, white, and black tie, students in grade 7 wear a blue one, those in grades 8–11 wear a darker blue one with the school's crest on it, and those in grade 12 wear a red tie. Those who have attended since Grade 1 are called ""Lifers"".


== Academics ==
St. George's School emphasizes academic performance as well as the building of moral character, and the formation of strong, upstanding traits. The school offers a variety of academic options that include enriched and advanced-placement classes. Advanced Placement courses from the College Board are generally offered starting in 11th Grade. In the 2016-2017 school year, senior school students wrote 357 AP Exams, and 159 students wrote at least one exam. Its boys participate in many regional, national, and international academic contests, in mathematics, the sciences, and in the humanities and social sciences. Here is a list of Advanced Placement courses offered at St. George's School:


== University placement ==
St. George's School frequently places its graduates in universities in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom. Of its 155 students in the 2017 graduating class, virtually all of its students enter post-secondary education. In 2016, St. George's School students received $1.5 million in merit-based scholarships, received 720 offers from 140 universities, including 10 offers from US Ivy League universities. About 100 of students chose a university in Canada, around 40 attend American universities, and 5 students attended university overseas. The most popular universities for students were the University of British Columbia, Queen's University, and the University of Toronto.


== Athletics ==

Sports is a major part of the student experience at St. George's School. Approximately 80% of students play in a competitive team. To encourage students to live a healthy life and build character, the school mandates that its boys select a recreational or competitive sport starting from Grade 8. Boys in Grades 11-12 may opt out for one term based on past games attendance. St George's sports teams have done extremely well in the last decades, especially with the high quantity and often quality of athleticism and high level of competency in the coaching staff. St. George's has a wide variety of sports teams, including:


== Outdoor education ==
There is also a mandatory outdoor education program implemented for students from grades 1-10. Students are required to participate in outdoor educational programs both in the junior school and the senior school. These activities range from half day trips (grade 1) to full, week-long excursions (grade 10). The junior experiences focus on an education aspect: students learn about First Nations peoples and about the environment. The senior trips involve more personal-based learning; activities in the wilderness such as hiking, kayaking and canoeing focus on leadership and interpersonal skills. There is also a focus on environmental care and education. In grade 10, students have the option of applying for the 'Discovery 10' cohort program. This program is limited to 20 students who participate in a modified Social Studies and PE program, focusing on First Nations history, environmental studies, and outdoor leadership. The students spend approximately 55 days of each school year out of class on outdoor-education trips (hiking, canoeing, kayaking, rock-climbing).


== Clubs and activities ==

The school offers a variety of extra-curricular clubs:

Students publish a school yearbook—the Georgian, a magazine—the Saint, as well as a literary and artistic journal—the Opus. There are also various student-organized events such as music nights, socials, and mixers with sister schools Crofton House and York House.


== Notable alumni ==

== Notes ==
The junior school campus (Convent of the Sacred Heart) is a heritage site.
St. George's ""sister"" schools are York House School in Vancouver BC, St. Margaret's School in Victoria BC and Crofton House School, also in Vancouver.
The school has a rivalry with Vancouver College; for example, the Saints' and VC rowing crews compete annually in a regatta in April, the ""Saints College Boat Race"".

405,Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing,"The Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing, also called the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge and Second Narrows Bridge, is the second bridge constructed at the Second (east) Narrows of Burrard Inlet in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Originally named the Second Narrows Bridge, it connects Vancouver to the North Shore of Burrard Inlet, which includes the District of North Vancouver, the City of North Vancouver, and West Vancouver. It was constructed adjacent to the older Second Narrows Bridge, which is now exclusively a rail bridge. Its construction, from 1956 to 1960, was marred by a multi-death collapse on June 17, 1958.  The First Narrows Bridge, better known as Lions Gate Bridge, crosses Burrard Inlet about 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) west of the Second Narrows.
The bridge is a steel truss cantilever bridge, designed by Swan Wooster Engineering Co. Ltd. Construction began in November 1957, and the bridge was officially opened on August 25, 1960.  It cost approximately $15 million to build. Tolls were charged until 1963.
The bridge is 1,292 metres (4,239 ft) long with a centre span of 335 metres (1,099 ft). It is part of the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1).


== Collapse ==

On June 17, 1958, as a crane stretched from the north side of the new bridge to join the two chords of the unfinished arch, several spans collapsed. Seventy-nine workers plunged 30 metres (98 ft) into the water. Eighteen were killed either instantly or shortly thereafter, possibly drowned by their heavy tool belts. A diver searching for bodies drowned later, bringing the total fatalities for the collapse to nineteen. In a subsequent Royal Commission inquiry, the bridge collapse was attributed to miscalculation by bridge engineers. A temporary arm, holding the fifth anchor span, was deemed too light to bear the weight.


== Renaming ==
The bridge was renamed the ""Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing"" in 1994 to honour the eighteen workers who died in the collapse, along with one rescue diver and four other workers who also died during the construction process.


== In popular culture ==
Stompin' Tom Connors paid a musical tribute to the fallen ironworkers with the song ""The Bridge Came Tumbling Down"" on his 1972 album My Stompin' Grounds. (This tune also appears on several later compilations one of which was performed by Les Claypool's Duo de Twang). Jimmy Dean's 1962 song ""Steel Men"" is a ballad about the Second Narrows bridge disaster. Gary Geddes' 2007 book of poetry, entitled Falsework, is based on the collapse of the bridge.

== Notes ==
On February 2, 2009 several University of British Columbia engineering students were arrested while attempting to suspend the shell of a Volkswagen Beetle under the bridge as part of an ""Engineering Week"" tradition.

406,Renfrew–Collingwood,"Renfrew–Collingwood is a large neighbourhood that lies on the eastern side of Vancouver,  British Columbia, Canada, on its boundary with Burnaby and encompassing an area that was one of the earlier developed regions of the city. It is a diverse area that includes a substantial business community in several areas, as well as some of the fastest-growing residential sectors of Vancouver. In 2011, the neighbourhood had a population of 50,500, 38.4% of whom claim Chinese as their first language.


== Geography ==
Renfrew–Collingwood is a large city neighbourhood, with an area of 8.2 km², that is bordered by Broadway to the north, East 41st Avenue to the south, Nanaimo Street to the west, and Boundary Road to the east. Kingsway runs through the southern part of the neighbourhood. Grandview Highway runs through the middle of Renfrew–Collingwood, carrying much of the traffic entering Vancouver from the Trans-Canada Highway during morning and evening rush hour. While much of the natural features of the area have been changed by recent development, portions of Still Creek continue to run through the area, which is built on rolling hills. The southeast corner of Renfrew–Collingwood near the intersection of Boundary Road is adjacent to Swangard Stadium and the northwest corner of Central Park.

Collingwood - The streets of Collingwood (bordered by Clarendon on the west, Tyne on the east, Kingsway to the south, and 29th to the north) do not run North, South, East, and West. In Collingwood, the Streets run northeast/southwest and Avenues run northwest/southeast. Plans from the City of Vancouver hopes to expand the Norquay Village into Vancouver's second town centre.


== History ==
In 1861, Colonel Richard Moody made the first modern attempt to break through the thick forests that covered the areas now known as Renfrew–Collingwood, building a military trail on the route of an ancient First Nations trail that led from New Westminster to English Bay. He then claimed 1.14 km² of land in the heart of the area, where the Collingwood commercial area now exists. The first settler in the area was George Wales, who moved to the area in 1878 and settled on an area bordered by Wales Street, Kingsway and East 45th Avenue.
By 1891, the interurban railway tram running along Vanness Avenue had opened the area to new residents, and a thriving community started near the junction of Vanness and Joyce Street. The name Collingwood was likely selected by some former residents of Collingwood, Ontario. However, another possibility is that the Collingwood name derives from Royal Navy Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, for whom Collingwood Channel in Howe Sound is named. In 1913, a small town was growing quickly along Joyce Street. To the north, the Renfrew district—formerly the southern part of an area known as the Hastings townsite—began to see population arrive in the 1920s.
Over the years, the two areas have grown together, with extensive commercial development along Kingsway, Grandview Highway and Boundary Road and growing numbers of condominiums and multi-family residential developments sprouting up around the area. Construction of the two SkyTrain rapid transit lines through the area (the original Expo Line in 1986 and the more recent Millennium Line to the north) has brought even more interest in development.The area had its beginnings and owes its name to a station on the now-defunct Central Park Line of the British Columbia Electric Railway, the route of which is now paralleled by the Skytrain line, the Joyce station of which is located on Joyce Avenue a few blocks north of Kingsway.


== Demographics ==


== Features ==
The wooded area around Still Creek has been preserved as Renfrew Ravine Park, and features walking trails, footbridges, and a meditation labyrinth. The neighbourhood features two public library branches (Collingwood and Renfrew), as well as a community centre and public pool at the Renfrew site. In addition, Collingwood Neighbourhood House, located at the Joyce Skytrain Station, offers programs for children and families. Norquay Park, Slocan Park and Renfrew Community Park all feature playgrounds and sports fields, and in recent years the Renfrew Ravine Moon Festival - a lantern festival - has taken place in Slocan and Renfrew Ravine parks in September. Graham Bruce, Grenfell, Carleton, Norquay, Nootka, and Renfrew are the public elementary schools in Renfrew–Collingwood; Windermere, and Vancouver Technical are its public high schools. Renfrew–Collingwood also features a private high school in the form of the Vancouver Formosa Academy, a school designed to meet the specific needs of students new to Canada. Finally, Renfrew–Collingwood features certain specialty stores which attract shoppers from across the Lower Mainland: at the corner of Kingsway and Earles, for example, the Purdy's Chocolate Factory sits across from Harvey's Appliances, and the site of the former Avalon Dairy is also nearby, just outside the Renfrew–Collingwood boundary at 43rd Avenue and Wales Street, where the original farmhouse still stands, bearing a heritage plaque.
Renfrew–Collingwood has seen a large amount of development in the past two decades, much of it coming thanks to the construction of the SkyTrain and its related stations. Three stations - Nanaimo, 29th Avenue and Joyce-Collingwood - were constructed on the 1986 Expo Line, while the Millennium Line brought the Renfrew and Rupert stations to the area. Joyce-Collingwood Station has turned into the centre of a booming residential area with condominium developments still being built around it; this area has encompassed the former Collingwood town centre, which continues to be a popular shopping area. To the north, Grandview Highway has drawn some large ""big-box"" stores and turned into an economic engine for that portion of the community. Also in that area is the busy Vancouver Film Studios operation.
Much of the heritage of both Renfrew and Collingwood has been pushed aside by progress and redevelopment, but certain heritage sites still remain - for now. The Carleton Elementary School, at the southwest corner of Kingsway and Joyce, is one example of those early days of development. The 1896 building is still standing, along with several other school buildings from the development of the area. Renfrew–Collingwood is also the home of Vancouver's only remaining craftsman style firehall, Firehall 15, at the corner of Nootka and 22nd avenues. Currently, the City of Vancouver is researching the feasibility of preserving this building, as well the historically significant 2400 motel on Kingsway, though the future of both sites is very much in doubt.
In 2007, the City of Vancouver announced the Norquay Village Neighbourhood Centre Program, one of several neighbourhood centre programs it plans to implement as part of its Eco-Density initiative. If the program goes ahead, much of Renfrew–Collingwood will be re-zoned from single-family homes to duplexes, with areas along some of the busier streets zoned for rowhouses. The idea is to increase density and encourage the development of shopping centres along Earles and Rupert streets. The plan is controversial: the city claims that density is better for the Earth's environment, but many residents do not want their neighbourhood to lose its single-family home character.
The commercial area is anchored by a Safeway supermarket adjoining which is the Eldorado Motor Hotel, and features a wide array of businesses, including a variety of ethnic-owned and ethnic-themed businesses. The area includes Kensington Gardens, the new master-planned community comprising three residential towers, a supermarket, retail shops, Asian-inspired restaurant, parks and greenspace. It was created by Vancouver-based developer Westbank. Civic services in the area include a branch of the Vancouver Public Library and recreation centre, as well as an official city neighbourhood office.

407,Balmoral Junior Secondary School,"Balmoral Junior Secondary School was a public high school in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, part of School District 44 North Vancouver.  Since the French immersion program left Balmoral Junior Secondary in 2003, that institution saw declining enrollment, to the point where the school closed in 2009. The property has since been repurposed to hold the grade 8 and 9 classes of Carson Graham Secondary while that school undergoes a facilities upgrade. The Balmoral building, redesignated as the Carson Graham Secondary Balmoral Campus, was phased out in 2012 following the completion of the work at Carson Graham.
In 2013 it became Mountainside Secondary School, an alternative school for students between grades 9 and 12.


== History ==
Balmoral Junior Secondary School opened in about 1959 to serve Grades 7, 8 and 9 students in the northwest area of the District of North Vancouver.  It was intended as a feeder to Delbrook Senior Secondary a few blocks away.  In 1969 Balmoral split the grade 10 class with Delbrook.
In January 1977 the Delbrook building was destroyed by fire, necessitating Balmoral accommodating both schools' students and staff until the end of June.  Following this, Balmoral became a feeder school to Carson Graham Secondary School.
In 2009, Balmoral ceased to exist as a separate school and became the second campus to Carson Graham Secondary School.
The Balmoral site closed in 2012 and in 2013 the school was replaced with Mountainside Secondary School, with an alternative education program.

== Athletics ==
From its opening, Balmoral was known for its superior rugby program.  Under Coach Bob Payne in the 1960s the bantam and juvenile teams often went undefeated in a season, and were unscored upon in a few.  The grade 8 and grade 9 rugby were perennial Vancouver and District champions.  In 1969 the school fielded a grade 10 boys' team for the first time.  The school has produced numerous Canada U-19 and U-21 players and, at last count, three full international senior players; Tony Scott (1973), Ron Johnstone (2001–present), and Kelly McCallum (2003).In 1997 they became only the third junior high school in the 33-year history of the B.C. High School Wrestling Championships to finish fourth.In 2007 Balmoral beat Seycove in Boys Soccer for their league junior championship.  They were the runners-up for the Vancouver and District title.


== Closure ==
In the 2006–2007 school year the North Vancouver School District put Balmoral on a list of schools slated for closure due to declining enrollment. The school parent advisory committee started a campaign to find more funding and keep the school open.
The PAC's presentations presented a strategy to keep the school open, called the International Baccalaureate Program, which was approved in 2007.In 2009, the school district twinned an immediate rebuild of Carson Graham School with the closure of Balmoral in 2012. At issue was either the construction of a seismically sound, single facility at the Carson Graham site for 1,100 students, or the maintenance of two sites, both with aging facilities and one with under 300 students.


== Drama and musical theatre program ==
Balmoral's Drama Program rivalled many others on the North Shore, second only to Sentinel Secondary School. It was headed up by Ms. A Reale with the some assistance from Tim Cadney. The program put on around 5–7 different shows each year, including spring and fall festivals.

409,George Pearson Centre,"George Pearson Centre is a long term residential care facility located in the Marpole neighbourhood of Vancouver, B.C., Canada and is currently owned and operated by Vancouver Coastal Health.
 George Pearson Centre was named after former BC Minister of Health, George S. Pearson. Built in 1952 to originally treat tuberculosis patients and then polio patients, in the 1960s the focus of George Pearson Centre changed to long term care for adults with disabilities.
George Pearson Centre now operates as a residential care facility for people with a range of disabilities. Care services are provided by Vancouver Coastal Health, food services are contracted to Sodexo, housekeeping services to Compass Group Canada, laundry to K-Bro Linen.


== History ==
The 264-bed building originally opened on May 14, 1952 as George Pearson Tuberculosis Hospital to treat people with Tuberculosis (TB). The plans to build Pearson predated World War II but were delayed by the war. The cost of building was $1,800,000. The first patients arrived before the grand opening. On April 9, 1952 nine Japanese men arrived; they had been waiting seven years in a Japanese internment camp hospital for a bed. TB rates were declining due to advances in treatment and antibiotics. In 1955, the Polio Pavilion was added for polio patients. From 1963 to 1965 about 130 patients were transferred to Pearson Hospital from the nearby Marpole and Haney infirmaries. Marpole Infirmary building was condemned and Haney facility became a treatment centre for people with alcohol addiction. When these new patients came to George Pearson, they brought with them the Marpole Women's Auxiliary a charity that continues to donate to and support the residents who reside there today.In 1966 the focus officially changed to long-term care, although since TB patients were not seen as long-term cases, the building was not built with permanent residents in mind. Other TB hospitals were closing including Coqualeetza TB hospital, formerly Canada's second largest residential school. Located near Chilliwack, Coqualeetza transferred their last TB patients to Pearson Hospital in Vancouver in 1968.The 1970s saw an increase in spinal cord injuries resulting from traffic and recreational activities. Tuberculosis and polio were now considered far less of a public health threat.
In May 1980 the Stan Stronge Pool opened.There have been several owners/operators of this facility over the years. April 1984 the B.C. Government divested itself of Pearson Hospital, the province's last hospital. Pearson Hospital, along with G.F. Strong Rehabilitation Centre was now owned and operated by the Western Rehabilitation Society.  In Aug 1989, the Western Rehabilitation Society was renamed BC Rehabilitation Society (BC Rehab) and Pearson Hospital was renamed George Pearson Centre.
BC Ministry of Health created the Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre (VHHSC) by merging Vancouver General Hospital and University of British Columbia (UBC) Hospital. In late 1997, G. F. Strong Centre and George Pearson Centre were merged into the VHHSC.In 2001, the BC government created five health authorities including Vancouver Coastal Health Authority (later renamed to simply Vancouver Coastal Health) and George Pearson Centre came under the new health authority's management.


== Residents of GPC ==
Adults of all ages live at George Pearson Centre (GPC) from different places, and require care for many different reasons. Some people live at GPC for decades, while others live there for a short period of time. 
Many residents have extensive physical disability and some require respiratory care including using a ventilator. Residents of GPC collaborated on creating a website, launched in 2010. GPC celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2012 with a 1950s themed party and an Open House. Past residents and staff returned to visit with those still living and working at GPC.
A resident of GPC, Dan LeBlanc, had his own torch relay, after a medical emergency derailed his part in the 2010 Paralympic torch relay.Over the years, people have raised concerns about living conditions at George Pearson Centre and institutional living in general.


== Features of GPC ==
The Stan Stronge Pool is a therapeutic pool attached to GPC, used by both GPC residents and community members. It is a heated swimming pool with ramps and hoists that allow complete access for people with disabilities, many who cannot use public swimming pools.Farmers on 57th  is a community group that started Community Gardens and a small productive farm in 2009, sponsored by the BC Coalition of People with Disabilities (BCCPD) now known as Disability Alliance of BC (DABC), on the VCH-owned site where George Pearson Centre is located. Clown Doctors have worked with residents of George Pearson Centre since May 2009, with Jest for Joy. The program is modeled after the Fools for Health program in Windsor. Since the 1960s, the Marpole Women's Auxiliary has raised funds to benefit the residents of GPC.


== Redevelopment ==
In April 2009, the City of Vancouver approved a planning process for VCH to consult with the community and stakeholders on the redevelopment of the 10-hectare (25.4 acre) land on which both George Pearson Centre and neighbouring seniors home Dogwood Lodge are located.
The process was delayed and began in late 2012. A series of Open Houses were held jointly by VCH and the City of Vancouver as part of the public consultation process. The land value is estimated to be over 100 million dollars. When the policy proposal went to Vancouver City Council for approval in January 2013, it was referred for further discussion in response to the many people who spoke out against the plan. Concerns were raised by the City's own Persons with Disabilities Advisory Committee as well as community members and disability rights advocates. Several representatives of the groups bringing concerns forward met with VCH planners and a revised policy plan was agreed upon by most parties. It was approved by Vancouver City Council on Feb 5, 2014 and moved onto the next stages of planning.While in 2013 about 230 people live on the Pearson-Dogwood 25 acre land, estimates of the future population of this site range up to six thousand people and in buildings up to 28 stories high. As the planning process went on, concern grew about the planned increase in density.

410,LANcouver,"LANcouver was a LAN party first hosted on the North Shore of Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  It was started in January 2004 and has hosted seven successful events, with the last event in July 2011.  The event has attracted an average of approximately 50–120 attendees per event.  LANcouver is a BYOC (Bring Your Own Computer) event, which means that everyone attending brings their own PC desktop or laptop.  Network resources (such as switches and network cable) and power connections are supplied and connected by the administrators on-site during the event, who also host the various servers required for playing LAN based games such as Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Source, and Unreal Tournament. LANcouver organizers have also been responsible for running tournaments at other events such as GottaCon 2012.


== 2006 World Cyber Games event ==
LANcouver 6 was a registered World Cyber Games qualifying event, and hosted qualifying tournaments for the national championships.  The qualifying matches hosted at LANcouver events were:

Warcraft III: Frozen Throne
Starcraft: Brood War
Counter Strike 1.6
FIFA 2006 (PC)


== LANcouver 2011 ==
In late 2010, LANcouver founders announced that an event was in the works for some time in 2011. In early 2011, that year's LANcouver event was announced, making it the first time that a year was given to the title rather than a number. LANcouver 2011 was the 7th event and was planned to be much larger than all previous events, while also incorporating other game types not played on computers such as Xbox 360 tournaments, Warhammer 40,000 events, and Magic: The Gathering and other TCG (trading card game) events.
LANcouver 2011 was held at the Great Northern Way Campus; another first for the event is that it was hosted in the City of Vancouver proper and not a suburb.
The main PC gaming events for LANcouver 2011 were Starcraft II, Counter-Strike: Source and League of Legends. Console events were held as well, with the following main tournaments: Marvel vs Capcom 3, Call of Duty: Black Ops & Super Smash Bros. Brawl


== LANcouver 2012 presented by ASUS ==
LANcouver 2012 was announced in late March 2012 and was held at the Richmond Olympic Oval, just outside Vancouver in neighboring Richmond, BC. Sponsors included ASUS (Presenting), NCIX (Retail Sponsor), Kingston Technology, Antec, Shaw Cablesystems, Compu2000, ROCCAT, and more.
The event was host to three major tournaments: League of Legends (5v5), StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty (1v1) and Counter-Strike Global Offensive (5v5). The top Canadian StarCraft II player received a trip to Toronto for 2012's World Championship Series qualifier, and competed to win a spot on Team Canada for the World Finals later that year, in addition to a top-end ASUS gaming notebook.
Attendance was approximately 175 out of 200 BYOC spots, and over 150 spectators attended throughout the weekend.


== LANcouver 2013 presented by NCIX ==
In March 2013, LANcouver organizers revealed that the 9th event would be held at the NCIX Warehouse in Richmond, BC, and that the event would also be title sponsored by NCIX. The departure from the Richmond Olympic Oval allows for several key factors from 2012 to be addressed, such as the lack of darkness during nighttime hours. It was also announced that NCIX would be holding a Warehouse Sale simultaneously, with early ticket purchasers for LANcouver getting early access to the NCIX sale.
Tournaments in 2013 included League of Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, StarCraft, and others. New for 2013 were VIP seats, advertised as being in a ""special seating area"" and with features like privacy curtains, reduced noise, better seating and complementary refreshments. Other new features included a live broadcast of the LANcouver University panel sessions, improved networking, and an increase in prizing for the entire event. Nvidia's Shield Portable handheld gaming system had its Western Canada debut at LANcouver, and attendees were able to try the new system before it went on sale.


== LANcouver 2014 and 2015 ==
In April 2014, rumours surfaced that LANcouver organizers had been planning a special 10th anniversary for 2014. The event would also be the 10th since founding. Speculations included a 350-seat BYOC, multi-genre gaming, console tournament, or even live finals for a major international eSports event. In late 2014 it was revealed that LANcouver would miss out on hosting an event for that year, with a followup to be provided in 2015. In Spring of 2015 it was revealed that a 10th LANcouver event is in full planning for late 2015. Several reasons were given for the lack of an event in 2014, mainly concerning the organizer's personal schedule (LANcouver is run by one person) as well as difficulty securing an adequate venue within budget requirements.

411,Second Narrows Bridge,"The Second Narrows Rail Bridge is a vertical-lift railway bridge that crosses the Burrard Inlet and connects Vancouver with the North Shore. The bridge's south end connects directly to the Thornton Tunnel, which connects it to the main Canadian rail network. As the name suggests, it is located at the second narrowing of the Burrard Inlet.


== History ==


=== Background ===
During the Klondike Gold Rush, there were schemes to build a railway from Vancouver to the Dawson gold fields. The first stage in this would be to bridge Burrard Inlet and then build a railway north. John Hendry floated the Vancouver, Westminster, and Yukon Railway which built a line from Ladner to New Westminster and then to Vancouver via Burnaby Lake. This line was paired with the Great Northern Railway who also wanted trackage into Vancouver.
In the process, various other railroads all became involved in the bridging scheme: the Canadian Northern Railway, Milwaukee Road, and the Pacific Great Eastern Railway. The bridge itself would be owned by the Federal Government as they had control of harbours and shipping, and would lease access to the railways as they did with the rail bridge in New Westminster. One of the main reasons was that there was very little space on the south shore for wharves, thus railways wanted to develop the North Shore as the south side was occupied by another railway, the Canadian Pacific. A company was floated, the Burrard Inlet Bridge and Tunnel Company, and contracts were issued to span the tidal bore. At one point, a causeway was planned to dam the narrows and create bridges and wharves that way.
World War I intervened, as did the bankruptcy of all the interested railways. With it went dreams of the bridge and rails up Indian Arm, the Capilano valley, or via Howe Sound. However, the predecessor railways did sign contracts to build
a bridge and a new Hotel Vancouver. Only after the war with huge increase in funding to improve harbours around the British Empire, partly due to problems associated with wartime shipping, did funds appear for the completion of the 1925 bridge. And so the north shore port became an amalgam of operations with Canadian National, Pacific Great Eastern and Harbour and Wharves Commission all using the bridge when it was not out of service. North Vancouver ferries operated at this time as well.
The essential wartime shipyards in North Vancouver underscored the need for reliable industrial access. Further, the expansion of Lynnterm, Wheat elevators, coal and the sulphur port in the 1960s indicated the growing use of the North Shore.


=== Original bridge (1925) ===
The original Second Narrows Bridge was constructed in 1925, and was the first bridge to connect Vancouver with the North Shore over the tidal bore of the narrows. This bridge was constructed, by John Stewart and Northern Construction, with a car deck and a year later in 1926 trains began using the bridge as well. After being hit by a number of ships and being out of service for 4 years, in 1933 the provincial government bought the bridge and installed a lift section of the deck.
In 1960, a new much larger and higher 6-lane Second Narrows Bridge with a 350-metre (1,150 ft) span was completed alongside the original bridge, and the original bridge was converted exclusively for rail use. In 1994, the new road bridge was renamed the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing in honour of the ironworkers who died in accidents while building it. However, the new bridge is still commonly referred to as the Second Narrows Bridge.


=== Second bridge (1968) ===
In 1968, the original 1926 railbridge was replaced by CN Rail with a larger, higher lift bridge. A bridgetender activates cables and counterweights to raise the span. Unless moving a train across Burrard Inlet, the lift section is always in the up position to allow ships to go underneath.
The current bridge has a vertical clearance of 46 metres (151 ft) at the main lift span fully raised (open position). The vertical lift section of the Second Narrows Railway Bridge provides 137 metres (449 ft) clear navigation width between rubbing fenders. However, the Ironworkers Second Narrows road bridge has a vertical clearance of 44 metres (144 ft) and the shipping channel where the maximum vertical clearance is available is 110 metres (360 ft) wide.


== Chronology of the bridges ==

1902 V. W. and Y Railway completed to Burnaby. Bridge Planned.
1910 Burrard Inlet Bridge and Tunnel Company plans floated.
1912 Land speculation on North Shore, subject to completion of bridge.
1914 Railway to Deep Cove and Port Moody planned.
1915 Market Collapse; P. G. E Railway bankrupt.
1916 Causeway planned; Canadian Northern bankrupt.
1925: A smaller, lower bridge is completed, than originally envisioned.
1926: Trains began using the bridge.
1927: A freighter, the Eurana, hits the bridge on March 10, causing almost $80,000 worth of damage.
1928: Hit by the SS Norwich City.
1930: The Losmar hits the south span.
1930: On September 13, the barge Pacific Gatherer becomes wedged under the bridge's fixed centre span. The tide rose pushing the barge up under the span, knocking it off its supports. The span hung off one side before suddenly breaking free and sinking into the depths of Burrard Inlet. Lawsuits and the bankruptcy of the Bridge company delayed any attempt at repairs. The bridge remained closed for four years.
1933: Sold to the Provincial government. Repairs began.
1934: Reopened, replacing the bascule with a centre lift span.
1963: Closed to highway traffic and sold to the CNR for $1.
1968: New, larger lift bridge is built immediately to the east of the 1926 Bridge.
1969: Thornton Tunnel is dug for CN trains to connect with line at Willingdon.
1970: Old 1926 bridge is removed, as are cement piers.
1979: October, Japanese freighter ""Japan Erica"" carrying logs collides with the bridge in heavy fog knocking a section of the bridge just north of the lift span into the water. The bridge is closed until March 4, 1980.

412,Phibbs Exchange,"Phibbs Exchange is the major transit exchange for the District of North Vancouver, British Columbia. Part of the TransLink system, it is home to routes serving North Vancouver and some parts of the city of Vancouver. Opened on October 19, 1973, it is one of the four major transit exchanges on the North Shore (the others being Capilano University Exchange, Lonsdale Quay and Park Royal Exchange). The exchange is named after Charles J.P. Phibbs.


== Structure and location ==
Phibbs Exchange is located directly next to the northern foot of the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge, which connects North Vancouver to East Vancouver and Burnaby. It can accommodate regular-length and articulated diesel buses and community shuttle buses only.
The exchange is also located a short distance from Capilano University and North Shore Studios. The Pacific National Exhibition grounds is also nearby, just across the bridge in Vancouver. The exchange is located next to a park and ride facility.
Security at Phibbs Exchange is the responsibility of the Transit Security Department.  Transit Security Officers can be found making random patrols of the exchange and conducting Fare Inspections on board buses.  North Vancouver RCMP also make random patrols of the exchange.  Bus drivers also have the ability to call for Transit Security in the event of an incident.

415,Ideal Mini School,"Ideal Mini School is a public secondary mini school in Vancouver, British Columbia. It is a complete grade 8–12 high school program. It is generally accepted as the ""steward school"" of Sir Winston Churchill Secondary, although was run independently under the leadership of head teacher Jim King, who retired and was replaced by Ernie Pao in September 2014.


== Entrance ==
An English and cognitive skills test is taken by prospective students as part of the application process. Community service, marks, and extra-curriculars are also considered for entrance. Interviews with the students narrow down applicants further.


== Program ==
Other than for its size, Ideal differs from Churchill Secondary because of its enriched approach to learning. It offers an intimate and creative environment, and utilizes an informal, unique teaching style where the teachers are addressed by their first names and trust is highly regarded. Integration among grades, expression and leadership are extremely common and promoted with ""school meetings"". There are six classrooms in the school, which is currently attended by approximately 125 students from Grade 8 to 12.
Students at Ideal may join sports teams at Churchill Secondary, as well as clubs, and elective classes in Grade 11 and 12.
Since 2008, Ideal has been holding an annual science fair. As of late 2009, Ideal features an advanced Moodle course management system that provides students access to online learning discussions and resources.


== History ==
Ideal School was established in 1972 by teacher Garry Nixon, who was teaching at St. George's School at the time. It was intended to be an independent, alternative high school. The Province reported that ""[t]o be admitted, boys and girls must convince Nixon they sincerely want to learn and are willing to work harder than would be required in other schools"", and that it would cost $60 a month in fees. Nixon published a job posting in The Vancouver Sun, promising prospective teachers ""freedom, fascination and abject poverty"". Six teachers comprised the original staff, chosen from a pool of over 60 applicants, and with much lower salaries than what could be expected at a public school. Ideal School was originally housed in the Vancouver Fancy Sausage Factory, on 16th Avenue and Heather Street. The blood gutters had to be cleaned out before the staff and students could move in. Faced with financial difficulties, in 1974 the school approached the Vancouver School Board for economic support.

Once absorbed by the Vancouver School Board, the tuition was removed and teacher salaries were increased. It was temporarily relocated to Sir William Dawson School on Helmcken Street (which closed in 1972, and was used by Ideal and City School, another alternative program, from 1974 to 1977). It was placed under the administration of King George Secondary School, and prospered for two years with help from the school board, which advertised for it to maintain enrolment, reportedly spending approximately $1,700 between 1974 and 1977. In November 1975, a research report released by a member of the Board of School Trustees reported around 100 students and five teachers. It claimed that the students benefited from their experience at Ideal due to freedom to participate in school decisions, dedicated teachers, and low student–teacher ratio, while criticizing the building and the lack of facilities and equipment.

On April 21, 1976, the school board stated that Ideal was to be moved to Lord Byng Secondary School. A parent–student committee was formed to discuss the situation, which presented arguments against the move to the school board, claiming that its independence was necessary to maintain students' individuality and creativity. The committee succeeded in convincing the board to withdraw its decision. On October 4, 1976, a board official stated that the move to Lord Byng was being reconsidered, but the committee succeeded once more in convincing the board against the relocation. However, on December 6, 1976, the board announced their irreversible decision to perform the move before February 1, 1977, as the Dawson School building was considered to be expensive to maintain. Ideal School was to occupy three classrooms at Byng, and students were told that they could either accept the move or be dispersed among Vancouver high schools. On January 4, 1977, Ideal students protested in front of the Vancouver School Board.It was agreed that the school board would assess Ideal's situation at Lord Byng for six months, and if the accommodation was deemed inadequate, it would be relocated again. Lord Byng and Ideal did not co-exist well, and parents and students wrote complaint letters to the media.Relocation to the former site of L'École Bilingue Elementary in Shannon Park was considered, but residents of the area disapproved of the presence of a secondary school. Eventually, Ideal was relocated to 855 West 59th Avenue.In 1995, Ideal Mini School came in first in British Columbia provincial exam results for English 12 and second (the first being University Hill Secondary School) in English Literature 12.Vancouver School Board budget cuts in 2010 threatened mini schools, including Ideal, resulting in student protests.

417,Seymour River (Burrard Inlet),"The Seymour River is a river in North Vancouver, British Columbia which is notable for being several degrees warmer than other streams and lakes in the area.  This is due to it being fed from a large reservoir backed up behind a dam from which a constant flow of water is released. The upper portion of the river and the reservoir are part of the Seymour watershed, controlled by Metro Vancouver.
The Seymour River has been the main water supply for North Vancouver since 1907.  The first intake was built in 1907 and the first Seymour Dam was constructed in 1927.  The present day Seymour Falls Dam was constructed 1961. Up to 40,000 fed coho fry are released above the dam each year by the Seymour Salmonid Society.
The hydrometric data for this river is presented by the Water Survey of Canada.


== Seymour River Suspension Bridge ==
As of December 20, 2018, the new Seymour River Suspension Bridge were opened and once again, the hiking and mountain biking trails on the east and west sides of the river are connected. This includes trails such as the Fisherman’s Trail and the hiking route connecting multiple trails known as Two Canyon Loop.

418,Sentinel Secondary School,"Sentinel Secondary School is a secondary school located in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is one of three public secondary schools in the West Vancouver district (SD #45) including West Vancouver Secondary School and Rockridge Secondary School. The school has a grass field, two baseball diamonds, three street hockey courts, and three tennis courts. The main field is used for all sports, such as soccer, football, and rugby.
The school was established for the 1962–63 school year with students who had previously attended Hillside Secondary School. The first classes were held in the old Inglewood School until the new building was completed in 1963. The first grade 12 graduating class was in 1965.


== Advanced Placement Program ==
Sentinel offers Advanced Placement Program (AP) courses, teaching material equivalent to university-level study. All of the courses require a strong comprehension of general knowledge and excellent work habits. It requires a powerful intellectual commitment to perseverance and solid, foundational work habits, and are regarded as more rigorous than the general offerings. Pre-AP courses are offered to students wishing to prepare for the full Advanced Placement offerings in their Senior School years. Sentinel offers AP classes in French, psychology, calculus, physics, biology, chemistry, language, literature, fine arts, and many more. Students in both grade 11 and 12 are allowed to enroll in AP courses.
Although Sentinel provides numerous AP courses, it is noteworthy that there are a lot of restrictions that the school makes implicit and ambiguous; these restrictions can be problematic for some students as they can significantly affect the entire timeline of students' plans for participating AP exams. Firstly, since the students are not capable of registering for the AP exams individually, the students have no choice but to follow the instructions the school gives. For example, students who are taking AP Physics 1 class are not able to write the AP Physics 1 exam as the school requires students to take AP Physics 2 in their second year in order to receive the AP Physics 1 exam; in this case, the students can only take the AP Physics 1 exam at Sentinel in their second year of AP Physics. As a result, there is a chance that the students will not have their AP exam scores even if they have finished related AP courses when they file applications to universities. Similarly, students cannot write the exams at Sentinel for courses that they are not taking at the school. Also, the school hosts some AP classes, while a few of the related exams are not provided at Sentinel. Students who take AP courses at Sentinel are required to write the related AP exams at Sentinel Secondary; otherwise, they will be taken out of their AP class and either not receive credits for that course or receive credits for the equivalent non-AP course. The Capstone program is a university-level AP course offered by Sentinel Secondary for English language and literature. It is a research-based program where students get the opportunity to look into a topic of their choice and create a presentation for the class. By allowing students to pick their own material, students have more freedom and are more invested and interested in their learning. The courses provide guidelines for essay writing and citations that will be needed throughout their university education.


== Premier Academies and Pursuit Programme ==
Sentinel is also home to various West Vancouver Schools Premier Academies which specialize in specific sports or activities including the Premier:  

Animation Academy
Ballet Academy
Baseball Academy
Basketball Academy
Dance Academy
Engineering Academy
Environmental Science Academy
Fencing Academy
Field Hockey Academy
Hockey Academy
Mechatronics Robotics Academy
Outdoor Connections Academy
Rugby Academy
Soccer Academy
Table Tennis Academy
Tennis Academy
Volleyball AcademyThe programs integrate training of the academy topic into the course-load - students spend 2 blocks out of 8 in their academy. They train in this activity the last block of every day. For example, the hockey academy members: are on ice three times per week, once they are in the classroom (learning theory of the sport/nutrition/other), and once at Twist Conditioning or the North Shore Winter Club. 
Sentinel also offers the Pursuit Programme (formerly known as Super Achievers) which provides similar benefits for students participating in sports or certain activities at a provincial/national level which is not listed in the Premier Academies (e.g. acrobatics, ballet, rock climbing). In this program, students have the opportunity to take regular classes in the morning and focus on their area of specialization in the afternoon.


== Arts Programmes ==

Sentinel has a diverse music programme which differentiates from that of other schools. It has a regular stage/jazz band typically for students grades 10–11, a classical orchestra which encompasses all grades, and a unique Rhythm and Blues band usually reserved for those in grades 11–12 by audition. The latter is a band that plays songs by artists such as James Brown, Aretha Franklin, and bands such as Tower of Power. Students learn songs by ear from the original recordings rather than from sheet music. This band not only plays for school events but also at many community events throughout the year. A number of videos of the Sentinel Rhythm and Blues Band are currently available on YouTube.Sentinel's theatre program, SentinelStage is recognized as one of the best school theatre programs in the North Shore. While its theatre program continues to top the North Shore, its lack of capable members after the graduation of its 2015 class, has been described by local media as ""a disappointment"".


== French Immersion ==
Sentinel also offers French Immersion, with École Pauline Johnson being one of the feeder schools. Sentinel offers bilingual instruction to students enrolled in the French Immersion program.  Immersion is for students who have received their primary and intermediate level of instruction in French. As students progress through each year, the percentage of classes in French lessens. 


== Motto ==
The school motto, Summis Cum Animis, is Latin for ""with the greatest possible spirit."" It was proposed along with a new silver and blue shield logo, by the late Fred Robinson (died 1999), longtime teacher of English and Latin, in 1988 to replace the original motto ""Servo"" (""I serve""), in part because, Robinson advised, the verb ""servo, servire"" has connotations of slavery. At the same time, Robinson proposed replacing the school colours (brown and white) with the current blue and silver.

419,J. W. Sexsmith Elementary School,"J.W. Sexsmith Community Elementary is a public elementary school in Vancouver, British Columbia part of School District 39 Vancouver.


== History ==
John Wesley Sexsmith was born in Richmond, County of Lennox, Ontario on May 10, 1830, to parents who were both members of United Empire Loyalist families. Educated in the common schools of Ontario, Sexsmith entered the lumber business and also tried his hand as a general merchant and established a cheese factory. Sexsmith soon encountered financial hardships and decided to try out his fortune in the West.
Mr. Sexsmith's westward journey eventually brought him to a plot of land on what was then known as Lulu Island. Drawing from his experience back in Ontario, Sexsmith established a cheese factory and soon grew so successful that he extended his land holdings to some 1,900 acres (7.7 km2) on Lulu Island as well as several hundred acres in modern-day Pitt Meadows. To overcome transportation difficulties, Sexsmith established a boat service on the North Fraser River to New Westminster.
As the population of the area gradually increased, Sexsmith became active in the organization of the district into the Municipality of Richmond and served as its Reeve. For a number of years, Sexsmith was largely responsible for the building of bridges to join Marpole, Sea Island and Lulu Island.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Sexsmith was actively involved in teaching. Mrs. Sexsmith, one of the first teachers in the area with professional qualifications, taught at a school in Gastown provided by the Moodyville Lumber Company. Mr. Sexsmith established a Ryerson System school to provide education for the surrounding families. The school was one of the first of the strictly rural schools established on the mainland of British Columbia.
In February 2016, the original J.W. Sexsmith School was torn down.  On October 13th, 2013 the new building was officially opened at the back of the schoolground. A new road was put in that connects Columbia St. The new address for the school is J.W. Sexsmith School, 7410 Columbia St, Vancouver, BC V5X
Every other year, Sexsmith Elementary puts on a play put on by the students of Sexsmith in grades 6 and 7 and organized and directed by two teachers of the school. In the past, these plays have been, The Wizard of Oz, The Lion King, Aladdin and more. 3C1The building resides on the lands of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh, Coast Salish people.

422,Marpole,"Marpole, originally a Musqueam village named c̓əsnaʔəm, is a mostly residential neighbourhood of 23,832 in 2011, located on the southern edge of the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, immediately northeast of Vancouver International Airport. It is approximately bordered by Angus Drive to the west, 57th Avenue to the north, Fraser Street to the east and the Fraser River to the south. It has undergone many changes in the 20th century, with the influx of traffic and development associated with the construction of the Oak Street Bridge (which leads to Highway 99 leading to the southern suburbs) and the Arthur Laing Bridge (which leads to Vancouver International Airport).


== History ==
Marpole is one of Vancouver's oldest communities. The Great Marpole Midden, an ancient Musqueam village and burial site, one of North America's largest village sites and ""one of the largest pre-contact middens on the Pacific coast of Canada"", has been a National Historic Site since 1933. According to the Musqueam, it dates back at least 4,000 years.A long-house dated to the year 5 AD was located near modern Marine Drive, in South Vancouver, belonging to the Ancient Marpole First Nation.
Non-natives began to inhabit the area in the 1860s, calling it Eburne Station. The small town was separated from the city by miles of forest.
At the turn of the 20th century, the Vancouver Lulu Island Railway of the British Columbia Electric Railway interurban train were constructed, which triggered the development of sawmills, shingle mills and gravel companies in the region. The area was renamed after Richard Marpole in 1916, and by the time it joined Vancouver in 1929, it had become one of the area's major industrial centres.

The Oak Street Bridge was completed in 1957 and was partly responsible for a downturn in business around the Marine and Hudson area, as traffic shifted to the east. The 1975 opening of the Arthur Laing Bridge helped shift the business area back to the west, along Granville Street.


== Transportation ==
Because of the Oak and Arthur Laing Bridges, traffic jams are common in the area, especially during peak hours. However, it is well-served by public transit (which is run by TransLink and operated by Coast Mountain Bus Company) mostly because almost all the buses going to the southern suburbs pass through Marpole at some point.
In September 2009, the Canada Line replaced most of the suburban routes and the 98 B-Line. It runs along Cambie Street, and has a station at Marine Drive, with a future station at 57th Avenue.Marpole is also directly across the Fraser River from Vancouver International Airport, located on Sea Island in Richmond, which is the second busiest airport in Canada.


== Demographics ==
37% of Marpole residents’ mother tongue was one of the two forms of Chinese (Mandarin & Cantonese) and 42% of the area's populace identified as Chinese in 2006. Fifty-nine percent of the population of Marpole was born outside of Canada.


== Economy ==
Most of Marpole's stores are centred along the southern end of Granville Street. There are small corner shops located on Oak Street and 67th, and on Cambie at 57th. A number of businesses, ranging from drive-through fast-food eateries to big box stores, manufacturers and distributors are also located along Marine Drive east of the Arthur Laing bridge, with more heavy-industry type businesses are located along the banks of the Fraser River. Just west of the Arthur Laing bridge is the old Fraser Arms Hotel, now a strip mall and liquor store. Just west of the Fraser Arms is the approximate location of the Great Marpole Midden .  The West 70th Avenue area is currently undergoing some revitalization, with the redevelopment of the Safeway grocery store, partnered with residential condo towers.
Another large commercial district has been approved for Marpole, which will be in the eastern portion of the neighbourhood. The intersection of Marine Drive and Cambie Street was designated by the City of Vancouver as the ""Marine Landing"" precinct of the Cambie Corridor (Marine Landing Precinct). Two  developments in the Marine Landing precinct have been approved and are currently under construction. ""Marine Gateway"" Marine Gateway which will sit atop the Marine Drive Station, will provide two residential towers, one office tower and a large amount of commercial and retail space, including movie theatres and a grocery store. The second development, MC2 on the North East corner of the intersection will provide two residential towers and a small amount of retail at the ground level.  The third site,  (the old Petro-Can station) on the North West corner was finished in 2018, and hosts high rise condominiums anchored by ground level retail services.


== Education ==
There are six elementary schools in the Marpole area. These include:

David Lloyd George Elementary School
Sir Wilfrid Laurier Elementary School
Laurier Annex
McKechnie Elementary School
J. W. Sexsmith Elementary School
St. Anthony of Padua Independent Catholic SchoolStrictly speaking, there are no high schools which fall within Marpole's borders, however Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School sits just across 57th Avenue in Oakridge and serves the majority of the neighbourhood. Magee Secondary School serves the western portion of the neighbourhood.
Note that the Laurier Annex closed since 2017 and its students merged with Laurier Elementary.


== Healthcare ==
George Pearson Centre is located in Marpole. It is a centre that specializes with adults with disabilities who require special assistance.  This site is also undergoing a redevelopment program.


== Joy Kogawa's Obasan ==
Joy Kogawa's bestselling novel, Obasan, which tells the story of Canada's internment and persecution of its citizens of Japanese descent during World War II, partially takes place in Marpole, in a tiny bungalow located at 1450 West 64th Avenue. Joy Kogawa (née Nakayama, born 1935) lived there as a child, and in 2006 the house was purchased by The Land Conservancy of British Columbia following a nationwide fundraising campaign. The 1912 house stands as a cultural and historical reminder of the war-time experience of Canadians of Japanese heritage, who were interned in remote camps and their property expropriated during World War II.
Today, the Historic Joy Kogawa House Society, a community-based group of arts supporters, operates a writer-in-residence program at the house with a long-term from new owners, the City of Vancouver. The writer-in-residence program has been under way since 2009 and during that time has enriched the literary community and fostered an appreciation for Canadian writing by bringing well-regarded professional writers in touch with a local community of writers, readers, and students. The writer-in-residence program celebrates the work of Joy Kogawa, which brought the war-time experience of Japanese-Canadians to general awareness among Canadians.


== Winona Park ==
Winona Park is a park in the Marpole neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, just south of the Langara golf course. It has 3 levels, each being the size of a football field. Unlike many similar parks which contain large grass fields, Winona Park is not attached to any community centre or school. Combined with the fact that it is situated in an area which consists mostly of low density residential housing, and the fact that organized sports clubs require an explicit permit for use of the fields, Winona Park is relatively calm as attendance is low, providing individual or couples a haven of privacy and peace.
In addition to the three parallel fields mentioned above, the park also features a small children's playground which consists of a slide, several bars, a tire swing, and 4 swings. It is notable that due to the terracing of the three fields and the natural southern aspect of the land in the area, there is a spectacular southern view featuring the North Arm Fraser River and into the Richmond delta. It is said that on a clear day with minimal smog interference, one is able to see tens and tens of kilometres into the distance. Also, since most of the park is composed of grass expanses to accommodate the fields, a light breeze is present even on mostly windless days, granting users of the park relief from the heat of the summer sun. The park is not without shade, however, as there are large trees planted in a linear fashion between each of the fields/levels of the park.

423,First Lutheran Church (Vancouver),"The First Lutheran Church is a Lutheran Church located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It gained local prominence in 2009 when Mikhail Lennikov, an ex-KGB officer, sought refuge within the church to avoid deportation back to his native Russia. He lived in the church with his family for six years before voluntarily leaving Canada in 2015. However, half a year later a federal court overturned the ruling that rejected his request for humanitarian asylum, allowing him to return to the country.

427,British Properties,"Orginally known as Capilano Estates, the British Properties is a residential area in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The 4,000 acre area was sold by the municipality of West Vancouver to the British Pacific Properties corporation in 1931, which continues to develop the land to the present day.The development is credited with starting West Vancouver's slow transformation from a ferry-access only, resort-style beachside enclave into a leafy suburban community with roads, parks, and shopping centres.


== History ==
In 1931, the British Pacific Properties, a corporation consisting of a group of investors led by the Guinness brewing company, acquired 4,000 acres of land from the municipality of West Vancouver stretching from the Capilano River to Horseshoe Bay. The land was purchased during the Great Depression, when the municipality was nearing bankruptcy due to residents being unable to pay property taxes. The Guinness family, led by Walter Guinness committed to funding $1 million in local improvements over a five-year period and constructing the Lions Gate Bridge. The corporation ended up paying $75,000 to the municipality for the land with the agreement of $1 million in improvements.

The original landscaping was designed by the prestigious Olmsted Brothers landscape architecture firm from Boston. Olmsted Brothers was founded by Frederick Law Olmsted—the father of North American landscape architecture and the creator of Central Park in Manhattan, Mount Royal in Montreal, and the innovative Riverside suburb in West Chicago.


== Ethnic restrictions ==
The neighbourhood was known for its strict whites-only policy. Property titles including covenants such as barring sales to ""any person or persons of African or Asiatic race or of African or Asiatic descent."" Jewish people were also excluded, although, eventually, the first synagogue in West Vancouver was built opposite the entrance to the British Properties. In modern times, the resident population is diverse due to the property values and other factors attracting Asian and other international investors. It is said that residents are just as likely to speak Persian or Mandarin as they are to speak English.

431,Burnaby Heights,"Burnaby Heights, often referred to as The Heights, is a quiet, prestigious, residential neighbourhood in North Burnaby between Boundary Road to the west, Gamma Avenue to the east and bounded by Hastings Street to the south. Its northern edge facing the North Shore Mountains comes down rather steeply to the shores of Burrard Inlet.
Many community events, such as Hats Off Day, Halloween on the Heights and Light up the Heights are held annually.  


== Heritage homes ==
Burnaby Heights has a significant number of heritage houses.

		
		
		
		
		
		
		


== Christmas on the Heights ==
It has become an annual tradition to light up the local stretch of Hastings Street during the Christmas season, which certainly makes it more attractive for the shoppers and commuters in this dark time of year. The lights are installed and maintained by the City of Burnaby and light up the heights from November to March each year. 

		
		
		


== Traffic Issues ==
In February 2009, in response to the petitions of various Burnaby heights residents, Burnaby City Council initiated a process to review the traffic issues in the Burnaby Heights neighbourhood.

433,University Golf Club,"The University Golf Club is a public golf club located in Pacific Spirit Regional Park near the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and the University of British Columbia.  It is owned and operated by Musqueam Capital Corporation. 


== History of the club ==
University Golf Club was designed by A.V. Macan, and was opened as a public course in 1929 by John Boyd. It was originally named Westward Ho!, but the club became known to the public by its current name soon after. The project was originally estimated to have cost little more than $70,000 to $80,000 to complete.Currently the club does not offer membership of any kind, hence the club's motto: Non-members only.


== 2007 potential close ==
The future of the course had at one point been called into question, according to an article in the Vancouver Sun newspaper published on June 27, 2007. The local Musqueam Indian Band was attempting to buy the land which the course occupies in order to build housing, however there is a land use covenant in place restricting the use of the land to a golf course for a ""long-term period"". The Musqueam Band offered in 2003 to buy the course on the understanding that it would honour the land use covenant.

435,Capilano River Regional Park,"Capilano River Regional Park is located in the District of North Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada. It is one of twenty-one regional parks operated by the Metro Vancouver. The park encompasses most of the upstream areas of the Capilano River below the Cleveland Dam. The area north of the dam surrounding Capilano Lake is closed to the public as it is a GVRD watershed. The privately operated Capilano Suspension Bridge crosses the river, but it is not within park boundaries and does not access the park. 


== Attractions ==

Capilano River Regional Park is most commonly associated with the Cleveland Dam.  Admission to the dam is free, and one can walk across the dam and observe the river and the spillway. Formed above the dam, Capilano Lake stores the river's waters, stretching north for more than five kilometres. The lake is one of three major watersheds in the GVRD, and it currently supplies forty percent of the region's drinking water. Water treatment facilities are located adjacent to the dam, and a tunneling project scheduled for completion in 2008 will connect the reservoir to a new treatment plant at the Seymour Dam to the east.
There is also the Capilano Fish  Hatchery in the park, about 500 metres downhill from the Cleveland Dam. Admission is free. The hatchery receives 238,000 visitors annually and is widely recognized for its contribution of coho and steelhead to the sport fishery in Burrard Inlet. The hatchery offers educational displays explaining the type of work that is done there, as well as basic education about the life cycles of the fish in the area. There is also a cross-section display of an active fish ladder. During spawning seasons, the fish ladder is heavily used by fish in the area that use it to bypass the dam.
The rugged waters of the Capilano River within the park also attracts kayakers and canoers. There are also a number of nature and biking trails in the park, and it is frequently used as a location for film and television production most notably MacGyver, Smallville, and Tin Man.


== Transportation ==
Street access is by way of Capilano Road in the District of North Vancouver. There are parking lots at the Cleveland Dam, near the top of Capilano Road, and at the fish hatchery along Capilano Park Road. TransLink bus routes 232 (from Phibbs Exchange), 236 (from Lonsdale Quay), and 246 (from downtown Vancouver or Park Royal in West Vancouver) stop near park and trail entrances. Hikers can access the park from several different trails in West Vancouver and the District of North Vancouver.

438,Vancouver South,"Vancouver South (French: Vancouver-Sud) is a federal electoral district in British Columbia, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1917 to 1997, and since 2004. It covers the southern portion of the city of Vancouver, British Columbia.


== Demographics ==

The riding is one of the most diverse in Canada. As of 2016, four ethnic groups form more than 10% of the riding; 37.9% Chinese, 21.8% European, 17.2% South Asian and 11.3% Filipino.
Vancouver South is the centre of the city's South Asian community; the colourful Punjabi market and the close-knit community of religious Sikhs dominate the area. The service sector, retail trade and manufacturing are the major sources of employment in Vancouver South. Nearly 30% of residents over the age of 25 years have obtained a university certificate or degree. The average family income is over $71,000. Unemployment is around 6.3%.


== History ==
This electoral district was formed in 1914 from Vancouver City riding.
In 1996, it was abolished and used to create Vancouver South—Burnaby with portions of New Westminster—Burnaby.
Vancouver South was re-created in 2003 when the Burnaby sections were moved into the new ridings Burnaby—Douglas and Burnaby—New Westminster.
The 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution concluded that the electoral boundaries of Vancouver South should be adjusted, and a modified electoral district of the same name will be contested in future elections. The redefined Vancouver South loses a portion of its current territory west of Cambie Street to the new district of Vancouver Granville, and gains a small area in the northeast currently included in Vancouver Kingsway. These new boundaries were legally defined in the 2013 representation order, which came into effect upon the call of the 42nd Canadian federal election, scheduled for October 2015.


=== Members of Parliament ===
This riding has elected the following Members of Parliament:


== Election results ==


=== Vancouver South, 2004–present ===
Its current representing MP is Harjit Sajjan, who is Minister of Defence in the current federal Cabinet. He has been its MP since the 2015 federal election, when he beat the Conservative then-incumbent by more than 6,000 votes.

439,Two Gilmore Place,"The District of North Vancouver is a district municipality in British Columbia, Canada, and is part of Metro Vancouver. It surrounds the City of North Vancouver on three sides. As of 2016, the District stands as the second wealthiest city in Canada, with neighbouring West Vancouver the richest. The municipality is largely characterized as being a relatively quiet, affluent suburban hub home to many middle and upper-middle-class families. Homes in the District generally range from mid-sized family bungalows to very large luxury houses.  A number of dense multi-family and mixed-use developments have popped up across the district in recent years; however, the District remains a primarily suburban municipality. The District is served by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, British Columbia Ambulance Service, and the District of North Vancouver Fire Department.


== History ==
For thousands of years, the Indigenous Squamish and their kin Tsleil-Waututh, of the Coast Salish, resided in the land known as North Vancouver. Slightly over 200 years ago, the people of the Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh living on the North Shore had their first glimpse of Europeans. First the Spanish arrived, giving their name to Vancouver's Spanish Banks and, in 1792, Captain George Vancouver explored the local shores. But it was not until 1862 that the first attempt was made to harvest the North Shore's rich stands of timber, leading to fuller settlement of the area that would later become North Vancouver.
The first industry on the North Shore was Pioneer Mills, founded in 1862 to log the huge trees of the coastal rainforest. After twice changing hands, the operation was bought by Sewell (""Sue"") Prescott Moody in 1865. Near where the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool grain elevators now stand, the town of Moodyville grew up and stood as the main centre of activity on the North Shore until the mill closed in 1901. The first school was established in Moodyville. The second, Central School, opened in 1902 in a building that still stands as part of what is now Presentation House at 3rd Street and Chesterfield Avenue, the current home of the North Vancouver Museum and Archives.
In 1891, the first municipality on the North Shore was formed as the District of North Vancouver. It stretched across the North Shore from Horseshoe Bay to Deep Cove but omitted Moodyville. In the early years of the 20th century, a real estate boom took place, with speculators – including the British poet Rudyard Kipling – eager to turn a quick dollar. A new community began to take shape. In 1902, the Hotel North Vancouver was built; in 1905, the first bank, a branch of the Bank of North America, opened. A newspaper, the Express, commenced publication in 1905 and in 1906 the British Columbia Electric Railway began streetcar service.
Industry, particularly shipbuilding, became central, with the nearby stands of trees a rich resource for a society in which ships, houses and most other manmade things were constructed mainly of wood. The Wallace Shipyards moved in 1906 to the area just east of Lonsdale Avenue, drawn by the arrival of electricity. Over the years, this company, later known as Burrard Dry Dock and then Versatile Pacific Shipyards, became a major force in the local economy. Many of the shipyard's buildings still stand although the company has now ceased operations.
Economic prosperity and rapid growth in the Lower Lonsdale area of North Vancouver led to the establishment in 1907 of the separate City of North Vancouver, with a population of approximately 1,500. West Vancouver separated from the District in 1912. Apart from the addition of Moodyville in 1915, the boundaries of the City have not changed, even though far more people now call the District home.
Communications with Vancouver have always been an important factor in the development of the North Shore. The first ferry service was supplied by ""Navvy Jack’s"" rowboat in 1866. In 1867, the Sea Foam established regular ferry service that continued until 1958. The SeaBus re-established water transportation in 1977. Rail service was slower in developing. While the Pacific Great Eastern Railway inaugurated a 12.7-mile run from North Vancouver to Whytecliff Park in 1914, it was not until the completion of the first Second Narrows Bridge in 1925 that rail and road links with the Lower Mainland supplemented the local ferry service.
Early plans for North Vancouver were ambitious. However, early grandiose plans met with a number of setbacks. The real estate boom was overtaken by a worldwide depression in 1913 and then World War I delayed many projects. The depression that began in 1929, coupled with disruptions to communications over the Second Narrows caused by ships colliding with the bridge, led to economic difficulties and severe tax shortfalls. Both the City and the District were placed in receivership in 1933. But the opening of the second road crossing, the Lions' Gate Bridge in 1938 was a significant factor in making the North Shore more accessible. And the war years led to an economic revival of North Vancouver, especially because of the many ships built in the Burrard Dry Dock at the foot of Lonsdale for the Canadian war effort.
In the postwar years, the City and the District of North Vancouver boomed, with most of the growth taking place in the District because of its greater land resources.


== Geography ==

The District of North Vancouver is separated from Vancouver by the Burrard Inlet. It can be accessed by the Lions' Gate Bridge, the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing, and the SeaBus passenger ferry.
The District is bounded by the Capilano River to the west, Indian Arm to the east, Burrard Inlet to the south, and the Coast Mountains to the north. It sprawls in an east-west direction across the mountain slopes, and is characterized by rugged terrain and steep and winding roadways. While there is no true urban core within the District, there are a number of separate commercial neighbourhood centres. These include (from west to east): Edgemont Village, Upper Lonsdale, Lynn Valley, Main Street, Parkgate, and Deep Cove.

The District has a lot in common with West Vancouver and the City of North Vancouver. Together these three municipalities are commonly referred to as the North Shore. Most of the residents of the District live in single-family dwellings. Except for a few more historical areas, much of the development of the District has occurred since the 1950s. The City of North Vancouver has considerably higher commercial and residential density.


=== Climate ===
North Vancouver has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate type Cfb). 


== Government and politics ==


== Industry ==
While industry was the engine that propelled North Vancouver for much of the twentieth century, this has now largely been replaced by enterprises more in tune with present economic realities. Many North Shore companies are in the business of creating and marketing high technology.
The television and film industry has made the area the centre of Hollywood North. Filming of the series The X-Files took place in North Vancouver for five seasons, with many of its ""wilderness"" sequences shot in the Lower Seymour Conservation Reserve (LSCR).


== Sites of interest ==

The Capilano Suspension Bridge in a private park carries hikers across the Capilano River to nature trails and a unique rain forest canopy walk (there is an admission fee).

Maplewood Flats Conservation Area is a conservation area known for its bird watching and easy to access trails
Maplewood Farm is an educational children's farm operated by the District of North Vancouver


== Transportation ==
The main (and only) highway through the District of North Vancouver is the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1). This crosses over the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing from Vancouver and goes through the District to the western border with West Vancouver.
Public transit, operated by Coast Mountain Bus Company and funded by TransLink, runs routes throughout the District, mostly from Lonsdale Quay in the City of North Vancouver. West Vancouver Blue Bus also runs several routes between the two North Vancouvers and West Vancouver.

440,North Shore (Greater Vancouver),"The North Shore (of Burrard Inlet) is a term commonly used to refer to several areas adjacent to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada:

the District of West Vancouver;
the City of North Vancouver;
the District of North Vancouver; and
the North Shore MountainsIt is renowned for its proximity to nature, varied outdoor recreation opportunities (especially mountain biking) as well as historically significant west coast modernist architecture.


== Activities ==
Attractions include three local ski hills - Cypress Mountain, Grouse Mountain, and Mount Seymour - which feature skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, tubing, and tobogganing. Hiking and watersports are also popular activities in the North Shore communities. Popular hiking areas include six mountain peaks - Black, Strachan, Hollyburn, Grouse, Fromme, and Seymour Mountains – along with the Grouse Grind, Lynn Canyon Park, Quarry Rock, Norvan Falls, Dog Mountain, and Cypress Mountain. Watersports such as canoeing, kayaking, and stand-up paddleboarding are popular in Deep Cove during the summer months. West Vancouver's Whytecliff Park is a popular location for scuba diving. The Harmony Arts Festival is a ten-day arts festival taking place in West Vancouver every summer, the Coho Festival is a celebration of environment protection and nature's annual miracle of salmon returning to North Shore rivers and streams held every September in Ambleside, West Vancouver, and the Shipyards Night Market is a summer market taking place from May to September with food, locally made products, and live music. The Polygon Gallery at Lonsdale Quay is a non-collecting Canadian public art gallery with a focus on photography and media-based art.


== Access ==
Access to these municipalities is limited by geography. Three major bodies of water (Howe Sound to the west, Burrard Inlet to the south, and Indian Arm to the east) and the rugged peaks of the Coast Mountains to the north isolate the North Shore from the rest of the Lower Mainland. Two road bridges (the Lions' Gate Bridge and Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing) connect to the city of Vancouver and the Trans-Canada Highway. The only other road access is by way of Highway 99 from the north or the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal from Vancouver Island and the Sunshine Coast. The SeaBus passenger ferry, part of the Lower Mainland's transit system, connects Lonsdale Quay with Vancouver in downtown Vancouver.

441,Canadian Women's Open,"The CP Women's Open is a women's professional golf tournament managed by Golf Canada. It has been Canada's national championship tournament since its founding in 1973, and is an official event on the LPGA Tour.


== History ==
Originally a three-round (54-hole) tournament for its first six years; it has been a four-round (72-hole) tournament since 1978. From 1979 through 2000, the event was one of the LPGA Tour's four major championships. In 2001, it was replaced in the LPGA's roster of majors by the Women's British Open, an existing event which was already a major on the Ladies European Tour.
In 2007 and 2008, it was the final ""winner"" event of the LPGA season—i.e., an event in which the winner earns an automatic berth in the LPGA season-ending championship, the LPGA Tour Championship. As of 2009, the LPGA no longer uses this system to determine players who qualify for the Tour Championship. From 2007 to 2009, the CWO was the third richest event on the LPGA Tour, behind only the U.S. Women's Open and the Evian Masters in France. The prize fund was reduced in 2010 and 2012, but the $2.25 million purse remains among the highest on the LPGA Tour.In 2012, amateur Lydia Ko became the youngest-ever winner of an LPGA Tour event. At 15 years and four months, she surpassed the record set by Lexi Thompson at 16 years and seven months in September 2011. Ko's win also made her only the fifth amateur to have won an LPGA Tour event, and the first in over 43 years. 
She successfully defended her win as an amateur in 2013, and won her third in 2015 as a professional.
In 2018 Brooke Henderson became the first Canadian in 45 years, and only the second ever after Jocelyne Bourassa won the inaugural event in 1973, to win Canada's national open.


== Title sponsorship ==
The tournament was first known as La Canadienne, as the event was held in Quebec. In 1974, it was sponsored by Imperial Tobacco Canada, becoming the Peter Jackson Classic until 1984, after which it became the du Maurier Classic;  both Peter Jackson and du Maurier are cigarettes within the Imperial Tobacco Canada umbrella. Imperial Tobacco Canada's sponsorship ended after 2000 because of Canadian tobacco restrictions.
From 1988 to 2000 both Classique du Maurier Ltée and du Maurier Ltd Classic were official because of Canada's Official Languages Act. In 1988, the tournament added the Ltd/Ltée designation because of the Tobacco Products Control Act. Under the rule, the full name of the manufacturer was required on promotional material as opposed to a tobacco brand name, so Imperial Tobacco registered their brands as separate corporate entities to avoid the ban.
In 2001, the Bank of Montréal took over sponsorship of the event for five years and renamed it the BMO Canadian Women's Open, or Omnium canadien féminin BMO.  It was the first year the tournament was officially called the Canadian Women's Open, a title that the Golf Canada now recognises for all past playings.
In 2006, the Canadian National Railway Company (CN) became the new title sponsor of the event and the championship was called the CN Canadian Women's Open, or Omnium canadien féminin CN.
In November 2013, Canadian Pacific Railway Company took over title sponsorship of the Canadian Women's Open and the event name was changed to Canadian Pacific Women's Open, or Omnium féminin Canadien Pacifique. Canadian Pacific also increased the purse to $2.25 million USD.

442,Shaughnessy Golf & Country Club,"Shaughnessy Golf & Country Club is a private golf club in Canada, located on Southwest Marine Drive in Vancouver, British Columbia.


== History ==
The Shaughnessy Heights Golf Course, today the Shaughnessy Golf and Country Club, had its beginning in 1911 in the office of CPR executive, Richard Marpole. Nine businessmen, all residents of the prestigious and quickly developing enclave of Shaughnessy, agreed to turn 67 acres (27 ha) of land leased from the CPR into the Shaughnessy Heights Golf Course. The first nine holes opened on November 2, 1912; the second nine, the next year. The course was designed by A.V. Macan, an Irish immigrant from Wexford, who was one of the region's best golfers.In the decades to follow, many of the names who played a prominent role in Vancouver's growth and prosperity also appeared on Shaughnessy's membership roster.The club moved to new premises in the late 1950s, responding to the growth of the Vancouver urban region, and sold its original property. Macan, then in his late 70s, also designed the new course, which opened in the early 1960s. The land the club currently resides upon belongs to the Musqueam Nation but was leased to Shaughnessy through a series of meetings with federal agents that did not include the Nation. The land will not be returned to the Musqueam until 2033.In 2011 the club hosted the Canadian Open for the fourth time, which coincides with Shaughnessy's 100th anniversary. It follows the 2011 British Open, which was held at Royal St George's Golf Club.The course was lengthened and renovated in the late 1990s. 
Shaughnessy Golf & Country Club has been long regarded as one of the top golf courses in Canada, currently ranking in the top 20 on Canada's list of best golf courses by Scoregolf magazine.


== Tournaments hosted ==

443,Gilmore station (SkyTrain),"Gilmore is an elevated station on the Millennium Line of Metro Vancouver's SkyTrain rapid transit system. The station is located on Gilmore Avenue in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.
The station is adjacent to several high-rise condominium complexes which are a component of the Brentwood Town Centre Development Plan, which drives the transformation of the area from a light industrial and lower-occupancy commercial zone into an urbanized centre.


== Structure and design ==
Gilmore station, completed in 2002 as part of the original Millennium Line, is elevated with two platforms on either side of the SkyTrain tracks. The station was designed by Busby and Associates who also designed Brentwood Town Centre station. Dominion Construction built the Gilmore station as part of a $14.3-million contract that also included Brentwood Town Centre station and the Gilmore power substation.As the station was expected to be incorporated into a new commercial complex, the wood and metal frames were designed to be easily disassembled and then reconfigured, maintaining the artistic intention of the station and accommodating any future alterations to the SkyTrain line or development around it.


== Station information ==


=== Station layout ===


=== Entrances ===
Gilmore station is served by a single entrance located at the southwest end of the station at the northeast corner of Gilmore Avenue and Dawson Street.

444,Sir Guy Carleton Elementary School,"Sir Guy Carleton Elementary School (commonly referred to as Carleton) is an elementary school located at the southern periphery of the Renfrew-Collingwood neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is part of School District 39 Vancouver.


== History ==
The school is located next to the intersection of Kingsway and Joyce Street and the original schoolhouse was central to the Collingwood community since its completion in 1896. It is ranked an ""A"" category heritage building in Vancouver's Heritage Register. Originally named the Vancouver East School, its name was changed to Collingwood Heights in 1908, and then to its present name in 1911. The school is named after Guy Carleton, the lieutenant-governor of Quebec during the late 18th century.


=== 2008 schoolhouse fire ===
At around midnight on March 2, 2008, the original schoolhouse was set ablaze by arsonists. The kindergarten classes that were taught in the schoolhouse had to be temporarily relocated due to the fire. After the fire, the Vancouver School Board (VSB) considered demolishing the charred building; however, the idea was met with heavy protest, and the idea was later scrapped.
In 2012, Green Thumb Theatre entered into a lease agreement with the VSB, restoring the two outbuildings. Construction was completed in early 2013, and one of the buildings became the administrative office for Green Thumb Theatre, while the other houses a theatre.


=== 2016 brick building fire ===
On August 19, 2016, at around 7:15 PM, a fire began on the third floor of the main brick building, which quickly spread and was subsequently upgraded to a four-alarm blaze. The flames reach the building's attic, where the fire was contained. The source of the fire remains unclear.  As of the 2016 fire, Carleton has remained vacant, although it is still under consideration by the VSB for future seismic upgrades.


=== Proposed closure ===
In June 2016, the VSB announced their intention to close down Carleton, along with Graham D. Bruce Elementary School and Gladstone Secondary School, due to the VSB's failure to cut operating costs. In October 2016, the VSB announced that they would suspend their plans for school closures ""indefinitely"".In February 2019, the VSB released a draft of their long-term facilities plan, which named twenty-eight schools, including Carleton, that the school board considered as possible future closures, due to low-enrollment numbers and/or a need for seismic upgrades.

== Company history ==
Originally named Rock Solid by founder Dave Lane, the company's first line of products was climbing gear. Dave Lane sold his 50% interest to Blair Murdoch and Tim Duholke who became silent partners in 1989.  Then-principal Jeremy Guard changed the company name to ""Arc'teryx"" in 1991 to reflect the company's vision of creating disruptive ""evolutionary"" innovation within the outdoor products industry. Using a heat laminate (thermolamination) technology, the partners designed and marketed the Vapor harness, which would become the company's most popular item. In 1993, after a series of relocations and staff additions, Arc'teryx released the Bora backpack using the same Vapor technology. In 1996, after obtaining a license from W. L. Gore & Associates for use of the GORE-TEX fabric, the company adapted it for its new line of outdoor technical apparel.Needing a larger manufacturing space, the company moved its headquarters to Burnaby, British Columbia, in 1999. In 2005, the Arc'teryx head office moved back across the Burrard Inlet to North Vancouver. Their products are usually associated with climbing, skiing, snowboarding, backpacking, and hiking-related activities.Guard was president and principal of the company from 1991 through 2001. In January 2001, Arc'teryx was purchased by the Adidas-owned Salomon Group. In May 2005, Amer Sports purchased the Salomon Group from Adidas. The Arc'teryx head office is still located in North Vancouver, although harnesses, backpacks, and much other laminated equipment is made in its own factory in New Westminster, BC.  Their apparel line has expanded, thus Arc'teryx has consequently outsourced to plants in China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Bangladesh, El Salvador, Laos, and Greece.

At the time, it brought innovation to the outdoor industry and was recognized as one of the most advanced alpine climbing shells on the market,  using GORE-TEX's breathable waterproof technology, WaterTight zippers and microseams with narrow seam tape for lightness. The Alpha SV has been updated incrementally over the years, remaining Arc'teryx's most recognized piece due to its reputation as one of the most durable and well-designed hardshells in the industry.

=== LEAF ===
The Arc'teryx LEAF (Law Enforcement and Armed Forces) product line is composed of equipment targeted to the military and law enforcement markets. Although some items are simply counterparts in design to their civilian models, other items, such as Arc'teryx's Tango and Charlie packs, are made in camouflage patterns and constructed to military specification, including numerous PALS-type attachment loops and fabric featuring neutral and camouflage coloring. Due to dissatisfaction with the MOLLE gear, the United States Marine Corps chose  Arc'teryx's Tango design for their new backpack, the ILBE.

=== Recommerce Program ===
Launched in 2019, Arc'teryx Used Gear is the official used gear trade program where customers can give back their garments in exchange for a refund in the shop. The company repairs and refurbishes used products and put them back on sale on a dedicated second-hand market place. This augments the life cycle of the products, allows new customers to access more affordable high-quality equipment and reduce their impact on the planet by not extracting new resources for manufacturing new apparel. This program is only available in the United States and Canada for now, with plans to expand to Europe. 


=== Arc'teryx Academies ===

Academies provide skill developments and education from Arc'teryx athletes and guides.


=== Arc'teryx Athletes ===
Arc’teryx Athletes program sponsors both grass roots and well-established professional athletes by offering personal and professional development. As members of the Arc'teryx family, athletes trust Arc'teryx gear to perform when they need it most. The athlete team refines products by testing prototypes, pushing their gear to the limits, and working directly with the design team on tweaks or improvements. 

The Bird's Nest Project, running since 2009, is organized by a group of Arc'teryx volunteers who have made and donated almost 4,000 GORE-TEX capes for homeless and community organizations in Vancouver, BCusing left over fabrics from manufacturing.In 2019 the company joined the Leave No Trace ethics.

447,Joyce–Collingwood station,"Joyce–Collingwood (formerly Joyce) is an elevated station on the Expo Line, a part of Metro Vancouver's SkyTrain rapid transit system. The station is located on Joyce Street at Vanness Avenue, in the Renfrew–Collingwood neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.


== History ==
The station was designed by the Austrian architecture firm Architektengruppe U-Bahn and opened in 1985 as ""Joyce station"" on the original Expo Line. It replaced Joyce Loop, located 600 metres (2,000 ft) south at the intersection of Joyce Street and Kingsway, as the main transfer point for local transit services in the area. Trolley wires were extended to the station in early 1986 to bring trolley buses to the station's bus loop.The station is located on the former right-of-way once used by the British Columbia Electric Railway's Central Park Line; this line ran from just west of Nanaimo station to where New Westminster station is located.
Formerly an industrial area, the immediate vicinity of this station has since been redeveloped as Collingwood Village, a denser community of high-rise condominiums. The ""Collingwood"" portion of the name was added in 2001 in an attempt to reflect the positive impact of SkyTrain on the surrounding community, as the station had been known to have a particularly negative community impact in terms of contributing to higher rates of crime and violence since its opening.As part of Expo Line upgrades, renovations on the station began in early 2016. Phase one of the project was completed on October 6, 2017; it included a replacement of the existing elevator, the installation of two new escalators to replace the original single one, and the improvement of the station design and integration with the surrounding community. Phase two renovations began in early 2018 and were completed on June 15, 2019.


== Services ==
The station connects to a number of TransLink bus routes serving eastern Vancouver, Burnaby, and North Vancouver.
It is one of the termini for the R4 41st Ave RapidBus service, which replaced the 43 express route that ran west from this station to the University of British Columbia on January 6, 2020.


== Station information ==

448,University Endowment Lands,"The University Endowment Lands (UEL) is an unincorporated area that lies to the west of the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and adjacent to the University of British Columbia and the lands associated with that campus.  Pacific Spirit Regional Park lies within the UEL. The UEL is part of Metro Vancouver. Mail sent to the UEL is addressed to ""Vancouver"" rather than the UEL.
The UEL is administered directly by the province and landowners pay their property taxes directly to the provincial government. In a 1995 referendum, UEL residents voted against establishing a municipal governing body.


== Geography ==
The University Endowment Lands are located immediately west of the City of Vancouver. Statistics Canada reports a total land area of 14.13 square kilometres (5.46 sq mi). About half of the UEL is made up of Pacific Spirit Regional Park, a mostly forested land that was originally set aside for development which never materialized. Located on Point Grey, the UEL also boasts tall cliffs near the water, with steep drops of approximately 70 metres (230 ft) down to the beaches below.
Because of its isolated location and the nature of the steep cliffs next to the beaches, Greater Vancouver's only nude beaches are located in the University Endowment Lands, the best known being Wreck Beach, located near the western tip of the peninsula.


== Climate ==

Because the UEL is close to seaside cliffs and the Strait of Georgia, above-average winds are common. Most of the winds come from the Strait itself, Howe Sound and English Bay.
Snowfalls are also more common than many parts of the City of Vancouver because of the area's higher altitude and the lack of an urban heat island due to less terrestrial development.
The UEL has higher humidity compared to other parts of Greater Vancouver because it is surrounded on three sides by water. Fog is common in the winter months, especially in areas near Pacific Spirit Park and the water.


== History ==
The territory was originally held by the Musqueam Indian Band which still lays claim to the area.
The creation of the University Endowment Lands was first proposed after the passing of the University Endowment Act of 1907, in which the British Columbia provincial government agreed to set aside two million acres (8,000 km2) of British Columbia Crown land to be sold or leased to fund the creation of a university. This land was to be in the Cariboo region of the province's Interior, and consisted of mostly agricultural land. This idea was changed in 1911 when the provincial government passed the University Site Act, which set aside 175 acres (71 ha) in Point Grey for the university. This is where the UEL is located today.

By 1920, it was realized that the Cariboo land did not have a high enough market value to generate the income needed for the university, so that idea was abandoned. This led to the British Columbia University Loan Act, which allowed the Lieutenant-Governor to sell 3,000 acres (12 km2) of Crown land on Point Grey for residential development. The money from the auction was put in the University Endowment Account for the university.However, a lot of the development that was planned was halted due to economic hardships stemming from the Great Depression. The university could not afford to prepare the land for development or to clear the forest land for development. In the 1930s, the university returned control of the land to the government. By the mid-1950s, over half of the undeveloped land in the UEL remained undeveloped due to the Depression and war shortages in the 1940s.
There have been many attempts to develop this land, which was then opposed by environmentally aware residents in the area. In 1988, the creation of Pacific Spirit Park was announced by the provincial Premier Bill Vander Zalm. The park currently makes up of over half of the UEL, acting as a greenbelt between the developed areas and the City of Vancouver. Development, in large part, is very limited; for any proposed developments in the UEL by the Greater Vancouver Regional District or the University of British Columbia, the following groups must be consulted beforehand: university students, university staff, university faculty, environmental groups, businesses, residents and the general public.


== Demographics ==

The University Endowment Lands' residential population is small and the non-university population includes mostly high-income professionals as the land there is very expensive. The other residents are mostly students living in the university's residences. The 2001 census reported an official permanent population of 7,816. The daytime university population is around 40,000 and includes undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty and staff. As with most universities, diverse cultural and ethnic groups make up the daytime university population, making the UEL very multicultural.


== Government and politics ==
An unincorporated entity, the UEL has no mayor or municipal government. Rather, it is mostly governed by the University of British Columbia, the Metro Vancouver Regional District (MVRD) and the Province of British Columbia, and they control three entities: the University of British Columbia, University Hill and Pacific Spirit Regional Park. It is part of Electoral Area A of the GVRD.
Residential and commercial taxes are paid directly to the provincial government.
UEL residents are eligible to vote only for school board trustees in City of Vancouver municipal elections.
For provincial elections, the UEL falls under the Vancouver-Point Grey electoral riding.  The current Member of the Legislative Assembly is David Eby.
For federal elections, the UEL is in the Vancouver Quadra electoral riding. The seat is held by Joyce Murray.


== Neighbourhoods ==
The UEL is made up of four neighbourhood areas:
Area A is bordered by Chancellor Boulevard, Acadia Road, University Boulevard and Wesbrook Mall.
Area B lies between Chancellor Boulevard and NW Marine Drive.
Area C is between Blanca Street, West 6th Avenue, Tasmania Crescent and College Highroad.
Area D is bordered by University Boulevard, Agronomy and Toronto Roads, Wesbrook Mall and includes Block F.


== Transportation ==
Pacific Spirit Regional Park, at the eastern end of the Endowment Lands, creates a physical buffer between the University and the adjacent Vancouver neighbourhoods of West Point Grey and Dunbar. Because of this, there are only five roads leading from Vancouver into the UEL: North West Marine Drive, 4th Avenue/Chancellor Boulevard, 10th Avenue/University Boulevard, 16th Avenue, and South West Marine Drive.
However, the large number of students and staff commuting to UBC on a daily basis means that the area is easily accessible by public transit. UBC Exchange is the western terminus of many TransLink bus routes, and the bus system is heavily used due to a discount bus pass system called U-Pass. The following routes service the UEL and UBC:

#4 – UBC/Downtown/Powell
#9 – UBC / Alma / Granville / Commercial–Broadway Station / Boundary (peak hours only, Monday to Friday, September to April)
#14 – UBC/Hastings
#25 – UBC / Brentwood Station
#33 – UBC / 29th Avenue Station
#R4 – UBC / Joyce Station (express)
#44 – UBC/Downtown (Monday to Friday, express)
#49 – UBC / Dunbar Loop / Metrotown Station
#68 – UBC / Wesbrook Village
#84 – UBC / VCC–Clark Station (express)
#99 B-Line – UBC / Commercial–Broadway Station (express)
#258 – UBC / West Vancouver (Monday to Friday, September to April, express)
#480 – UBC / Bridgeport Station (Monday to Friday, express)
#N17 – UBC/Downtown (NightBus)


== Economy ==
The UEL is largely a residential neighbourhood, and most economic activity is centred at the University of British Columbia and the area around University Village and University Marketplace. UBC's stores are located mostly in the Student Union Building (""the SUB""). The Village and Marketplace, located next to each other near the intersection of University Boulevard and Allison Road, are located off-campus and home to a food court, several restaurants, some shops, some medical clinics and some services.

The eastern end of the UEL is home to the University Golf Course, which is one of the original developments in the non-campus portions of the UEL.
Wreck Beach is also a popular area for locals and tourists alike due to its reputation as one of the largest clothing optional beaches in North America.  A thriving market in food, drink, clothing, personal services and various recreational substances has prospered on the beach for decades.


=== Commercial centres ===


==== University Village ====
The University Village is the first commercial structure built on the UEL. Its main level mostly includes a convenience store, a McDonald's restaurant, a photocopying store and a florist.
The second level is home to a Japanese restaurant, a salon, a pizza parlour and a discount textbook store (which is in direct competition with UBC Bookstore, located on campus).

The basement level is entirely dedicated to a multicultural-themed food court, including Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Middle Eastern, etc.


==== University Marketplace ====
The University Marketplace is a mixed commercial-residential structure completed around the late 1990s to the early 2000s. The main floor is home to Rogers Wireless, Staples Business Depot, Starbucks, several restaurants, some cafes and others.
The second floor of the Marketplace contains mostly offices and medical clinics. Some professors from UBC (especially those in the medical field) have offices located there, likely due to the proximity of the science buildings and UBC Hospital.
The upper floors of the Marketplace contain mostly residential apartment housing.


== Education ==

The UEL is adjacent to the University of British Columbia (hence the name ""University Endowment Lands""), the Vancouver School of Theology and Regent College. 
In addition, the UEL is served by the Vancouver School Board and is zoned to University Hill Secondary School and University Hill Elementary School.


== Emergency services and public safety ==
Police
Unlike neighbouring City of Vancouver, which is under the jurisdiction of Vancouver Police Department, the UEL is under the jurisdiction of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) University detachment because of its Provincial Crown Land status.
Fire and rescue
The UEL is served by the Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services under contract.
Ambulance
Ambulance service is provided by British Columbia Ambulance Service, as is the entire province.
Emergency social services
Organized and provided by the UBC Emergency Planning Office, Department of Health Safety and Environment.
Health care facilities
UBC Hospital Urgent Care Centre is the closest hospital. However, for serious symptoms like chest pain, abdominal pain, difficulty breathing or stroke, patients will be transferred to the Vancouver General Hospital.
If children or women require specialty services, they will be transferred to BC Children's Hospital or BC Women's Hospital & Health Centre.

449,Khalsa Diwan Society Vancouver,"The Khalsa Diwan Society Vancouver (Gurmukhi: ਖ਼ਾਲਸਾ ਦਿਵਾਨ ਸੋਸਾਇਟੀ ਵੈਨਕੂਵਰ Khālsā Divān Sosāiṭī Vainkūvar) is a Sikh society based at a gurdwara in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was the largest gurdwara in North America. A gurdwara (Punjabi: ਗੁਰਦੁਆਰਾ, gurdu'ārā or ਗੁਰਦਵਾਰਾ, gurdvārā), meaning ""the doorway to the Guru"", is the Sikh place of worship and may be referred to as a Sikh temple.
It is the oldest Sikh society in Greater Vancouver. The current gurdwara is at the intersection of Southwest Marine Drive and Ross Street, in South Vancouver.


== History ==
The Khalsa Diwan Society was founded on July 22, 1906 and was registered on March 13, 1909. The corporate name was ""The Khalsa Diwan Society"". Their first site and gurdwara was built in 1908 at 1866 West 2nd Avenue. It was inaugurated on January 19, 1908. The financial situation of the society depended on the number of Sikhs living in British Columbia. Donations rose considerably as more Sikhs came to British Columbia. The population of Sikhs rose in the period of 1904–1908, the population being 5,185. It fell to 2,342 in 1911. The Sikh population dwindled even more, to 1,099, as the year 1918 approached. Verne A. Dusenbery, the author of ""Canadian Ideology and Public Policy: The Impact on Vancouver Sikh Ethnic and Religious Adaptation,"" wrote that the gurdwara served as ""truly a religious, social, political, cultural, and social service center for the entire South-Asian immigrant population of the lower mainland"" during its early history.In the 1940s the KDS served in a leadership role as Indo-Canadians asked for voting rights, and it did so in a secular capacity. The KDS had a secular role as a community centre and also served Hindus and Muslims among the Indo-Canadians. Raj Hans Kumar, author of ""Gurdwara as a Cultural Site of Punjabi Community in British Columbia, 1905 – 1965,"" stated that in political affairs the KDS represented all ""Hindus"", which at the time meant all people of East Indian origin.In the early 1950s, a serious split occurred in the Canadian Sikh community, when the Khalsa Diwan Society elected a clean-shaven Sikh to serve on its management committee. Although most of the early Sikh immigrants to Canada were non-Khalsa, and a majority of the members of the society were clean-shaven non-Khalsa Sikhs, a faction objected to the election of a non-Khalsa to the management committee. The factions in Vancouver and Victoria broke away from the Khalsa Diwan Society, and established their own gurdwara society called Akali Singh. The Akali Singh Society opened in 1952.By the late 1950s there were plans to establish Punjabi language students for Canadian-born children and to collect funds for a new community centre. In 1963 the society began planning for a new gurdwara and community centre. The society decided to build a new gurdwara in 1969. The society purchased 2.75 acres (11,100 m2) of city land in 1968. Construction was completed in the first week of April 1970 for a price of $6,060. Sri Guru Granth Sahib was moved from the 2nd Avenue gurdwara to the Ross Street gurdwara on Vasakhi Day 1970. The initial plans asked for a library and community centre, but these aspects were eliminated from the plans. Construction happened from winter 1969, to April 1970. The celebration for Guru Nanak's 500th birthday was held prior to the grand opening in 1970. The building is intended to look like a lotus rising from water. To get inspiration for the style, the architect, Arthur Erickson, traveled to Agra and Amritsar.In 1979 the annual income of the KDS was $300,000. That year the leadership of the gurdwara changed. Previously the KDS was controlled by Marxist Sikhs who did not practice Sikhism. The membership had been around 5,000 prior to 1979, as there was a $12 membership fee. Membership increased after the elimination of the fee. According to Kamala Elizabeth Nayar, in 1984 the pro-Khalistan organization World Sikh Organization (WSO) began controlling the gurdwara. According to Hugh Johnston, Vancouver Sikhs stated that the political bloc that took charge of the KDS Gurdwara network by 1979 consisted of about 10-15 families.


== Vancouver Gurdwara ==
The original Vancouver gurdwara had a homeless shelter and a langar or kitchen. It served as a social centre for the community.


== Khalsa Diwan Road ==

As part of an initiative by Vancouver City Council to commemorate prominent members of the community, Ross Street was alternatively named Khalsa Diwan Road in 2018. Additional street signs marking it as Khalsa Diwan Road were added at from the Gurdwara at SW Marine Drive to 57th Avenue in 2019.


== Branches ==
In the 1960s, the main gurdwara was in Vancouver and the branch gurdwaras were in New Westminster, Abbotsford, Victoria, and Port Alberni. By 1973, the cities with KDS temples were Abbotsford, Mesachie Lake, New Westminster, Paldi, Port Alberni, and Vancouver. However the New Westminster Khalsa Diwan became its own Sikh society the following year. In 1975 the Khalsa Diwan Society of Abbotsford also separated, as the title of the Abbotsford gurdwara was transferred to the separated entity. The Abbotsford Sikhs wanted to have local control over their gurdwara, the Gur Sikh Temple.


== Events ==
Every March, a celebration of the martyrdom of Mewa Singh Lopoke is held. Sikhs from California go to the KDS to celebrate the event.


== First executive committee ==
The first executive committee of the Khalsa Diwan Society were members from 1907–1909. They included:

450,Capilano University,"Capilano University (CapU) is a teaching-focused public university based in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, nestled in a natural forested setting on the slopes of the North Shore Mountains, with programming that also serves the Sea-to-Sky Corridor and the Sunshine Coast (British Columbia). The University is named after Chief Joe Capilano Sa7plek (Sahp-luk) who was the leader of the Squamish people (Sḵwx̱wú7mesh) from 1895 to 1910.
In 2018, the University marked its 50th anniversary since opening in 1968 with a birthday message from the Prime Minister of Canada who remarked “CapU has empowered thousands of Canadians and people from around the world. Your alumni are artists of all kinds and educators and executives in every field. Above all, they’re leaders.”Capilano University's degree programs are approved by the Government of British Columbia’s Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. The degree-granting powers of the University are legislated by British Columbia's University Act. In 2012, CapU became Canada's first university to receive accreditation from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (or NWCCU) in Washington (state), one of six major regional agencies in the U.S. that are recognized by the United States Department of Education.Capilano University's sports teams, The Blues, have won 14 national titles in the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association, and 59 provincial titles in the Pacific Western Athletic Association.The University was originally founded as Capilano College by school boards and residents of the North Shore (Greater Vancouver) and Howe Sound in 1968 based on the need for a public institution serving the local communities immediately northwest of Vancouver. Initial enrollment was 784 students. In 2008, the province changed Capilano College's designation to a university and, as of 2019, it has grown to enroll approximately 12,700 students per year. Capilano University's academic offerings include nationally and internationally recognized liberal arts, professional, and career programs which lead to degrees, diplomas, and certificates.
The University's reputation rests on its smaller class sizes of 25-35 students which provide for more personalized teaching and learning. In 2018, conjointly with BC Stats (the provincial government's leader in statistical and economic research, information and analysis), the  BC Student Outcomes Research Forum (which represents the interests of British Columbia's Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training, and all of the participating post-secondary institutions) found that 97 per cent of bachelor's degree students at Capilano University were satisfied with their education, one of the top two ratings in the Province of British Columbia.In having aligned its program offerings with the BC Skills for Jobs Blueprint to ensure that students are career-ready for the most in-demand jobs when they graduate, CapU has a 96 per cent job placement rating amongst its graduates of bachelor's degree programs.


== History ==


=== Founding ===
The school boards of North and West Vancouver, Howe Sound and Sechelt formed a committee to determine the need for a community college to serve the region. The proposal to build a college on the North Shore passed by a plebiscite in North and West Vancouver and the Howe Sound in 1968. The provincial government granted approval, and Capilano College had its name selected from submissions made by North Shore residents, in honour of Chief Joe Capilano of the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh Coast Salish nation. Capilano College opened on September 10, 1968 with 784 students attending classes after hours at West Vancouver Secondary. The Capilano College Foundation was created in 1970 to provide scholarships and bursaries for students.In 1970, construction began on the North Vancouver campus in the Lynnmour area. Three years later, the permanent North Vancouver campus opened with 1,965 students in attendance. The first vocational programs were offered in portable buildings brought from West Vancouver Secondary. The first permanent structure at the North Vancouver campus, the original library building, also opened. In 1975 Capilano College opened the Squamish Learning Centre and Community Information Services at 38038 Cleveland Avenue in Squamish. In 1976, the Arbutus building opened at the North Vancouver campus and the Fir building opened in 1982. In 1991, the Cedar building, the Sportsplex, and Horticulture building were completed. Two years later, a new library replaced the former at the North Vancouver campus, tripling the size of existing library space. In 1996, the Birch building at the North Vancouver campus was completed, housing a performance theatre, classrooms, student services, and teaching space. The Child Care Centre also opened the same year.

=== Expansion ===
Capilano College offered its first bachelor degree, a collaborative degree in music therapy, with the British Columbia Open University in 1990 and added a second music degree in jazz studies in 1992. Business administration degrees were first offered in 1993. That year, Capilano College also conferred its first associate degrees, which are now available to students in a variety of subject areas from Interdisciplinary Arts, Creative Writing, English, Global Stewardship, Psychology, Interdisciplinary Sciences and Biology. The College was authorized by the provincial government in 2003 to become the first college in British Columbia to independently grant applied degrees after the dissolution of the B.C. Open University. In 2004, Capilano College was also named by the provincial government as host of the British Columbia Centre for Tourism Leadership and Innovation, in preparations for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The Centre addressed tourism issues, helped provide tourism education, and was part of the larger British Columbia Tourism and Hospitality Education and Training Consortium. In 2008, the centre was merged into Link BC, an education network for tourism and hospitality with industry organizations which resulted in partnerships with organizations and opportunities for students. In 2008, the provincial government changed Capilano College's designation to Capilano University.

The CSU is the resident student society of Capilano University and benefits the university and the community by advancing the interests of students. Like other student societies in British Columbia, the CSU's mandate is to advocate for students and provide services and events that improve the student experience. While the day-to-day management and operations are entrusted to a board of directors composed of elected students, governed by the constitution and bylaws of the society, students are ultimately in control of the activities of the CSU. The board of directors consists of five vice-presidents, seven liaisons representing special interest groups, two representatives for each faculty, four senate representatives, and two representatives to the university's board of governors. The CSU is registered under the Society Act of B.C. and receives funding from membership fees, collected from students by the university in accordance with the University Act.
The CSU provides services to its members, including a low-cost transit pass, free day planner, a used book sale, and health and dental benefits. Student interests are represented by the CSU, and the views of students are presented and advocated for in meetings with university administrators and representatives of local, provincial and federal governments. The student society also promotes the development of the campus community and improves the student experience by hosting events and supporting the development of student clubs and associations.

451,"The Ismaili Centre, Burnaby","The Ismaili Centre, Burnaby is one of six such centres worldwide. It was the first purpose-built Ismaili jamatkhana and the first Ismaili centre in North America. It has accordingly been the subject of sustained, dedicated academic analysis, being noted as a case-study of modern Islamic architecture in the West.


== Foundation ==
'The site in Burnaby was acquired in 1979, for it was here that the first Ismaili congregation was established in Canada.' The foundation ceremony for the new building was held on 26 July 1982, and construction was completed in 1985, during the silver jubilee of Aga Khan IV; the new building was opened by the former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. The building was conceived as an 'ambassadorial building' aiming to give visual architectural expression to the expanding Ismaili community in Canada, and designed 'not just for the use of the members of the Ismaili community, but [...] to become part of the fabric of the civil life of the area'.


== Architecture ==
Designed by the Vancouver architect Bruno Freschi, the Centre has been described as 'monumental', 'spectacular' and 'sitting harmoniously' within its environment, reflecting 'traditional Islamic architectural vocabulary in modern context, materials, and craftsmanship'. Its footprint is 3,870 square metres (41,600 square feet), with a basement containing offices and classroom space, and two upper floors, a double-height prayer-hall (reserved for Ismaili worship) and a multi-purpose hall, around a courtyard with a fountain. The prayer-hall is roofed with a series of shallow Turkish-style domes. The design 'attracted international plaudits'.


== Practice ==
Jamatkhana (sometimes simply khana) is a sacred place for Ismaili Muslims to pray and to learn. After the praying has finished they have a socializing period. During that period of time they sometimes have refreshments and food.

452,Killarney Secondary School,"Killarney Secondary School is a public secondary school in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is the largest public secondary school in the city by area. The school and the neighbourhood it is located in is named after Killarney, Ireland.


== History ==

Killarney Secondary School opened on September 29, 1957, beginning with students from Grades 7–10 and one wing (A-Wing). The teaching staff consisted of 52 members under the direction of principal Tom Alsbury. Grade 11 was added the following year, and Grade 12 the year after that, with the first class of senior students graduating as the class of 1960.
At the time of its opening, the school was surrounded by vacant land as the areas to the east and south were just beginning to see development. Killarney continued to grow especially as the area south of 49th Avenue matured.  November 1961 saw the addition of a new wing to the building which included an auditorium and stage (B-Wing). Just over six years later in December 1967, D-Wing was completed, which greatly expanded and improved the existing science and industrial education facilities. In the 1970s, seven portable classrooms were placed on the grounds to accommodate over 1,700 students enrolled by that time (construction of a neighbouring secondary school had been delayed). Within a decade, enrollment reached 2,000 and has remained around this number since. The most recent addition was C-Wing, with a new entrance, a foyer, 21 new classrooms, a new band-room, and a state of the art music lab.


== Current ==
Killarney Secondary is the largest secondary school in Vancouver by area, and a comprehensive school currently with around 2,000 students in Grades 8–12 with 167 teaching and non-teaching staff. Extra-curricular activities are abundant, with more than 35 clubs and a full inter-high school sports program. Killarney Secondary also has one of the highest enrollments in the district in the senior maths and sciences.


=== Fine Arts ===
Killarney has Vancouver's largest and most varied Fine Arts Program, featuring an internationally recognized music program in band, choral and strings, and award-winning programs in art/graphics and drama. The Killarney Secondary Band, Choir and Strings programs have performed worldwide.
KAFT, the Killarney Association for Film and Theater, was established September 2012, with the purpose of promoting the dramatic arts to the students in Killarney Secondary.


=== Achievements ===
The University of British Columbia Mathematics Department has been releasing a specific annual study of B.C. secondary schools since at least 1987.  It is a school-by-school study based on final standings in each December for the various UBC First Year Calculus Courses for students who graduated from secondary schools in British Columbia. Killarney Secondary School ranked in the top third for 13 consecutive years from 1991 to 2003, dropped down the list to 12th (of 21 schools) in 2004, and returned to the top third (5th out of 23 schools) in 2005.

455,Burnaby Hospital,"Burnaby Hospital, (formerly known as Burnaby General Hospital) is a healthcare facility located in Burnaby, British Columbia and operated by the Fraser Health Authority (FHA). One of the largest hospitals outside the City of Vancouver, it serves the communities of Burnaby and East Vancouver. A 314-bed primary and secondary care centre, patient care services include general surgery, orthopedic surgery, medicine, perinatal, neonatal ICU, critical care and emergency services.


== Overview ==
Burnaby Hospital is a university-affiliated hospital with the University of British Columbia, and serves as a training facility for the Family Practice Residency Program, the Pharmacy Practice Residency Program, and the Department of Orthopaedics at UBC.The Burnaby Hospital Foundation is the philanthropic arm of Burnaby Hospital. The foundation was established in 1982 to raise financial resources needed for life saving diagnostic, surgical, and medical equipment, innovative tools for patient care, and other community healthcare needs.  It uses a donor-centred approach, along with its annual fundraising events, the Rhythm of Life Run and Walk and the Slice, to achieve its objectives.


== History ==
In the 1940s, the citizens of Burnaby had a vision of a community hospital to serve the needs of its growing population. An Auxiliary was formed March 17, 1943, inspired by the dedication of Nurse Essex. They named it the ""Nurse Essex Auxiliary"". Later, in the early '40s, the South Burnaby Auxiliary was formed and these two Auxiliaries, plus twenty five other organizations joined together to build a community hospital in Burnaby.
At the opening of the 125-bed hospital on October 30, 1952, the need for funding grew, and in 1964, a main floor gift shop was opened. In 1968 the two auxiliaries combined into one 222-member organization known as the Ladies Auxiliary to Burnaby Hospital. In 1973, the 147-bed extended care wing was opened and in 1977 the acute care tower. The Atchison wing was officially opened with a potential of 497 acute care beds. Fund raising efforts were expanded as the Thrift shop was opened in 1975. In 1980, the Auxiliary to Burnaby Hospital became incorporated under the Society Act of B.C. and was officially named the Auxiliary to Burnaby Hospital, paving the way for future male membership. The auxiliary also provides approximately 20,000 hours of volunteer service every year.Burnaby Hospital has since grown into a 314-bed hospital that now services the health care needs of two distinct populations located within the Greater Vancouver Regional District. Burnaby with an estimated population of 247,337 and its neighbour, East Vancouver, with a population of 220,490.In September 2019, the Government of British Columbia alongside Fraser Health announced that the hospital will undergo a $1.3 billion redevelopment set to be complete in two phases between 2023 and 2027.


== Facilities ==
Burnaby Hospital offers a full range of facilities including a 24-hour emergency department, neurology, oncology, critical care (ICU, Cardiology, ER), obstetrics, pediatrics, surgery, tertiary palliative care, mental health and addictions and maternity services. The Emergency Department sees approximately 85,000 patients annually.  It includes specialized units such as the Multiple Sclerosis and Chronic Pain Clinics, and the speech and language pathology programme. The hospital also offers health and nutritional counselling, as well as physiotherapy and mental health programs.Distribution services include a computerized system to provide centralized, traditional drug distribution to the acute care and long term care areas; total parenteral nutrition, chemotherapy and a full CIVA service.

459,Burrard Peninsula,"The Burrard Peninsula (Squamish: Ulksen) is a peninsula in the Lower Mainland region of southwestern British Columbia, Canada, lying between Burrard Inlet to the north and the Fraser River to the south, and bounded by Georgia Strait on the west and the Pitt River on the east.  The City of Vancouver occupies most of the western half of the peninsula.
The Squamish name for the Burrard Peninsula as a whole—or rather, for the long rise of land from Point Grey to Central Park, was Ulksen or Ulxen. The name Burrard Peninsula is rarely used in casual reference to the area among locals in favour of a specific community or neighbourhood therein.


== Extent ==
There is no clear consensus on where the peninsula ends, as the Burrard Peninsula does not appear in official government gazetteers (directories of geographical features) and does not exist as a legal entity, and so has no legal definition. The peninsula is, however, attached to the mainland at its northeastern end, and as a matter of convenience, the isthmus may be taken to follow the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) across the relatively narrow, low neck of land from Port Moody at the eastern end of Burrard Inlet, through Coquitlam and Port Coquitlam southeast to the Pitt River. From where the CPR tracks cross the Pitt River, the Burrard Peninsula runs due west for approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) to Point Grey, a prominence protruding into Georgia Strait. The peninsula is approximately 6 to 8 kilometres (4 to 5 miles) wide for much of its length.


== Municipalities ==
Municipalities on the peninsula include—in roughly west-to-east order—the Cities of Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, Port Moody, Coquitlam, and Port Coquitlam. The University Endowment Lands (home to the main campus of the University of British Columbia) occupy unincorporated territory at the far west end of the peninsula, at Point Grey. North of the isthmus separating the peninsula from the mainland are the Villages of Belcarra and Anmore which are not on the peninsula proper, but are only accessible by road via the Burrard Peninsula.


== Landforms ==
The Burrard Peninsula consists for the most part of a hilly plateau, reaching a maximum height in most places of between 100 and 150 metres (300 and 500 feet) above sea level.  The plateau is bisected by a low trench running northwest to southeast, consisting of (running from west to east):

False Creek, separating the peninsula proper from Downtown Vancouver, which sits on a peninsular offshoot occasionally referred to as ""Coal Peninsula"";
the Canadian National Railway (CN) and Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railway yards, which sit on reclaimed land at the east end of False Creek;
the Grandview Cut, a trench that accommodates CNR/BNSF and SkyTrain tracks;
Still Creek, which drains into Burnaby Lake;
Burnaby Lake, which drains into the Brunette River; and
the Brunette River, which is the last tributary of any significant size of the Fraser River, joining the Fraser at New Westminster.Punctuating the plateau are several prominences of land including Little Mountain (a dormant volcano, approximately 170 metres above sea level) in Vancouver, and Capitol Hill (approximately 220 metres) and Burnaby Mountain (home to the main campus of Simon Fraser University; approximately 380 metres) in Burnaby. The plateau is flanked at its eastern end by the Coquitlam River, which flows south from Coquitlam Lake on the mainland into the Fraser River, its mouth lying upstream from the Brunette River. The land east of the Coquitlam River is largely flat and lying close to sea level, except for the stand-alone rise of Mary Hill in Port Coquitlam (approximately 70 metres).


== Land use ==
The Burrard Peninsula has been extensively urbanized, and includes the largest and densest populations in the Metro Vancouver region, and in British Columbia more generally.
While originally extensively forested, since the mid-19th century the Burrard Peninsula has gradually become essentially one large cityscape. Its largest remaining green spaces include Pacific Spirit Regional Park in Point Grey, Stanley Park in Downtown Vancouver, the areas around Burnaby Mountain, Central Park, Burnaby Lake, and Deer Lake in Burnaby, and Mundy Park and the Coquitlam River in Coquitlam.

== History ==
In the fall of 2014, Argyle succumbed to a small flood due to heavy rainfall overnight. The flash flood, 100 millimeters in 24 hours, caused families to evacuate their homes. They traced the source back to a plug in one of the many creeks in the area, which then found another path to flow down which turned out to be Kilmer (where flooding was the worst) and then Fromme. The extent of the damage on the school was the inundation of nine classrooms and the drama department's prop room. The following morning school was canceled as professionals and families alike attempted to reduce the damage to the school.Argyle Secondary School was built in 1960, and has undergone renovations in 1966, 1969, and 2000. In June 2016 it was confirmed that the school would receive $47.5 million for seismic upgrades, $37.6 million from the province and $8.1 million from the school district. The construction was set to start in 2017 so that it may be finished in the fall of 2019 for the predicted 1200 students from grade 8-12.

== History ==
The 1920s Lynn Valley Elementary School building, at 3203 Institute Road (now the Community History Centre) has been called ""the District of North Vancouver’s finest historic public building"" by the North Vancouver Office of Culture and Arts. The ""Edwardian Baroque""-style building was designed by local architects Henry Blackadder & Alexander Sinclair Wemyss MacKay.Educator and author John Goodlad, a student-teacher at the school in the 1940s, wrote that it was ""a joy"" to work there. Edwin Cohan, the teacher with whom Goodlad was assigned to work, and Stanley Morrison, the principal, ""almost raucous in their bantering of one another"", Goodlad wrote. They ""set a tone of caring and civility that permeated the whole school, affecting adults and children alike. Parents came and went as I had not seen before, knowing that they were welcome and would be listened to.""In 2004, the school celebrated its 100th birthday. A new school building was constructed for $4.6 million (Canadian) and ready by December 2004. In the following two years, the school experienced a large turnover of employees, with new administrators, teachers, office staff and special education aides.In May 2006, the Community History Centre opened in the former Lynn Elementary School building at 3203 Institute Road (northwest corner of Mountain Highway and Lynn Valley Road). The centre houses the local cultural commission offices, archives reading room, collections, storage, education resource centre and a public meeting room. By March 2006, before most school libraries in the district, Lynn Valley Elementary's school library had replaced its card catalog with computer searching, and checkout functions were also computerized.A Student Council was established in the fall of 2005.

462,Cleveland Dam,"The Cleveland Dam is a 91-metre high (299 ft) concrete dam at the head of the Capilano River in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada that holds back Capilano Lake, also known as Capilano reservoir. Part of the Capilano River Regional Park, it is not used for generating hydroelectricity, but rather for storing a portion of the Lower Mainland's drinking water. Construction was started in 1951 and completed in 1954.
The dam is named after engineer Ernest Albert Cleveland who envisioned the need for the proper maintenance of a pristine and efficient water supply as well as sustainable use of water resources. He served as the first chief commissioner of the Greater Vancouver Water District from 1926 until his death in 1952.


== Accidents ==
The Cleveland Dam had several failures of the drum gate, causing water to be uncontrollably released to Capilano River running through Capilano River Regional Park. Unlike the BC Hydro dams in British Columbia, Cleveland Dam operated by Greater Vancouver Regional District (current Metro Vancouver) does not have a warning alarm system, although the dam is inside a popular park close to a built-up area.In 1975, a nine-year-old girl was killed by a surge of water released from the dam. The area had no warning signs or alarm at the time. Signs were later added to warn visitors of the potential hazards of the dam.In 2001, four fishermen were trapped in the river when the water level surged without a warning after the spillway's drum gate inadvertently dropped open. WorkSafeBC issued several orders to reduce the risk to workers and the public, including but not limited to: ""spillway gate lockout, access to the riverway by workers where lockout is not required, mancheck systems, emergency rescue and evacuation, public warning signage, and warning alarms"". However, some of the orders were ignored and public-facing warning alarms were never installed.On October 1, 2020, the dam's drum gate opened unexpectedly during maintenance, causing water to gush out onto Capilano River. The torrent of water killed one person and trapped several park goers within Capilano River Regional Park. While many managed to escape by themselves, four people had to be rescued and at least one person is still missing. The Capilano River's water level rapidly increased by 3.58 metres (11.7 ft), pushing 413 cubic metres (109,000 US gal) of water per second at its recorded peak. These flow rates normally only occur in the rain season.
The anglers at the river edge had no warning except the sound of rushing water as the dam has no public alarm system to warn of a water surge. The popular recreation site had many people scrambling to get out of the way while others in safe areas witnessed their rush to escape.


== In popular culture ==
The dam is prominently featured in the Smallville episode ""Leech,"" where Clark Kent loses his powers via a lightning strike while attempting to save a classmate from jumping from the dam, as well as in the episode ""Dichotic"" in the second season. It is also featured in the second-season episode of the series Supernatural, titled ""Simon Said"". A Cadillac goes over the dam into the Capilano River in the film The 6th Day. The dam is also a central location in the film Bad Girls from Valley High. The dam and reservoir were also used in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The Amazon TV series The Man in the High Castle features the dam in several scenes during the first season of the show as a meeting location near Canon City, within the neutral zone.

463,Brentwood Town Centre station,"Brentwood Town Centre (sometimes abbreviated as Brentwood) is an elevated station on the Millennium Line of Metro Vancouver's SkyTrain rapid transit system. The station is located above Lougheed Highway east of Willingdon Avenue in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. The station is adjacent to the Brentwood Town Centre mall, a mid-size shopping centre.


== Structure and design ==
Brentwood Town Centre station is the only station in the system that is built on a median, with the entire station footprint located directly above a roadway. The station is also designed to serve as a pedestrian overpass across Lougheed Highway, which required the station platforms to be high above the roadway and a publicly accessible mezzanine/concourse to be built below the platform level. Only two other Millennium Line stations have this feature, Gilmore and Lougheed Town Centre stations.
The station is built using a combination of wood and steel, custom-designed to provide a curved appearance. The extensive use of glass for the outer wall makes the station glow at night.
On May 11, 2002, Perkins and Will Canada, designers of the station, were honoured for their work with a Governor General's Medal in Architecture.


== Station information ==

465,Great Marpole Midden,"The Great Marpole Midden (also known as the Eburne Site, or Great Fraser Midden, and known in Halkomelem as c̓əsnaʔəm), is an ancient Musqueam village and burial site located in the Marpole neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia.


== History ==
The site was inhabited by Coast Salish people beginning at least 4,000 years ago, until about 200 years ago, with the arrival of smallpox on the Northwest Coast. During that time it was a village known as c̓əsnaʔəm. According to BC Heritage Industry Canada site, the Marpole Culture Type dates between 2400 BP and 1600 years BP.In 1884 the midden was unearthed during the upgrading of Garypie Farm Road, and was the site of archaeological excavation throughout the subsequent decades. In 1892, Charles Hill-Tout did extensive excavations at the site for the Art, Historical, and Scientific Association of Vancouver, stimulating study of other middens in the region.  American Museum of Natural History archaeologist, Harlan Ingersoll Smith, participating in the Jesup North Pacific Expedition from 1897 to 1899, mined the Marpole site for skeletal remains.  In the 1950s and 1960s UBC professor Charles Edward Borden undertook salvage archaeology projects at the site. Borden ""was the first to draw links between contemporary Musqueam peoples and excavated remains.""The construction of the Fraser Arms Hotel in the 1950s destroyed much of the site.On May 25, 1933, the Marpole Midden was recognized as a National Historic Site of Canada, although the historic marker is located in nearby Marpole Park, while the midden itself is located a few blocks away, between Montcalm and Milton streets, south of Marine Drive.


== Condo development controversy and protests ==
In December 2011, a development permit was issued for the construction of a 108-unit condominium project. Intact remains were found in January 2012 during an archaeological dig as required by the permit.  In March 2012, members disrupted planned digging, claiming there was no consultation prior to the permit being issued in December, and in protest over the continued lack of dialogue.There was a cooling-off period while waiting for negotiations to occur, but protesters returned to the site because, in their opinion, there had been no meaningful progress. Musqueam Band members and the supporters of the Musqueam band staged a series of protests to raise awareness about the site in May 2012. These included a rally at Mountain View Cemetery on May 29, and a blockade of the Arthur Laing Bridge between Richmond and Vancouver on May 31.On September 27, 2012 Musqueam received the Province of B.C.’s decision regarding the permits issued by the Province under the Heritage Conservation Act to permit a 5 story condominium development at c̓əsnaʔəm, also known as the Musqueam Marpole Village Site. As recognized in the decision, this site was declared to be a National Historic Site in 1933 as one of the largest pre-contact middens in Western Canada and has special significance for Musqueam.
Musqueam is pleased that the proposed development is no longer authorized by the permits issued by the Province and that the ancestral remains are to be restored to their original condition. Their disturbance caused great anguish to the community and the proposed development would have desecrated an ancient and sacred burial place and destroyed a site precious to the Musqueam as representing one of the few links to our heritage extending back thousands of years. It would also have destroyed a Canadian historic site and a heritage site that should be protected for all British Columbians.Musqueam looks forward to being actively involved in the steps to be taken to restore the ancestral remains in accordance with Musqueam customs and beliefs, steps that must be taken immediately to prevent further deterioration.The Musqueam people have purchased the property.

466,TRIUMF,"TRIUMF is Canada's national particle accelerator centre. It is considered Canada's premier physics laboratory, and is consistently regarded as one of the leading subatomic physics research centers on the international level. Owned and operated by a consortium of universities as a joint venture, TRIUMF is located on the south campus of one of its founding members – the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia. TRIUMF houses the world's largest cyclotron, a source of 520 MeV protons, which was named an IEEE Milestone in 2010. TRIUMF's accelerator-focused activities involve particle physics, nuclear physics, nuclear medicine, materials science, and detector and accelerator development.
There are over 500 scientists, engineers, technicians, tradespeople, administrative staff, postdoctoral fellows, and students on the TRIUMF site. The lab attracts over 1000 national and international researchers every year and has generated over $1 billion in economic impact activity over the last decade.
TRIUMF scientists and university-based physicists develop and implement Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council's (NSERC) long-range plan for subatomic physics.  TRIUMF uses these plans to develop its own priorities.  TRIUMF has over 50 international agreements for collaborative scientific research.Asteroid 14959 TRIUMF is named in honour of the laboratory.


== History ==
TRIUMF was founded in 1968 by Simon Fraser University, the University of British Columbia, and the University of Victoria in order to meet research needs that no single university could provide. The original acronym, stemming from the name TRI University Meson Facility, was dropped and is no longer used to reflect TRIUMF's current state as a consortium of 19 universities. TRIUMF currently has 19 member and associate universities from across Canada.

Since its inception as a local university facility, TRIUMF has evolved into a national laboratory while still maintaining strong ties to the research programs of Canadian universities. The science program has expanded from nuclear physics to include particle physics, molecular and materials science, nuclear medicine, and accelerator research and development.
TRIUMF's 520 MeV cyclotron was officially commissioned on February 9, 1976 by Pierre Trudeau, the 15th Prime Minister of Canada. At the commissioning ceremony, he said ""I don't really know what a cyclotron is, but I am certainly very happy Canada has one.""Before the Riken SRC (superconducting ring cyclotron) was built, TRIUMF was the world's largest cyclotron in terms of weight and beam or magnetic field radius.  The Riken SRC is now heavier than the TRIUMF cyclotron, but TRIUMF has the largest beam radius and the largest vacuum tank. The Riken magnetic field covers from 3.5 m to 5.5 m radius with the maximum beam radius of about 5 metres (200 in). The TRIUMF field goes from 0 to about 320 inches radius with the maximum beam radius of 310 inches. This is because it requires a lower magnetic field to reduce EM stripping.

== Canadian University Partners ==
TRIUMF is owned and operated as a joint venture by a consortium of 21 universities, including 14 full and 7 associate members. The member universities consist of the University of Alberta, the University of British Columbia, Carleton University, University of Guelph, University of Manitoba, Université de Montréal, Simon Fraser University, Queen's University, University of Toronto, University of Victoria, University of Waterloo and York University.  The associate universities consist of the University of Calgary, McMaster University, University of Northern British Columbia, University of Regina, McGill University, Saint Mary's University, Université de Sherbrooke, the University of Winnipeg, and Western University.


== Organizational structure ==
The facility is organized into four divisions that focus on varying aspects of research and operations.


=== Accelerator Division ===
The Accelerator Division has operational, maintenance, and required upgrade responsibility for all of the 520 MeV Cyclotron, ISAC, and TR-13 facilities. The division also has responsibility for the design, construction, and commissioning of future accelerators on-site, and it provides support for external accelerator projects.


=== Engineering Division ===
The Engineering Division has general responsibilities for the engineering, design and fabrication of mechanical, structural and electronic components.  The division also has responsibility for electrical and mechanical services and site maintenance.


=== Physical Sciences Division ===
The Physical Sciences Division is responsible for scheduling experiments approved by the Experimental Evaluation Committee (EEC).  The division is also responsibility for the design, installation, operation and maintenance of components, systems and subsystems for all experimental operations at the TRIUMF site.  Lastly, it is also responsible for the coordination of infrastructure support for external programs.


=== Life Sciences Division ===
The Life Sciences Division is responsible for the support of projects approved by the Life Science Projects Evaluation Committee (LSPEC) and provides support for collaborations with the Pacific Parkinson's Research Centre (PPRC), BC Cancer Agency (BCCA), Nordion and other university faculties relying on radio-tracers from TRIUMF for their research.  This division is also responsible for the design, installation, operation and maintenance of components, systems and subsystems for the radioisotope production and processing facilities for tracers to be used in research projects both at TRIUMF and at other laboratories. TRIUMF's nuclear medicine department is part of this division.


=== Office of the Director ===
The Director, supported by the Deputy Directors of Research and Operations, has general oversight responsibilities for the following administrative departments: accounting and finance; environmental health and safety; general administration and security; human resources; procurement; quality assurance; strategic planning; communications and outreach; and supply chain management.  Additional oversight is given to the Applied Technology Group consisting of several work teams including Isotope Production, Cyclotron Operations, and Technical Support.  This group focuses on the production of radioactive isotopes for use by the medical isotope division of BWX Technologies, formerly Nordion, ultimately deployed in the development of drugs and diagnosis and treatment of disease.


=== TRIUMF Innovations ===
TRIUMF Innovations is the commercialization arm of TRIUMF, linking the laboratories activities with tangible business and commercialization opportunies. TRIUMF Innovations was established in 2017, replacing Advanced Applied Physics Solutions, Inc. (AAPS), TRIUMF's previous commercialization entity.


== Experiments ==
TRIUMF selectively applies its expertise to other areas of research and to the generation of entrepreneurial opportunities. Thus, the core program of nuclear, particle, and accelerator physics has expanded to cover key niche areas in life sciences and molecular and materials science.


=== Main cyclotron and proton beam lines ===
At the heart of TRIUMF is the 500 MeV cyclotron that produces the primary proton beams. A large fraction of the TRIUMF program relies on these beams, including the ISAC, the Centre for Molecular and Materials Science programs in μSR and β-NMR, and the Proton Treatment Facility. The operation of the main cyclotron has enabled TRIUMF to acquire the expertise to operate the three medical cyclotrons for Nordion and the TR-13 medical cyclotron used to produce medical isotopes, and assist companies to exploit commercial opportunities for the sale of cyclotron and other accelerator technologies.


==== The 520 MeV cyclotron ====
TRIUMF produces negatively charged hydrogen ions (H⁻: 1 proton, 2 electrons) from an ion source. The ions are transported through an evacuated electrostatic beam line containing elements to focus and steer the beam over 60m to the cyclotron. The 520 MeV (million electron volts) variable energy cyclotron accelerates these ions with a high frequency alternating electric field and uses a massive six-sector magnet to confine the beam in an outward spiral trajectory. Inserting a very thin graphite extraction foil strips, or removes, the electrons from the H⁻ ion while allowing the proton to pass through. The proton, because it is a positively charged particle, is deflected in the outward direction due to the magnetic field and is directed to a proton beam line.
The accelerating process takes approximately 0.3 ms before the proton achieves three-quarters the speed of light. The success of TRIUMF's programs depends on the ability to deliver protons from the cyclotron reliably. Typically, the cyclotron, although over 35 years old, averages an up-time of greater than 90% (2000–2007), with the 15-year average just under 90%. Typically the beam is delivered for about 5,000 hours per year with one major (three month) and one minor (one month) maintenance periods. The cyclotron beam properties and capabilities have improved over the years as a result of systems upgrades and the fundamental infrastructure providing the magnetic and electrical fields and the RF resonators as well as the vacuum vessel will serve TRIUMF for many more years.


==== The Four Proton Beamlines ====
TRIUMF has four independent extraction probes with various sizes of foils to provide protons simultaneously to up to four beam lines. Because of the high energy of the proton beam, these beamlines use magnetic rather than electrostatic focusing and steering elements.

Beamline 1A (BL1A)
can deliver 180 to 500 MeV protons to two target systems. The beam power ranges from 50 to 75 kW. The first target, T1, services three experimental channels. The second target, T2, services two μSR experimental channels. Downstream of T2 is a 500 MeV facility used to produce strontium isotopes for medical-imaging generators as well as the Thermal Neutron Facility (TNF).Beamline 1B
separates off BL1 at the edge of the cyclotron vault and provides international users with the Proton Irradiation Facility (PIF) that is used for radiation testing of electronic circuits, for example, mimicking space radiation for testing computer chips.Beamline 2A (BL2A)
capable of providing 475 to 500 MeV proton beams at up to 50 kW to the ISAC target facility that produces rare-isotope ion beams for a host of Canadian and international experiments.Beamline 2C (BL2C)
used for the Proton Therapy Program to treat choroidal melanomas (eye tumours) and proton irradiation to produce strontium isotopes, which are chemically processed and then used for medical imaging generators. This beam line also has the flexibility to provide protons of lower energy for PIF users. The energy range for this line is 70 to 120 MeV.Beamline 4 North (BL4N)
(expected completion 2017), will be a new 500 MeV beamline used for the proposed expansion of ISAC with a specialized actinide target.


=== ISAC and ARIEL facilities for rare-isotope beams ===
The ISAC and ARIEL (under construction) facilities produces and uses heavy ion beams to produce short-lived isotopes for study. Proton beam from the main accelerator is used as a driver beam at ISAC via beamline BL2A and one of the two ARIEL target stations via beamline BL4N (under construction) to produce beams of exotic isotopes which are further accelerated using linear accelerators. The second target station at ARIEL uses an electron beam from the TRIUMF elinac as a driver beam. Several experiments study the properties and structure of these exotic isotopes along with their nucleosynthesis.  Between ISAC-I and ISAC-II, many experiments can be completed.


==== ISAC-I facility ====
In the ISAC-I facility, 500 MeV protons at up to 100 μA can be steered onto one of two production targets to produce radioactive isotopes. The isotopes pass through a heated tube to a source where they are ionized, accelerated off the source's high-voltage platform at up to 60 kV and sent through a mass separator to select the ion beam of choice. The beam is transported in the low-energy beam transport (LEBT) electrostatic beam line and sent via a switch-yard to either the low-energy experimental area or to a series of room-temperature accelerating structures to the ISAC-I medium-energy experimental area. Experiments at ISAC-I include:


===== 8π spectrometer =====
A microscope used to examine the behaviour of atomic nuclear produced, which are collected at the centre of 8pi where they undergo radioactive decay.  The main component of the 8π spectrometer are the Hyper-pure Germanium detectors used to observe gamma rays emitted from excited states of daughter nuclei. [1]


===== DRAGON =====
The Detector of Recoils And Gammas Of Nuclear Reactions (DRAGON) is an apparatus designed to measure the rates of nuclear reactions important in astrophysics, particularly nucleosynthesis reactions which occur in the explosives environments of nova, supernova, and x-ray bursters. [2]


===== Laser spectroscopy =====
The Collinear Fast-Beam Laser Spectroscopy (CFBS) experiment at TRIUMF is designed to exploit the high beam-intensity and radioisotope-production capability of TRIUMF's ISAC facility, as well as modern ion-trap beam-cooling techniques, in order to measure the hyperfine energy levels and isotope shifts of short-lived isotopes using laser spectroscopy. [3]


===== TITAN =====
TRIUMF's Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear Science (TITAN) measures the mass of short-lived isotopes with high precision.  Radioactive isotopes from ISAC are sent to TITAN to undergo cooling, charge-breeding and trapping.  The entire process occurs in about 10 milliseconds, allowing radioactive isotopes with short half lives to be studied. [4]


===== TRINAT =====
TRINAT, TRIUMF's Neutral Atom Trap, holds a cluster of neutral atoms suspended in a very small space, in high vacuum, allowing for the study of decay products of radioactive atoms. [5]


==== ISAC-II facility ====
The rare-isotope beams produced in the ISAC-II facility are transported in the low-energy beam transport (LEBT) electrostatic beam line and sent via a switch-yard to either the low-energy experimental area or to a series of room-temperature accelerating structures in the ISAC-I medium-energy experimental area. For high-energy delivery, the drift tube linac (DTL) beam is deflected north along an S-bend transfer line to the ISAC-II superconducting linear accelerator (SC-linac) for acceleration above the Coulomb barrier (5–11 MeV/u). TRIUMF began developing superconducting accelerator technology in 2001 and is now a leader in the field with a demonstrated accelerating gradient (at low beta) significantly above other operating facilities. Experiments at ISAC-II include:


===== EMMA =====
The ElectroMagnetic Mass Analyzer (EMMA) (completion date 2016) is a recoil mass spectrometer for TRIUMF's ISAC-II facility. ISAC-II will provide intense beams of radioactive ions with masses up to 150 atomic mass units to international scientists studying nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics. The energies of these beams will depend on the specific nuclei being accelerated, but typical top speeds will range from 10–20% of the speed of light. [6]


===== HERACLES =====
Formerly known as the Chalk River/Laval array, HERACLES consists of 150 scintillators detectors covering almost 4-pi. It was used in over a dozen of experiments in the last ten years for multi-fragmentation studies at intermediate energies (10 to 100 MeV/A). [7]


===== TIGRESS =====
The TRIUMF-ISAC Gamma-Ray Escape Suppressed Spectrometer (TIGRESS) is a state-of-the art new gamma-ray spectrometer designed for a broad program of nuclear physics research with the accelerated radioactive ion beams provided by the ISAC-II superconducting linear accelerator. [8]


==== ISAC-I/II ====
The experiments listed below utilize both facilities.


===== TUDA =====
A general purpose facility for studying nuclear reactions of astrophysical significance with solid state detectors.[9]


===== TACTIC =====
An ionization chamber with full track reconstruction capabilities for studying reactions of astrophysical importance.[10]


===== DSL =====
TRIUMF's Doppler Shift Lifetimes facility, which is an experimental setup for the measurement of the lifetimes of excited states of nuclei.[11]


=== ATLAS Canadian Tier-1 Data Centre ===
The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN uses proton-proton collisions at the highest energy ever achieved in the laboratory to look for the Higgs Boson, the particle central to the current model of how subatomic particles attain mass. ATLAS will also search for phenomena ""beyond the standard model"" of particle physics such as supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and quark compositeness. The ATLAS detector will observe the particles emerging from the roughly 900 million proton-proton collisions per second and, although fast electronics will filter the events so that only those most likely to be of interest will be recorded, ATLAS will produce 3.5–5.0 petabytes of data per year (one petabyte is one million gigabytes). In addition, secondary data sets will be produced that could double the amount of data produced.
In order to analyze this enormous amount of information, CERN is coordinating an international network of large high-performance computing centres that are linked by grid computing tools so that they act as one huge system. This network is called the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG). The Canadian Tier-1 Data Centre, located at TRIUMF, works with nine of the other ATLAS Tier-1 centres in the world to process the raw data produced by the experiment. In addition, Tier-2 centres located in universities, both in Canada and abroad, are used to further process the results of the Tier-1 analysis and extract groundbreaking physics results from the data. The Tier-2 centres will also be the primary sites for computer simulations of ATLAS, which is an integral part of the data analysis.


=== Centre for Molecular and Materials Science ===
TRIUMF uses subatomic particles as probes of materials structure at the Centre for Molecular and Materials Science (CMMS).  The chief techniques are μSR and β-NMR.


==== μSR ====
TRIUMF utilizes a technique called μSR, a powerful probe into materials like semiconductors, magnets and superconductors. Beams of positive muons are created with their spins lined up in the same direction. When these beams are shot into a material, the muons' spins precess (wobble like a top) around the local magnetic fields in the material. The unstable muons soon decay into positrons; since these antielectrons tend to be emitted in the direction of the muons' spin, μSR scientists can examine how the internal magnetic fields of different materials have affected the muons' spins by observing the directions in which the positrons are emitted.


==== β-NMR ====
β detected NMR is an exotic form of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in which the nuclear spin precession signal is detected through the beta decay of a radioactive nucleus. The central question to be studied is how the local electronic and magnetic properties near an interface or surface of new materials (e.g.,. a high Tc superconductor) differ from those of the bulk.


=== Laboratory for Advanced Detector Development ===
TRIUMF uses its expertise gained from the development of detectors for particle and nuclear physics, in collaboration with Canadian universities, to support advanced detector development for molecular and materials sciences and nuclear medicine.  TRIUMF's detector group designs and constructs electronic signal processing systems needed to handle the large volumes of data from modern detectors.


=== Nuclear Medicine Laboratories ===
The core of the TRIUMF nuclear medicine program is Positron Emission Tomography or PET imaging, a technique whereby tiny amounts of radioactive nuclei known as radioisotopes are combined with certain bio-molecules and injected into the body. The biomolecules can be “traced” by imaging the decay products (two photons produced by the decay of the radioactive nucleus via the emission of a positron) outside the body. PET allows the concentration of positron-labeled compounds to be determined quantitatively in space and time within the living body. PET is more sensitive than any other human imaging method, such as MRI or CT, especially for the detection of cancer.
The PET program facilities at TRIUMF include cyclotron systems for the production of radioisotopes, chemistry labs for the synthesis of radiopharmaceuticals and quality control labs. TRIUMF currently uses the TR-13 medical cyclotron and target systems for the production of 18F, 11C, and 13N. Radiopharmaceutical production facilities include the small modular clean room at the cyclotron for the synthesis of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). for BCCA as well as three chemistry annex labs for production and development of radiopharmaceuticals used in brain research and other programs at UBC.
Pacific Parkinson's Research Centre (PPRC) is a joint TRIUMF/UBC program studying central nervous system disorders. Approximately 80% of the studies are related to Parkinson's disease, and the remainder are related to mood disorders and Alzheimer's disease. The program has explored the origins, progression, and therapies of the disease as well as the complications arising from therapy using molecular imaging as the primary tool.
The Functional Imaging Program at the BCCA is a collaboration among the agency, TRIUMF, UBC, and the BC Children's Hospital. Capital acquired through the BC Provincial Health Services Authority Emerging Technologies Fund allowed purchase of the province's first hybrid PET/CT scanner in 2004. The clinical PET/CT program, located at BCCA's Vancouver Centre, was enabled by TRIUMF supplying 18F, the positron emitting radionuclide used in production of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). FDG, as a marker of glucose metabolism, is the tracer used in oncologic PET imaging, a diagnostic study which has become a standard of care in the management of many cancer types.


=== Proton and Neutron Irradiation Facilities ===
Beginning in 1995, TRIUMF has built up several beamlines that provide low-intensity, energetic proton and neutron beams to simulate radiation exposures either in space or terrestrial environments. Even at low intensity, several minutes of exposure in these beams can correspond to years of operation in space, air, or ground so that accelerated testing of electronics can be carried out.
These TRIUMF facilities, PIF & NIF, have since become recognized as premier test sites for space-radiation effects using protons and, with the capability of using these protons to produce a neutron-energy spectrum similar to that found at aircraft altitudes and at ground level, testing with neutrons is also possible. A large fraction of the proton users are Canadian space-related companies such as MDA Corporation, while neutron use is primarily by international companies for avionics, microelectronics and communications equipment, such as The Boeing Company or Cisco Systems, Inc.
Additionally, one of the beamlines was used for the cancer treatment of ocular melanoma at the Proton Therapy Centre which was operated in conjunction with the BC Cancer Agency and the UBC Department of Ophthalmology. Before proton treatment became available, the most common course of action was removal of the eye. Other possible treatments included surgical removal of the tumour (which has severe limitations), or implanting a radioactive disk on the wall of the eye under the tumour for some days. These alternatives were unsuitable for large tumours, and could damage sensitive parts of the eye, often resulting in loss of vision. After proton therapy, however, patients can retain useful vision. The protons enter the eye at a carefully controlled energy, and come to rest at a precise, predictable distance inside. They deposit their energy of motion (kinetic energy) in a very narrow layer, destroying living cells in that layer. Because the beam of protons is so concentrated and deposits its energy so predictably, we can successfully destroy a tumour while better preserving the other nearby parts of the eye. (The proton therapy program at TRIUMF was discontinued in 2019.)


== External scientific collaborations ==
TRIUMF is also involved in the development and construction of detectors and equipment for larger particle physics experiments located all over the world.


=== ALPHA ===
The international ALPHA Collaboration, focused on trapping antihydrogen with experiments based at CERN, includes members from TRIUMF.
 
The ALPHA-Canada team, led by TRIUMF research scientist Dr. Makoto C. Fujiwara, was recognized with the 2013 NSERC John C. Polanyi Award for their work with the ALPHA team at CERN in understanding antimatter.  The Canadian team included over a dozen scientists and students working in plasma, atomic, condensed matter, particle, detector, and accelerator physics, from the University of British Columbia (UBC), Simon Fraser University (SFU), the University of Calgary, York University, and TRIUMF.


=== KEK ===
TRIUMF has a longstanding collaborative relationship with Japan's KEK, which was further enhanced in December, 2015 when it was announced that each organization would be establishing branch offices at the other's respective institution to facilitate the advancement of their physics research activities.


=== Large Hadron Collider ===
TRIUMF accelerator physicists, engineers, and technical personnel have unique expertise for the design and construction of critical parts of the accelerator, such as assembling the liquid argon end cap calorimeters for the ATLAS detector. As well, TRIUMF was involved in the construction and procurement of several magnets and power supplies for the LHC itself. The resulting accelerator contributions were a necessary part of the Canadian investment in the project. TRIUMF is also home to the ATLAS-Canada Tier-1 Data Centre, funded by the Canada Foundation for Innovation. This centre will pre-process the raw data from the experiment prior to analysis by Canadian and foreign researchers. It will also provide domestic detector experts access to raw data for detailed calibration and monitoring.


=== SNO ===
TRIUMF first became actively involved in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) when the project needed engineering help. TRIUMF's Design Office and Machine Shop built key components of the detector. Moreover, TRIUMF scientists were involved in the project which was honored with the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics and the 2016 Fundamental Physics Prize for the discovery of neutrino oscillation.


=== SNOLAB ===
TRIUMF is involved with a number of projects at SNOLAB. Notable examples include the Helium and Lead Observatory (HALO) supernova neutrino detector which is part of the SuperNova Early Warning System (SNEWS) and Dark Matter Experiment using Argon Pulse-shape discrimination (DEAP) the most sensitive weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) detector to date.


=== T2K ===
TRIUMF is part of the T2K (Tokai-to-Kamioka) neutrino oscillation experiment in Japan. TRIUMF is involved in constructing a time projection chamber and fine-grained detectors composed of plastic scintillators for the T2K near detector, to measure the properties of the neutrino beam at its production site in Tokai before it travels 295 km to Kamioka, over which distance neutrino oscillations are expected to take place.


== TRIUMF Users' Group ==
The TRIUMF Users Group (TUG) is an international community of scientists and engineers with a special interest in the use of the TRIUMF facility. Its purpose is:

to provide a formal means for exchange of information relating to the development and use of the facility;
to advise members of the entire TRIUMF organization of projects and facilities available;
to provide an entity responsive to the representations of its members for offering advice and counsel to the TRIUMF management on operating policy and facilities.Any qualified scientist can join the users group. The group's interests are looked after by an elected committee (TRIUMF Users' Executive Committee or TUEC). Part of TUEC's responsibilities is to organize meetings on behalf of the membership were necessary. At least one meeting, the annual general meeting (AGM), is held each year near the beginning of December. A link to the TUG website is listed in the external links below.

467,Brentwood Town Centre,"Brentwood Town Centre (often referred to as Brentwood Mall) is a shopping mall in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. It is located in the Brentwood area of North Burnaby, at the intersection of Willingdon Avenue and Lougheed Highway, approximately 1.5 kilometres (0.9 mi) from the city of Vancouver.


== History ==
Opened in August 1961 as Brentwood Mall, the complex initially consisted of a partially open-air strip centre and enclosed mall. In the 1980s, a second level was added to the enclosed section.


=== Redevelopment ===
As of November 2014, the 11-hectare (28-acre) Brentwood Town Centre site is undergoing major redevelopment as part of a development initiative entitled ""The Amazing Brentwood"", which aims to create a master-planned neighbourhood. It will consist of 120,000 m2 (1,300,000 sq ft) of retail space, 46,000 m2 (500,000 sq ft) of office space, and multiple residential high-rise towers when complete.


== Transportation ==
Brentwood Town Centre is directly connected to Brentwood Town Centre station on the Millennium Line of Metro Vancouver's SkyTrain rapid transit system.

468,"Killarney, Vancouver","Killarney is a neighbourhood in East Vancouver, British Columbia with a population of over 28,000 in 2011 and lies in the far southeast corner of the city. It is on the south slope of the ridge that rises above the Fraser River, and contains a collection of single-family residences with a few multi-family homes as well as the townhouses and high-rises of the Fraserlands development along the river.


== Geography ==
The Killarney neighbourhood, which contains the area known as Champlain Heights, runs north from the Fraser River to its north border along East 41st Avenue and Kingsway, and stretches from Boundary Road, Vancouver's eastern border with Burnaby, British Columbia, to a line including Elliott Street and Vivian Drive on the western border. The neighbourhood is mostly built on the slope of the rise from the Fraser River, facing southward across Richmond, and is focused around Rupert Street (which merges with Kerr Street near 49th Avenue).
The neighbourhood contains a number of green spaces that are reflective of its history as one of the last areas to be developed in the Vancouver area.


== History ==
The Killarney area was one of the last portions of Vancouver to be developed, and was mostly second-growth forest until after World War II. Farms had been cut out of the forest since 1868, when William Rowling, a surveyor in the British military, was given a land grant that eventually consisted of much of southern Killarney, including all of its riverfront land. George Wales was the first to settle in northern Killarney in 1878, and eventually development began to move from the more populated areas to the west as the interurban streetcar line was constructed north of Kingsway.
After World War II, development accelerated with a growing need for housing, and the street grid moved south towards Southeast Marine Drive. In the 1970s, Champlain Heights was developed as a comprehensive residential development.
As a later developing neighbourhood, Killarney does not have the same level of heritage properties as other areas in Vancouver, though it does boast a number of examples of 1920s farmhouses and is well known for long-standing trees and natural heritage.
In the 1990s, the land along the Fraser River was a hotbed of development. Known as the Fraserlands, this area now boasts hundreds of townhome units and a number of residential highrise buildings, with more presently under construction. The city of Vancouver has recently begun consultations on the possible development of a former log yard at the eastern end of the Fraserlands, with the intention of developing it into a sustainable community of its own.


== Demographics ==


== Features ==

Killarney is well populated with parks and green spaces, reflecting its forest history. The largest is Everett Crowley Park, along Kerr Street and north of Marine Drive; this park was originally a forested area with a ravine and waterfall that was used as a landfill for many years before being closed and reclaimed to its present form. Across Kerr is the Fraserview Golf Course, which also includes a number of trails. Killarney Park is now the location of Killarney Secondary School and a Community Centre, which features a swimming pool, is built on a reclaimed bog. There is also a Community Centre in Champlain Heights, near a commercial sector at the corner of East 54th and Kerr. A trail runs along the Fraser River through green space stretching along the riverfront. It also features a newly constructed Olympic ice rink for the 2010 Winter Olympics.
The music video of Canadian singer Michael Bublé`s song ""Haven't Met You Yet"" was shot in Killarney Market at the corner of East 49th Avenue and Elliott Street in Killarney. After 25 years as a family-owned grocer, Killarney Market was sold to another local independent retailer in 2018. The location is now known as 88 Supermarket.

469,Marpole Loop,"Marpole Loop is a public transit exchange in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The exchange is a  part of Metro Vancouver's TransLink transit network. It is the southernmost transit exchange located within the city of Vancouver.


== History ==
Marpole Loop originally opened on July 4, 1905 as an interurban station on the BCER Lulu Island line. Interurban services continued to  operate until February 28, 1958, coinciding with the completion of the ""Rails-to-Rubber"" transition.As of September 7, 2009, suburban routes that served Marpole Loop from Delta, Richmond, Surrey and White Rock, were rerouted to terminate at Bridgeport station on SkyTrain's Canada Line.In mid-2019, TransLink installed a charging station at the loop for its battery-electric bus pilot project. Revenue operation for the charging station began on September 11, 2019.


== Location ==
Located on Southwest Marine Drive at the northern foot of the Arthur Laing Bridge, which connects Vancouver to Richmond and Vancouver International Airport. Part of the exchange is located on Marine Drive itself, and part of it is located in an area separated from regular traffic. Because of this arrangement, the loop covers a large area; TransLink maps sometimes designate the loop as ""Hudson"" to avoid confusion.The loop is located next to the Vancouver Transit Centre, which replaced the Oakridge Transit Centre in September 2006. The transit depot houses the city of Vancouver's public transit fleet. Marpole Loop can accommodate trolley buses, regular length diesel buses and articulated buses.

The facility refines crude and synthetic oil into gasoline, diesel, jet fuels, asphalts, heating fuels, heavy fuel oils, butanes, and propane. Crude oil is supplied to the facility from Northern British Columbia and Alberta through the 1,200-kilometre Kinder Morgan Pipe Line.  The refinery is divided into Area 1 (the original site) now used for offices and oil storage and Area 2 the modern refining area.  The refinery has a Nelson Complexity Index of 9.1
Former and original owner-operator Chevron sold its Canadian assets to Parkland Fuel Corp for C$1.46 billion ($1.09 billion) in April 2017, including 129 gasoline stations, three terminals and the Burnaby oil refinery.
According to the Oil & Gas Journal, the refinery completed a major turnaround in Spring 2020. 


== History ==
The refinery was established in 1935 by Standard Oil of California as one of few heavy industries in the area at that time - 2000 bbls/day. Major expansion took place in the mid 1950s to 11,000 bbls/day as part of post war BC building boom. Further capacity increases in the mid 1970s to 35,000 bbls/day including a steady advancement in technology. Other lower mainland refineries were converted to terminals in the early 1990s with production transferred to Alberta.

471,Guichon Creek (Still Creek tributary),"Guichon Creek is one of the most significant tributaries of Still Creek, an important waterway in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.
According to a map and materials by Heritage Advisory Committee and Environment and Waste Management Committee of the City of Burnaby (1993), Guichon Creek was named after the Guichon family who were pioneer residents of Delta and who also owned some of the land in Burnaby where this creek is. Even Willingdon Avenue was once known as Guichon Road. In the 1880s a log cabin was built at the top of the ravine running along this major Burnaby thoroughfare. Early residents of the area believe that it was used by sportsmen from Vancouver and New Westminster as a base for hunting expeditions in the wilds of Burnaby where bears and deer roamed free.
By 1912 Guichon Creek had become home to the Phillips-Hoyt Lumber Company which put a dam on the waterway to create a canal for transporting logs to a storage pond and a sawmill located on the site now occupied by the British Columbia Institute of Technology. The pond became a favourite fishing place and swimming hole for the locals.
In 2006, Guichon Creek was restored to largely natural state thanks to the efforts of local wild nature enthusiasts with the support of BCIT.","['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg']",49.25861110999999681325789424590766429901123046875,-123.0013888900000011972224456258118152618408203125
472,Regent College,"Regent College is a graduate school of Christian studies, located next to the campus of the University of British Columbia in the University Endowment Lands west of Vancouver, British Columbia, and is an affiliated college of that university. Not affiliated with a particular religious denomination, Regent College is a transdenominational evangelical Protestant institution in its general outlook. The school's stated mission is to ""cultivate intelligent, vigorous, and joyful commitment to Jesus Christ, His church, and His world.""
About 500 students are enrolled in full- or part-time studies. In any given year, one-third to one-half of students are Canadian, another one-quarter to one-third are American, and the remaining twenty to thirty per cent come from around the globe. Chinese students make up a considerable proportion of the latter group, whether from the Mainland, Taiwan, or the Chinese diaspora. Hong Kong is home to more Regent alumni/ae than any other city in the world after Vancouver. Regent includes many students each year from Australia, New Zealand and the UK, with recent students coming from countries as diverse as Kazakhstan, Korea, South Africa, Indonesia, India, Finland, and Brazil.


== History ==
Regent was established in 1968 to provide graduate theological education to the laity, and only in 1979 started a program to train students who will become clergy. After the first summer school class, the graduate Diploma of Christian Studies began; within two years, enrollment grew from 4 to 44 students and the Master of Christian Studies was added. Affiliation with UBC followed in 1975, and accreditation by the Association of Theological Schools in 1985. The last comprehensive evaluation occurred in 2010.
The principals and presidents of the college have been James M. Houston (1970–1978), Carl Armerding (1978–1988), Walter Wright Jr. (1988–2000) and outgoing president Rod Wilson (2000–2015). Jeffrey P. Greenman began his term as the fifth president on February 1, 2015. Greenman is the first alumnus of Regent College to become president.Regent initially rented rooms in various buildings at UBC, including St. Andrews Hall and Vancouver School of Theology, and occupied two fraternity houses on Wesbrook Mall for a time. In 1989, Regent moved into its own new building in the current location at the corner of Wesbrook & University, with the distinctive green roof. A subsequent capital campaign finished in 2006, adding the John Richard Allison Library and the Windtower to Regent College's architectural distinctiveness.


== Academic programs ==
The college offers four main graduate programs, all ATS-accredited:

Graduate Diploma in Christian Studies (DipCS)
Master of Arts in Christian Studies (MACS)
Master of Arts in Theological Studies (MATS)
Master of Divinity (MDiv)
Master of Theology (ThM)
Master of Arts in Leadership, Theology, and Society (MALTS)


== Student life ==
On Tuesdays during fall and winter term, the college community gathers for chapel, followed by optional community group meetings and a lunch of homemade soup and bread. The Regent College Student Association oversees a variety of student life activities and services, including Taste of the World, book sales, an annual Christmas Party, an annual retreat, the Regent Spouse's Network, and more.
Because Regent is a UBC affiliate school, Regent students qualify for the U-Pass and the AMS insurance plan, and may make use of other UBC services such as the library system, health centre, and the pool.


== Alumni and faculty ==
More than 4,500 students have graduated from Regent College and, due to the summer programs, over 30,000 students have taken classes. After Vancouver, Hong Kong hosts the second greatest number of Regent graduates, with other major pockets in Seattle, Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Singapore and London.
At present, Regent College employs 17 full-time faculty. Notable faculty emeriti include Eugene Peterson, Maxine Hancock, Loren Wilkinson, Gordon T. Smith, Paul Stevens, Gordon Fee, J.I. Packer and Bruce Waltke. Summer school classes are often taught by some notable Christian thinkers, including N.T.

It is crossed by, and has on and off ramps for, the Knight Street Bridge, which is one of the main bridges between the City of Vancouver and Richmond.
Originally agricultural, its land is now mainly used for industrial purposes.  The island is host to a number of auto wreckers. Mitchell Island now includes the area of Twigg Island, originally known as Mason's Island and also known as Bell Island, a name which was rescinded in 1951 after the channel separating it from Mitchell Island was filled in.  Also incorporated into Mitchell Island after the intervening channel was Eburne Island.  The island's name commemorates the original Crown Grantee, Alexander Mitchell.The only way to get on and off the island by road or walking is through on- and off-ramps near the middle of the Knight Street Bridge.  There is also a bus stop near the exit and entrance from the bridge; however, buses do not travel on the island itself.

474,Brentwood Park,"Brentwood is a neighborhood in the Westside of Los Angeles, California, United States.


== History ==
Modern development began after the establishment of the 600-acre (2.4 km2) Pacific Branch of the National Home for Disabled Soldiers and Sailors in the 1880s. A small community sprang up outside that facility's west gate, taking on the name Westgate. Annexed by the City of Los Angeles on June 14, 1916, Westgate's 49 square miles (130 km2) included large parts of what is now the Pacific Palisades and a small portion of today's Bel-Air. Westgate Avenue is one of the last reminders of that namesake.

Local traditions include a Maypole erected each year on the lawn of the Archer School for Girls, carrying on that set by the Eastern Star Home previously housed there. This building was the exterior establishing shot for the ""Mar Vista Rest Home"" that provided a key scene in the 1974 film Chinatown.


=== Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone Designation ===

The State Cal-Fire Authority officially designated all of Brentwood a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone from Mulholland down to Sunset Boulevard, due to the long, uninterrupted border of urban-wildlife interface in the Brentwood hillsides that has resulted in multiple fires over many years, destroying entire neighborhoods and requiring numerous evacuations. For this reason, the Brentwood community has been strongly in favor of halting all further development in the hillside and canyon areas.
On November 6, 1961, a construction crew working in Sherman Oaks in the San Fernando Valley north of Brentwood on the far side of the Santa Monica Mountains noticed smoke and flames in a nearby pile of rubbish. Within minutes, Santa Ana winds gusting up to 60 mph (100 km/h) sent burning brush aloft and over the ridge into Brentwood.
More than 300 police officers helped evacuate 3,500 residents during the 12-hour fire, and some 2,500 firefighters battled the blaze, pumping water from neighborhood swimming pools to douse flames. Pockets of the fire smoldered for several days. Even as firefighters battled what was to become a Bel Air disaster, another fire erupted in Santa Ynez Canyon to the west. That blaze was contained the next day after consuming nearly 10,000 acres (40 km2) and nine structures and burning to within a mile of Bel Air and Brentwood. The fires were the fifth-worst conflagration in the nation's history at the time, burning 16,090 acres (65 km2), destroying more than 484 homes and 190 other structures and causing an estimated $30 million in damage.


=== O.J. Simpson trial ===

Brentwood was the site of the 1994 stabbing deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, outside Nicole Brown Simpson's Bundy Drive townhouse. Nicole's ex-husband, football player and actor O.J. Simpson, was acquitted of the murders, but was later found liable for the deaths in a civil trial. O.J. Simpson's Brentwood home was subsequently sold. The new owners demolished Simpson’s home and built a new residence.


== Geography ==


=== Boundaries ===
The district is located at the base of the Santa Monica Mountains, bounded by the San Diego Freeway on the east, Wilshire Boulevard on the south, the Santa Monica city limits on the southwest, Sullivan Canyon/Westridge Trail on the west and Mulholland Drive on the north.


=== Environment ===

Brentwood, like nearby Santa Monica, has a temperate climate influenced by marine breezes off the Pacific Ocean.  Residents frequently wake to a ""marine layer"", a cover of clouds brought in at night which burns off by mid-morning. The topography is generally split into two characters, broadly divided by Sunset Boulevard: the area north of Sunset is defined by ridges and canyons of the Santa Monica Mountains and is located in a Cal-Fire designated Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone; south of Sunset the area is mostly flat. The area South of San Vicente features an underground spring which bubbles up into a small creek along ""the Gully"" near the Brentwood Country Club.


== Demographics ==
The 2000 U.S. census counted 31,344 residents in the 15.22-square-mile Brentwood neighborhood—or 2,059 people per square mile. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 33,312. Since 2010, the population has gradually shifted to younger families with children in local schools looking for single family homes north of San Vicente Blvd and executives seeking to live in higher-end, low maintenance condos within walking distance to the San Vicente commercial center.
The racial breakdown is whites, 84.2%; Asians, 6.5%; Latinos, 4.5%;  blacks, 1.2%; and others, 3.6%.  Iran (27.2%) and the United Kingdom (4.8%) were the most common places of birth for the 21.1% of the residents who were born abroad—which was a low percentage for Los Angeles as a whole.Brentwood has made strong efforts to have inclusive housing stock, with 49% of residents living in single family homes and 51% living in dense zoning/multifamily residences. The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $112,927 and renters occupied 48.4% of the housing stock. As of June, 2020, 20% of Brentwood multifamily units qualified for Fannie Mae loans and the starting price of studio apartments and one bedrooms was within $100 of HUD vouchers in Los Angeles, allowing residents across a range of income levels to find housing in the community.


== Notable sights ==

San Vicente Boulevard is divided by a wide median on which stand many large coral trees. This green belt replaced a Pacific Electric trolley track, and the trees have been named a City of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.Brentwood features a number of residential sub-districts:

Brentwood Circle: a gated community east of Barrington and north of Sunset that was created when the Getty Museum was built.
Brentwood Glen: an area bounded by Sunset, the 405 Freeway, and the Veterans Administration, it is an enclave of small lots and single family homes
Bundy Canyon: home to Mount St. Mary's College and an emergency ingress entrance to Getty Center (though the latter is accessible only from Sepulveda for the public)
Crestwood Hills: includes a cluster of protected, architecturally significant mid-century modern residences located in the northern part of Kenter Canyon
Mandeville Canyon: westernmost part of Brentwood, north of Sunset; extends about three miles to the north and is the longest dead end street in the City of Los Angeles.
Sullivan Canyon: a mostly equestrian neighborhood with a private riding ring.

== Recreation ==

Brentwood's Barrington Recreation Center has an indoor gymnasium which converts into a small auditorium with a capacity of 250. Outdoors is a lighted baseball diamond, an unlighted baseball diamond, lighted indoor basketball courts, lighted outdoor basketball courts, a children's play area, picnic tables and lighted tennis courts. As of March, 2018, Barrington Park received a grade of ""D"" from the Los Angeles Parks and Rec Department due its poor facilities; upon investigation, the Brentwood Community Council discovered $1.1M in missing funds that were supposed to be used for capital upgrades at the park and fought the city for their return - successfully. With the funds back in place, the Community has worked to improve the park. The Barrington Dog Park is across the street from the recreation center and is part of Barrington Veterans Park, which is owned by the West LA VA and leased to the City of Los Angeles.


== Economy and businesses ==
The vast majority of office space in Brentwood is rented to professional services firms: accountants, lawyers, medical care.
There are three upscale commercial areas: Brentwood Country Mart, Barrington Plaza and the San Vicente Business District, which include restaurants, clothing stores, and other high-end retailers.
A few long time businesses should be noted: Brent-Air Pharmacy, run by the founding Lassoff family from its inception until June 2007, served Brentwood for more than 50 years. The drug store has been the scene of many famous scandals and, like its defunct West Hollywood cousin Schwab's, is known as the pharmacy to the stars, where many now-notable actors and actresses worked as delivery boys or ""candy counter"" girls.
The Brentwood Country Mart, near the corner of San Vicente Blvd and 26th Street next to the Santa Monica city limit, is a shopping and food center that first opened in 1948.
Vicente Foods is an independently owned and operated grocery market that has served Brentwood since 1948. Other local markets include Whole Foods and Ralphs.
A popular area for dining and coffee for local residents is located in Brentwood Village at the intersection of Barrington and Sunset. More than a dozen restaurants and coffee shops are located within a two-block stretch offering a wide variety of cuisine.
Dutton's Brentwood Books, a local landmark called by Sunset magazine ""the last of the truly independent bookstores"", closed its doors in April, 2008.


== Government and infrastructure ==


=== Brentwood Leadership & City Services ===
Brentwood and Pacific Palisades both chose to form Community Councils in order to have an independent voice with regard to issues that impact their communities, such as their joint Community Plan, which is a City approved document that governs the aesthetics of zoning and design for the neighborhoods. The Brentwood Community Council holds monthly public meetings, as does its Land Use Committee, and has been a powerful and effective voice for the community since the 1990s. The BCC Board includes members from all local HOA's, plus members representing schools, business, environment, transportation, civic affairs and a group dedicated only to residents under 40, called Brentwood '49. City Services are provided by the Los Angeles Fire Department Station 19 is in Brentwood. The Los Angeles Police Department operates the West Los Angeles Community Police Station in West Los Angeles, serving Brentwood. The City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power provide utilities. All areas of Brentwood are served by a Residents Association of some kind.


=== Homelessness, the West LA VA and VA Master Plan Redevelopment ===
While the annual County of Los Angeles homeless count rarely attributes more than 50 persons as homeless in Brentwood, they are invariably residents of the persistent homeless encampment along San Vicente Blvd, next to the West Los Angeles Veterans Affairs property. The majority of the homeless persons are Veterans. While the VA does have available beds and treatment programs, many Veterans find it hard to take the first step to accept VA assistance for a variety of reasons, including deep mistrust of the VA, dishonorable discharges that prevent them from receiving services, the mandatory sober living environment on the VA campus. The Brentwood Community Council took the lead in 2013 to help establish Veteran safe parking and safe camping programs, which allow Veterans to take an 'intermediate step"" between homelessness and accepting full VA assistance and these programs have been successful and have grown over time. Some Veterans believed the VA was derelict in its duty to provide housing and successfully sued the VA, proving that multiple leases of VA property had been used for fraudulent means. Several individuals went to prison, including a former VA executive. As a result of the settlement in the Veterans civil suit against the VA, the $1B VA Master Plan Redevelopment of the West LA VA property, including 2000+ units of housing, was approved by Congress in 2019 and breaks ground in late 2020.

475,Thunderbird Sports Centre,"The Doug Mitchell Thunderbird Sports Centre (formerly UBC Winter Sports Centre, also known as UBC Thunderbird Arena) is a LEED Silver certified indoor arena in Greater Vancouver, on the campus of the University of British Columbia. Located in the University Endowment Lands, it is just outside the city limits of Vancouver, British Columbia. The arena is home to the UBC Thunderbirds men's and women's ice hockey teams, and contains one international-size 61 m × 30 m (200 ft × 98.4 ft) ice rink.
The facility was built around an older ice hockey facility, the historic Father Bauer Arena, which opened in October 1963. This was named after the late Father David Bauer, who, together with Bob Hindmarch, established Canada’s first national hockey team at UBC in 1963 in preparation for the 1964 Winter Olympics. The UBC Thunderbird Arena replaced the Father Bauer Arena as the home of the UBC Thunderbirds ice hockey team. It is also the practice facility for  Vancouver's NHL team, the Vancouver Canucks.
The main ice rink has 7,500 seats and can expand to 8,000 for concerts. The other rinks are Father Bauer Arena and Protrans Arena with spectator capacities of 980 and 200, respectively.Construction began in April 2006 with the refurbishment of the Father Bauer Arena and the addition of a new practice arena. The new stadium arena was opened on July 7, 2008.
On August 21, 2009, the Thunderbird Sports Centre was renamed Doug Mitchell Thunderbird Sports Centre in honour of Doug Mitchell, an UBC alumnus, lawyer, and amateur and professional sports leader.


== 2010 Vancouver Olympics ==
The venue was used for several men's and women's ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics, and was used for sledge hockey in the 2010 Winter Paralympics.


== Davis Cup ==
The venue was used in Canada's first round draw against France in the Davis Cup in February 2012, and it was used again in February and April 2013 when Canada faced Spain and then Italy.

476,Iona Island (British Columbia),"Iona Island in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada was formerly an island, but is now a peninsula physically connected to Sea Island via a causeway and Ferguson Road. Iona is home to a primary sewage treatment plant (located in the middle), an animal refuge and a park (Iona Beach Regional Park). The Iona Sewage Plant is located near the centre of the island and has tours for the public. Iona Beach Regional Park also features a beach adjacent to wildlife from the nearby animal refuge. The park is managed by Metro Vancouver. Iona Island is located almost adjacent to the Vancouver International Airport. The park is mostly visited by birders, as the sewage ponds have attracted many rare shorebirds such as Spoon-billed Sandpiper, Great Knot, and Red-necked Stint.
Beachgoers are advised to avoid the park due to sewage emission at the tip of the Iona South Jetty. 


== Jetties ==
Two jetties stretch out into the Strait of Georgia from Iona Island:

Iona Jetty, the south jetty, juts out nearly 4 km (2.5 mi) into the Strait; recreational visitors can walk or cycle on the twin gravel trails atop and beside the large sewage pipe that stretches the length of the jetty.
North Arm Jetty, the north jetty, while longer, is not as popular; it is a sandy bar (as opposed to the gravel and concrete structure of Iona Jetty) that stretches towards the northwest, running parallel to the Vancouver shoreline and terminating at the University Endowment Lands, almost directly across from the University of British Columbia campus.The jetties are owned by the Government of Canada.

477,Swangard Stadium,"Swangard Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Central Park in Burnaby, British Columbia. Primarily used for soccer, rugby, football, and athletics, the stadium also used to be home to the Simon Fraser Clan football team and the Vancouver Whitecaps while they were in the Canadian Soccer League (CSL) and various US-based Division 2 leagues. It opened on April 26, 1969, and has a capacity of 5,288.


== History ==
In 1969, Vancouver Sun sports journalist Erwin Swangard raised nearly $1 million for the construction of an athletic stadium in Central Park in Burnaby, British Columbia. BC Premier W. A. C. Bennett officially named the stadium after Swangard at its opening on April 26, 1969. Swangard was not present on the day of the opening, having been sent to start a newspaper in Nigeria.


=== Vancouver Whitecaps ===
The city of Vancouver launched a professional soccer team in 1986, named the Vancouver 86ers (now known as the Whitecaps). The Canadian Soccer League (CSL) club began playing in 1987 and made Swangard Stadium their home pitch. The stadium served its last season as the Whitecaps' home in 2010, as the club joined Major League Soccer (MLS) in 2011. As Swangard does not meet MLS standards for capacity, the City of Burnaby initially proposed to keep the team in Burnaby by renovating the stadium and expanding its capacity to 20,000 seats. This plan, however, fell through, and the Whitecaps eventually decided they wanted to move to a new, larger soccer-specific home at the Whitecaps Waterfront Stadium. Currently the Whitecaps are playing at BC Place Stadium and president of the organization, Bob Lenarduzzi has stated the club intends to stay at BC Place for the time being and plans for a new stadium are all on hold.


=== International events ===
The stadium's capacity was temporarily increased to 10,000 for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup. In the past, it has hosted home games for the Canadian men's and women's soccer teams in Olympic and World Cup qualifying. In some cases, crowds in excess of 10,000 have witnessed games, with many of the fans standing. Swangard has also been the host stadium of the 2002 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship.


=== Other events ===
In 2013, the Vancouver Riptide, a professional ultimate team competing in the American Ultimate Disc League, became a tenant of Swangard Stadium but they ended play at end of 2017 season and are being moved to Portland, Oregon for the 2020 season.
In June 2014, Simon Fraser Clan announced that Swangard Stadium will be their football team's home field for the 2014 season. The Clan returned to their campus again starting with the 2016 season. Swangard Stadium is also used very frequently for track and field meets in the Lower Mainland.
In March 2015, the first Quidditch Canada National Championship took place at Swangaurd Stadium.The TSS FC Rovers of the USL League Two play their home soccer games at Swangard Stadium. They started in the 2017 season, playing in the Northwest Division. The TSS FC Rovers Women's Team of the Women's Premier Soccer League also use the stadium as their home, they started play in the 2017 season.

478,University Hill Secondary School,"University Hill Secondary School (generally known as U-Hill or Uhill) is a public secondary school in Vancouver, just west of the city limits of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.


== History ==
University Hill School began as a kindergarten to grade 12 school in September, 1927, on the site of what is now University Hill Elementary School. The K-12 school remained on that site until 1954, when the secondary school split from the elementary school and was built on a site on Acadia Road. Both schools were run by its own unique school board from 1927–1971, by special UEL elections. In 1971, the Schools joined the Vancouver School Board.
In 2013 the school moved to a new, larger building in Wesbrook Place in UBC. The former location became the location for the newly established Norma Rose Point Elementary.
The school is situated next to Pacific Spirit Regional Park. University Hill's school colour is purple. There are two logos, one is historical and popular, with UHS on a traditional shield; and the other is a stylized hawk symbolizing an affinity with nature and a commitment to action. 2003 marked the 75th anniversary of University Hill Secondary School.


== Academic Record ==
Since the school moved into a brand new facility on the UBC campus, the school's test scores have dropped considerably. In 2017 the school was rated 6.1/10.0, in 2018 the school was rated 5.2/10.0, and in 2019 the school was rated 5.3/10. The school is ranked 167th in BC, according to the Fraser Institute.In the past the school was ranked as the number one public secondary school in British Columbia, according to the Fraser Institute. At one point it even scored a perfect score. However, the ranking's methodology is controversial.


== Athletics ==
University Hill offers a variety of sports to its students including volleyball, soccer, rugby, table tennis, badminton and basketball, but fail to find success in most of the listed. In the fall, Junior and Senior Girls Volleyball is played in Vancouver Secondary Schools' leagues as well as Senior Boys' soccer.  In the winter, basketball and table tennis are offered for both boys and girls. Boys' Volleyball, girls' soccer, and boys' and girls' tennis are offered in the spring. In addition, badminton is also offered throughout the year. All school teams are known as the U-Hill Hawks.
In 1999-2000, The Hawks became provincial champions in swimming. Their team won by a landslide, setting several new records in both individual and relay events. All but one of the 9 records held by the U-Hill swim team are still standing. Ironically, there hasn't been a swim team since the Provincials in 2000.  The U-Hill track and field team placed third in the cities in 2008. Their junior boys team came in first overall in 2007 and 2009. The U-Hill golf team was started up in 2007-2008 year and in the spring of 2009 U-Hill won City Championships. However they were neglected from the AAA golf provincials for having been registered as a AA school. The U-Hill senior boys soccer team won the AA city championships in 1999 and 2004. They also made it to the city finals in the years 2006 and 2007. In 2014 the U-Hill girl's table tennis team took home the provincial championship beating out Burnaby North Secondary School in team competition and Magee Secondary School in singles competition.
In 2017, the juvenile boys basketball team finished 2nd in Vancouver and 10th in the province.
In November 2017, the Junior Girls' volleyball team won gold in the city finals and the Senior Girls' volleyball team placed 2nd place in the final. One year after the volleyball city finals, the Uhill Senior Boys Soccer team also captured the school’s very first championship for the sport.

479,Oak Street Bridge,"The Oak Street Bridge  is a crossing over the north arm of the Fraser River, the Canada Line, and several roads, in Metro Vancouver.


== History ==


=== Infrastructure ===
During the planning stage, it was known as the New Marpole Bridge, and steel plate girders salvaged from the second Granville Street Bridge made barges for constructing the foundations of the Oak St. Bridge.Opened in July 1957, the same date as the Moray Bridge, these links replaced the
Marpole Bridge (road). The new configuration created a more circuitous route between Vancouver and Vancouver International Airport (YVR), not restored until the Arthur Laing Bridge opened in 1975. Initially, the highway ended at No. 4 Rd, short of connecting with No. 5 Rd. and the Ladner Ferry. A primary objective was to create a fast route to the U.S. border, partially realized on the 1959 opening of the Deas Tunnel, and fully with the 1962 opening of Highway 99 to the border. A branch connected to the new Tsawwassen ferry terminal.Vancouver regarded the bridge as a source of unwanted traffic. Despite federal promises to share construction costs, the province ended up wholly financing the project. Costing about $9m, the structure is 1,839.2 metres (6,034 ft) long. The main spans comprise haunched (deeper at supports) steel girders and the approaches are steel or concrete girders. The central heavy steel deck plate girders, continuous over three spans, measure 60.9 metres (200 ft), 91.4 metres (300 ft), and 60.9 metres (200 ft). The freeway standard of Highway 99 ends where the bridge joins the Vancouver surface street grid. Average daily crossings were 85,000 cars in 2000. Averaging 18,000 cars on opening,  summer daily averages were 70,000 in 1970, 74,000 in 1975, and 71,000 in 1980.The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure for BC owns and maintains this high-level four-lane bridge. Cyclists are legally required to ride on the sidewalks.


=== Tolls ===
The premier announced that the 25-cent toll would remain for 12½ years to cover construction costs for both the Oak St. and Moray bridges. A week later, he revised this to two years, a promise not fulfilled. Initially to avoid tolls, most traffic used the Fraser Street Bridge, causing massive congestion, leaving Oak St. Bridge underused. Toll plazas existed on Sea Island Way and on the highway south off the bridge.On opening, the Deas Tunnel toll was 50 cents, but a combined tunnel/bridge ticket was 60 cents.However, weekly tickets offered huge savings. A book of 24 tickets usable at each crossing cost $1.25, amended to $1 for 20 tickets from June 1960.The premier announced that tolls would be lifted from all highways on April 1, 1964, but were removed at 7:30 pm the previous evening. George Massey, after whom the tunnel was renamed, and an outspoken opponent of the tolls, paid the final toll at the bridge that evening. The toll booths were removed and the roadway narrowed accordingly.Later, the Coquihalla Highway had staffed toll booths (1986–2008), and electronic tolling operated on the new Golden Ears (2009–2017), and Port Mann (2012–2017) bridges.


=== Maintenance, upgrades and incidents ===
During the morning rush hour of November 27, 1959, heavy fog and road ice caused pileups that damaged 150 cars. The largest involved 35 cars, the next 23 and the third 18. Seven people went to hospital.In 1964, a driver, who suffered stroke, plunged off the south end. Sustaining minor injuries from the accident, he died in hospital.The Oak St. Bridge/Highway 99 interchange with Bridgeport Rd./Sea Island Way was modified in 1969–70, and 2001. Despite extensive work on the bridge deck expansion joints in 1973–74, they were rebuilt during 1976–78, and the deck repaved. In 1980–81, major pier protection occurred.In 1995, owing to extensive deterioration of the bridge deck and precast sidewalk panels, two lanes were closed alternately for resurfacing the deck with a high performance concrete, followed by a waterproof membrane, and asphalt. Recent traffic accidents that highlighted important safety deficiencies prompted the installation of no-posts at the median and curbs. The deck joints were again replaced, and deteriorated concrete on the bridge underside removed and patched.The cast-in-place concrete girders of the southern approach were vulnerable to collapse from movements during soil liquefaction. To strengthen the under-reinforced girders, glass fibre reinforced polymer wraps, the most flexible of possible composites, were chosen. Installed over four separate contracts, the seismic retrofit was completed in 2002.


=== Neighbourhood redevelopment ===

After the bridge opened, more than 50 stores at Hudson and Marine Drive closed from lost business. Low-rise stucco apartments replaced older houses. Once the Arthur Laing Bridge opened, Granville Street developed as the commercial centre.At the south end of the Oak St. Bridge, construction started in 1960 on the first hotel at the highway interchange. Opening in 1962, the 62-room motor inn, initially called Delport Inn, then Airport Inn, was the birth of the Delta Hotels chain. Construction beginning in 1971, the 14-storey tower that opened the next year was the tallest building in Richmond. The project added 144 new suites, and included renovating and expanding the existing amenities. The property is now branded the Sandman Signature Hotel.Other hotels built in the immediate vicinity, and their current branding, are the Abercorn Inn (1981), Travelodge Hotel (1984), Accent Inn (1988), and Sandman Hotel Airport (1999).On cleared land hugging the east side of the southern approach, two midrise office buildings and two hotels are under construction. The Courtyard by Marriott and Residence Inn by Marriott brand hotels will provide 201 rooms.

480,UBC Farm,"The UBC Farm is a 24-hectare farm and forest system on the southern end of the University of British Columbia (UBC) campus in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The farm is run by the Centre for Sustainable Food Systems, which is part of the Faculty of Land and Food Systems, and has existed in its current form since 2000. It hosts a variety of crops and fruits, as well as some animals and composting facilities. Several academic programs allow the students to use the farm for research and teaching.


== History ==
The farm, located on traditional Musqueam First Nations territory, has been part of UBC since 1915. However, the farm of 1915 was not located at its current position, but reached from the Nitobe Memorial Garden to the Thunderbird Stadium. In 1970 the farm moved closer to its current position at Wesbrook Place. During the 1990s activity on the agricultural area at the south end of campus declined, and in 1997 the area was declared a Future Housing Reserve. A student-initiated program, supported by the Faculties of Science and Forestry, began in 1999 to advocate for the revival of the UBC Farm. 2008 saw the announcement of plans to reduce the size of the farm or move it somewhere else. This caused the Alma Mater Society club Friends of the UBC Farm to start a ""Save the Farm"" campaign and advocate for the conservation of the farm. This campaign caused a shift in policy, and on December 1, 2009, UBC's Board of Governors stated that the site of the UBC Farm would no longer be considered a housing reserve. In 2011 the area was declared a ""Green Academic"" zone, which ""will be kept primarily as open areas to support land-based teaching, research and community engagement"".


== Farm facilities and mission ==


=== Farm facilities ===
The farm consists of two small buildings, which can serve a variety of purposes, including as classroom, office, kitchen, storage, and processing areas, and it is surrounded by a coastal hemlock forest. Two tractors and other tools are stored in several sheds on site, and two glass greenhouses and three polytunnels offer to extend the seasons and further spread the crops. A 300 m3 composting facility can process the farm's and other local produce wholesalers' organic waste and turn it into soil fertilizer. Two trailers offer staff accommodation to take care of the animals 24 hours a day. The farm includes a wide range of crops and livestock, which represent the agricultural possibilities of the Pacific northwest. Vancouver's moderate maritime climate allows cultivation of certain crops year round. Over 70 different kind of apples grow in the heritage orchard, and the farm also features grapes, blueberries, raspberries, hops, and truffles. The farm normally hosts some free-range poultry and honeybee colonies and has occasionally been a seasonal home for cattle. It provides a habitat for ""a range of birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles not found elsewhere in the city"".


=== Farm mission ===
The farm's main objective is to offer UBC a wider arrange of possibilities to research and create more sustainable and healthy communities through interdisciplinary cooperation and hands-on learning. It aims to promote a better understanding of the relationship between society and ecological systems. Through sharing knowledge with the local community, it raises awareness about a healthy and sustainable lifestyle.


=== Farmers' markets and other events ===
From June through October, UBC Farm offers two farmers' markets every week, where farm produce is sold. On Saturdays the market is held at the UBC Farm, and on Wednesdays the produce is sold at UBC's Vancouver campus. Some produce is also sold to local restaurants, and a volunteer student organization provides a delivery service of the farm's produce. The farm occasionally hosts private events like weddings, birthday parties, and music events.


== Teaching programs ==


=== Curricular activities ===
UBC Farm provides students with resources to pursue land-based, hands-on research and learning. Several UBC degree programs cooperate with the farm, in particular the Faculty of Land and Foods Systems, and include the farm in many of their curricular activities. In 2010, 2,500 students from eight faculties participated in curricular activities based at the farm. The farm is also part of UBC's Campus as Living Lab initiative, which was introduced with UBC's commitment to sustainability.


=== Indigenous teaching ===
As part of Vancouver's Native Health Society (VNHS) project, a garden and a weekly community kitchen for Aboriginal people in Vancouver was established in 2005. The goal is to provide healthy food for Aboriginal people and to give elderly and young Aboriginals a space to interact and share knowledge. The native Musqueam community has a space to grow food and medicinal plants.


=== Children's Learning Garden ===
The farm also features a Children's Learning Garden, which offers Farm Discovery Tours for ""students from pre-kindergarten through secondary school"" during the school year, and Farm Wonders camps over spring break and in the summer. The garden also hosts the Intergenerational Landed Learning Project, a program run by the UBC Faculty of Education, which partners elementary students, seniors, and other community volunteers to grow food, cook, and learn together throughout the school year.


== Future plans for UBC Farm ==


=== Construction of two new buildings ===
Demand for bigger facilities at the UBC Farm has grown since 2000, and in 2012 it was announced that two new buildings are scheduled for construction at the farm site. The new buildings would include a replacement for the current Farm Centre and a residential sustainability college. The new centre is set to ""include classrooms, dry and wet labs, offices, kitchens, processing space, an area for the farmer's market, a small retail space, café and student study spaces"", while the college is to offer residential space for students to engage in ""practical participation at the Farm"".


=== Possible AMS brewery ===
In 2013 the AMS announced that plans for a student-run brewery in the new Student Union Building (SUB), set to open in 2014, had been cancelled for financial reasons. Instead of incorporating the brewery in the new SUB, plans were made to build a commercial student-run brewery at the UBC Farm. However, in UBC's Land Use Plan, no space is assigned to accommodate a brewery on the farm's area.

481,Knight Street Bridge,"The Knight Street Bridge is a crossing over the north arm of the Fraser River, the Canadian National Railway (CNR) line, and several roads, in Metro Vancouver.


== History ==


=== Infrastructure ===
The 1929 Vancouver Major Streets Plan designated the Clark-Knight corridor as a six-lane arterial road. The upgrade delayed for decades, Knight St. was never a streetcar route, and experienced less commercial and lower intensity development than nearby arterials. A late 1950s metropolitan highway planning committee recommendation included a proposed 1970s crossing in the vicinity, to relieve the Oak Street Bridge.Constructed 1969–1974, the structure was the second cast-in-place segmental cantilever bridge built in North America, the first being Quebec in 1964. For many years, the 109.7-metre (360 ft) main span held the world record for this design.
Each drop-in span, which joins the two separate parallel cantilever spans from the main piers, is an arched post-tensioned concrete girder, resting on rubber bearings at each end. Like Knight Street, the bridge was named after Robert Knight, a property owner in South Vancouver in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.During the planning stage, the project was known as the Fraser Street Bridge Replacement. At the official opening ceremony in January 1974, Graham Lea, provincial Minister of Highways, cut the ribbon. On hand were Gil Blair, mayor of Richmond, and Art Phillips, mayor of Vancouver. Totalling about $15M, including $3M for roadways, the province funded the scheme. On formation in 1999, TransLink assumed ownership and maintenance responsibilities.The configuration comprises an overpass of Marine Drive, the 238-metre (781 ft) Knight Street Bridge North, and the 1,198-metre (3,930 ft) Knight Street Bridge South. The six-lane medium-level bridge reduces to four lanes over Mitchell Island, the outside lanes becoming the off and on ramps for the island. The electrically heated deck minimizes winter de-icing. On the underside of the deck, the western spans carry a maintenance walkway, above which are a water pipe, gas pipe, and electrical lines. The navigational clearance is 19–23 metres (62–75 ft) at the apex, depending upon the tide.Upgrading Knight St., and eliminating the load weight restrictions associated with the previous structure, this Vancouver–Richmond link eased congestion, and connected to Highway 99, and since 1989, Highway 91. Averaging over 100,000 vehicle crossings daily, the bridge is the second busiest in the Lower Mainland. Cyclists are legally required to ride on the sidewalks.


=== Maintenance, upgrades and incidents ===
On January 15, 2000 the boom of a mobile crane transported on a barge named T.L. Sharpe, towed by the Sea Cap XII, struck the underside of the Knight Street Bridge at 1:45 PM, damaging the bridge and the fixtures secured underneath its deck. The impact caused the boom to bend and the crane to slide off the barge and sink, and the bridge was closed to traffic for about 48 hours. Water supply to Mitchell Island via the bridge was shut down for 25 days, and an emergency bypass water supply from Vancouver was installed. The incident prompted the City of Richmond to install a second water main to Mitchell Island in 2002.

In 2011, the bridge underwent a seismic retrofit of three abutments, which were vulnerable to settlement or collapse from movements during soil liquefaction. The subsurface conditions comprise dense till-like soils for the north bridge, but potentially liquefiable deltaic sediments for the south bridge. The north abutments and piers rest upon spread footings, whereas the south ones rest upon timber and steel-pipe piles. To densify the ground, 105 injection boreholes were drilled to a depth of 12.3 metres (40 ft) around one abutment, and filled at pressure with a low mobility grout up to the surface. Timber compaction piles were used for densification in other areas. Steel-pipe piles were installed at a pier adjacent to the riverbank.Ranking first in Vancouver, the bridge was the scene of more than 2,500 car accidents during 2013–2017, of which nearly half resulted in injuries or fatalities. The Marine Dr. on and off ramps have rated among Canada's most dangerous intersections. In 2017, the city made design and signalling changes to enhance safety, which included a new turn bay for westbound vehicles on SE Marine Dr. turning north, and a new shared walking and cycling path.During early 2020, the bridge underwent extensive rehabilitation that required overnight single lane closures in each direction. The work included lighting upgrades, pier repairs, and the replacement of crash cushions, signage, and bearing and expansion joints.


=== Land developments ===
Formerly, transport planning had not been coordinated with land use planning. However, the establishment of the Agricultural Land Reserve in 1973 encouraged the development of the Surrey plateau, and reduced encroachment upon the agricultural lowland of Richmond. If land use had been determined by market forces alone, development along the Knight St. extension south of the bridge would have created the largest industrial park in region. The initial zoning proposal was for a broader footprint south to Cambie Rd., but the final version provided the present narrower corridor south to Westminster Hwy.


=== Transit ===
In 2014, improvements to the Mitchell Island interchange included extended loading bays to aid bus manoeuvering, widening passenger walkways, installing over 60 metres (197 ft) of safety barriers, new traffic islands, and new signage.

482,D-Wave Systems,"D-Wave Systems, Inc. is a Canadian quantum computing company, based in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. D-Wave was the world's first company to sell computers to exploit quantum effects in their operation.  D-Wave's early customers include Lockheed Martin, University of Southern California, Google/NASA and Los Alamos National Lab.
In 2015, D-Wave's 2X Quantum Computer with more than 1,000 qubits was installed at the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab at NASA Ames Research Center. They have subsequently shipped systems with 2,048 qubits. In 2019, D-Wave announced a 5000 qubit system available mid-2020, using their new Pegasus chip with 15 connections per qubit.


== History ==
D-Wave was founded by Haig Farris (former chair of board), Geordie Rose (former CEO/CTO), Bob Wiens (former CFO), and Alexandre Zagoskin (former VP Research and Chief Scientist). Farris taught a business course at the University of British Columbia (UBC), where Rose obtained his PhD, and Zagoskin was a postdoctoral fellow. The company name refers to their first qubit designs, which used d-wave superconductors.
D-Wave operated as an offshoot from UBC, while maintaining ties with the Department of Physics and Astronomy. It funded academic research in quantum computing, thus building a collaborative network of research scientists. The company collaborated with several universities and institutions, including UBC, IPHT Jena, Université de Sherbrooke, University of Toronto, University of Twente, Chalmers University of Technology, University of Erlangen, and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. These partnerships were listed on D-Wave's website until 2005. In June 2014, D-Wave announced a new quantum applications ecosystem with computational finance firm 1QB Information Technologies (1QBit) and cancer research group DNA-SEQ to focus on solving real-world problems with quantum hardware.On May 11, 2011, D-Wave Systems announced D-Wave One, described as ""the world's first commercially available quantum computer"", operating on a 128-qubit chipset using quantum annealing (a general method for finding the global minimum of a function by a process using quantum fluctuations) to solve optimization problems. The D-Wave One was built on early prototypes such as D-Wave's Orion Quantum Computer. The prototype was a 16-qubit quantum annealing processor, demonstrated on February 13, 2007, at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. D-Wave demonstrated what they claimed to be a 28-qubit quantum annealing processor on November 12, 2007. The chip was fabricated at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Microdevices Lab in Pasadena, California.In May 2013, a collaboration between NASA, Google and the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) launched a Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab based on the D-Wave Two 512-qubit quantum computer that would be used for research into machine learning, among other fields of study.On August 20, 2015, D-Wave Systems announced the general availability of the D-Wave 2X system, a 1000+ qubit quantum computer. This was followed by an announcement on September 28, 2015, that it had been installed at the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab at NASA Ames Research Center.
In January 2017, D-Wave released the D-Wave 2000Q and an open source repository containing software tools for quantum annealers. It contains Qbsolv, which is a piece of open-source software that solves QUBO problems on both company's quantum processors and classic hardware architectures.
D-Wave operated from various locations in Vancouver, British Columbia, and laboratory spaces at UBC before moving to its current location in the neighboring suburb of Burnaby. D-Wave also has offices in Palo Alto and Vienna, USA.


== Computer systems ==

The first commercially produced D-Wave processor was a programmable, superconducting integrated circuit with up to 128 pair-wise coupled superconducting flux qubits. The 128-qubit processor was superseded by a 512-qubit processor in 2013. The processor is designed to implement a special-purpose quantum annealing as opposed to being operated as a universal gate-model quantum computer.
The underlying ideas for the D-Wave approach arose from experimental results in condensed matter physics, and in particular work on quantum annealing in magnets performed by  Gabriel Aeppli, Thomas Felix Rosenbaum and collaborators, who had been checking the advantages, proposed by Bikas K. Chakrabarti & collaborators,  of quantum tunneling/fluctuations in the search for ground state(s) in spin glasses. These ideas were later recast in the language of quantum computation by MIT physicists Edward Farhi, Seth Lloyd, Terry Orlando, and Bill Kaminsky, whose publications in 2000 and 2004 provided both a theoretical model for quantum computation that fit with the earlier work in quantum magnetism (specifically the adiabatic quantum computing model and quantum annealing, its finite temperature variant), and a specific enablement of that idea using superconducting flux qubits which is a close cousin to the designs D-Wave produced. In order to understand the origins of much of the controversy around the D-Wave approach, it is important to note that the origins of the D-Wave approach to quantum computation arose not from the conventional quantum information field, but from experimental condensed matter physics.
D-Wave maintains a list of peer-reviewed technical publications by their own scientists and others on their website.


=== Orion prototype ===
On February 13, 2007, D-Wave demonstrated the Orion system, running three different applications at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. This marked the first public demonstration of, supposedly, a quantum computer and associated service.The first application, an example of pattern matching, performed a search for a similar compound to a known drug within a database of molecules. The next application computed a seating arrangement for an event subject to compatibilities and incompatibilities between guests. The last involved solving a Sudoku puzzle.The processors at the heart of D-Wave's ""Orion quantum computing system"" are designed for use as hardware accelerator processors rather than general-purpose computer microprocessors. The system is designed to solve a particular NP-complete problem related to the two dimensional Ising model in a magnetic field. D-Wave terms the device a 16-qubit superconducting adiabatic quantum computer processor.According to the company, a conventional front end running an application that requires the solution of an NP-complete problem, such as pattern matching, passes the problem to the Orion system.
According to Geordie Rose, founder and Chief Technology Officer of D-Wave, NP-complete problems ""are probably not exactly solvable, no matter how big, fast or advanced computers get""; the adiabatic quantum computer used by the Orion system is intended to quickly compute an approximate solution.


==== 2009 Google demonstration ====
On December 8, 2009, at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference, a Google research team led by Hartmut Neven used D-Wave's processor to train a binary image classifier.


=== D-Wave One ===
On May 11, 2011, D-Wave Systems announced the D-Wave One, an integrated quantum computer system running on a 128-qubit processor. The processor used in the D-Wave One, code-named ""Rainier,"" performs a single mathematical operation, discrete optimization. Rainier uses quantum annealing to solve optimization problems. The D-Wave One was claimed to be the world's first commercially available quantum computer system. Its price was quoted at approximately US$10,000,000.A research team led by Matthias Troyer and Daniel Lidar found that, while there is evidence of quantum annealing in D-Wave One, they saw no speed increase compared to classical computers. They implemented an optimized classical algorithm to solve the same particular problem as the D-Wave One.


==== Lockheed Martin and D-Wave collaboration ====
On May 25, 2011, Lockheed Martin signed a multi-year contract with D-Wave Systems to realize the benefits based upon a quantum annealing processor applied to some of Lockheed's most challenging computation problems. The contract included purchase of the D-Wave One quantum computer, maintenance, and associated professional services.


==== Optimization problem-solving in protein structure determination ====
In August 2012, a team of Harvard University researchers presented results of the largest protein-folding problem solved to date using a quantum computer. The researchers solved instances of a lattice protein folding model, known as the Miyazawa–Jernigan model, on a D-Wave One quantum computer.


=== D-Wave Two ===

In early 2012, D-Wave Systems revealed a 512-qubit quantum computer, code-named Vesuvius, which was launched as a production processor in 2013.In May 2013, Catherine McGeoch, a consultant for D-Wave, published the first comparison of the technology against regular top-end desktop computers running an optimization algorithm. Using a configuration with 439 qubits, the system performed 3,600 times as fast as CPLEX, the best algorithm on the conventional machine, solving problems with 100 or more variables in half a second compared with half an hour. The results are presented at the Computing Frontiers 2013 conference.In March 2013 several groups of researchers at the Adiabatic Quantum Computing workshop at the Institute of Physics in London produced evidence, though only indirect, of quantum entanglement in the D-Wave chips.In May 2013 it was announced that a collaboration between NASA, Google and the USRA launched a Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division at Ames Research Center in California, using a 512-qubit D-Wave Two that would be used for research into machine learning, among other fields of study.


=== D-Wave 2X and D-Wave 2000Q ===
On August 20, 2015, D-Wave released general availability of their D-Wave 2X computer, with 1000 qubits in a Chimera graph architecture (although, due to magnetic offsets and manufacturing variability inherent in the superconductor circuit fabrication, fewer than 1152 qubits are functional and available for use; the exact number of qubits yielded will vary with each specific processor manufactured). This was accompanied by a report comparing speeds with high-end single threaded CPUs. Unlike previous reports, this one explicitly stated that question of quantum speedup was not something they were trying to address, and focused on constant-factor performance gains over classical hardware. For general-purpose problems, a speedup of 15x was reported, but it is worth noting that these classical algorithms benefit efficiently from parallelization—so that the computer would be performing on par with, perhaps, 30 high-end single-threaded cores.
The D-Wave 2X processor is based on a 2048-qubit chip with half of the qubits disabled; these were activated in the D-Wave 2000Q.


=== Pegasus ===
In February 2019 D-Wave announced their next-generation Pegasus quantum processor chip, announcing that it would be ""the world’s most connected commercial quantum system,"" with 15 connections per qubit instead of 6; that the next-generation system would use the Pegasus chip; that it would have more than 5000 qubits and reduced noise; and that it would be available in mid-2020.A description of Pegasus and how it differs from the previous ""Chimera"" architecture has been available to the public.

483,Marpole Bridge,"The Marpole CP Rail Bridge is a partially dismantled crossing over the north arm of the Fraser River, and River Dr., in Metro Vancouver.


== History ==
The Marpole road bridge was a nearby sequence of separate structures dating from 1889. 


=== Early CP operation ===
Once the Vancouver & Lulu Island Railway, controlled by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), completed the rail bridge in May 1902, work trains carried the steel rails over the river to lay track on Lulu Island. The route proceeded due south from the bridge along today's Garden City Rd. and west along Granville Ave., before south on Railway Ave. 
The steel swing span railway bridge linked north Eburne with Richmond, and the then important community, port and canneries at Steveston. Created primarily to serve the canneries, the line was not the anticipated commercial success, because the companies preferred shipping directly by sea. Using steam locomotives, the twice daily Vancouver–Steveston mixed trains began that year, but the CP enthusiasm for electrification indicated a desire to off-load the service.


=== BCER operation ===
In 1905, the British Columbia Electric Railway (BCER) leased and electrified the line, as it later would with a new branch to New Westminster. The respective interurbans operated Vancouver–Marpole (formerly Eburne) (1905–52), Marpole–Steveston (1905–58), and Marpole–New Westminster (1909–56). During the early years, the Steveston tram ran hourly. Freight largely comprised smaller loads of way freight. By 1921, spurs to several customers existed near the northern and southern bridge approaches.Owing to the proximity of several bridges on the Fraser, the unique signal for opening the then called British Columbia Electric Bridge on the North Arm, was four long and two short blasts on the vessel's horn.By the end of passenger service in 1958, freight comprised boxcar loads, such as fish oil, often hauled by electric locomotives, soon to become an all diesel fleet on the removal of the overhead power wire. BC Hydro, the successor (1962) to BCER, changed the route in 1965. At the southern bridge approach, the freight track now paralleled the Fraser westward, at a distance of up to 230 metres (755 ft) from the shoreline, before continuing south to join at the Granville/Railway junction. This catered to the Brighouse Industrial Estate, and the Van Horne Industrial Estate surrounding the foot of the bridge.  That year, bridge maintenance comprised the renewal of four protection piers and work on the southern approach trestle. In 1967, when a barge carrying wood chips struck a steel support, the 32.3-metre (106 ft) swing span collapsed into the river.Abandoned, the original north Richmond route was sold to the municipality. Any remaining track was buried on the raising of arterial roads for flood protection. In decline for decades, Steveston freight handling ceased in the 1970s, which effectively ended all traffic to points west of No. 2 Rd. In 1986, BCER relinquished its lease on the track.


=== Later CP operation ===
In 1992, the railway crossing was lifted during the No. 2 Road Bridge construction.
By this time, apart from those No. 2 Rd–Steveston sections already sold, such as the Lynas Lane city works yard, the remaining track was largely overgrown with dense bramble and 6-metre (20 ft) high birch. A few years later, this track was lifted.

By 2002, the only active spur south of Cambie Rd. was Canadian Firelog beside No. 2 Rd., but Ebco Industries (7851 Alderbridge Way) experienced limited use. By 2007, the two major customer spurs were Univar (River Dr./Van Horne Way), and Fraser River Terminals (opposite on River Dr.). Columbia Foam (9500 Van Horne Way) received infrequent service.In 2006, the city purchased the No. 2 Rd–Capstan Way section, allowing CP use to Gilbert Rd. until 2010, but immediately ended service to Canadian Firelog. In realigning River Rd. and developing the Richmond Olympic Oval site, the track southwest of Hollybridge Way was lifted. That year, the Canada Line Operations and Maintenance Centre site was prepared. This involved the demolition of several warehouses, and the rerouting of CP tracks between the southern approaches for the CP Rail and North Arm SkyTrain bridges.In 2010, the city purchased the Railway Ave. stretch, which opened exclusively as a greenway in 2013, quashing any prospects of restoring light rail.In 2014, the track southwest of the bridge, unused at least since 2010, was lifted along the long curve passing beneath the Canada Line, and for the remainder southwest of the Richmond Marina. That year, a hot and fast fire, possibly started by vandals, destroyed a 100-metre (330 ft) section of the creosote-treated wooden trestle approach on the Marpole side. The thick smoke temporarily closed the Oak Street Bridge, and impacted Vancouver International Airport flights. In failing to repair the structure, CP violated its obligations of providing a weekly service to Univar, one of the country’s biggest chemical distributors, isolated by the incident.In 2016, the right-of-way north of Marpole, inactive for over a decade, was sold to become the Arbutus Greenway. After a barge collision that year, CP removed the swing span within days, and its platform in 2017. The track west of the Ontario St. yard appears unused.
