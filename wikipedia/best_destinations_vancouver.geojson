The MOV is the largest civic museum in Canada and the oldest museum in Vancouver. The museum was founded in 1894 and went through a number of iterations before being rebranded as the Museum of Vancouver in 2009.  It creates Vancouver-focused exhibitions and programs that encourage conversations about what was, is, and can be Vancouver.  It shares an entrance and foyer with the H. R. MacMillan Space Centre but the MOV is much larger and occupies the vast majority of the space in the building complex where both organisations sit as well as separate collections storage facilities in another building.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum was founded by the Art, Historical, and Scientific Association of Vancouver (AHSA), which formed on April 17, 1894, with the objective of cultivating \"a taste for the beauties and refinements in life.\" Shortly after its inaugural meeting the AHSA opened its first temporary exhibition ('Paintings and Curiosities') in rented premises on the top floor of the Dunn Building on Granville Street, Vancouver.  This exhibition triggered a series of donations to the new museum's collections which were mostly natural history or ethnographic in origin.  The first recorded donation to the collection was of taxidermy - a stuffed Trumpeter Swan which was donated by Mr Sydney Williams in 1895. Regular purchasing of artefacts for the collections of the AHSA began in 1898 and acquisitions were eclectic and multi-disciplinary reflecting the interests of the decision-makers rather than any strategic approach to collecting.\n\nAs the collection grew the question was raised as to a permanent place to display it and following discussions with the Vancouver City Council agreement was reached on August 26, 1903 that title to the museum collection would pass to the Council in exchange for the provision of suitable and convenient premises where they could be displayed.  It was agreed at the same time that the new museum would be located on the top floor of the new Carnegie Library. The museum opened at this location on April 19, 1905.Between 1915 and 1925 the museum and the AHSA attempted to establish in Stanley Park a reconstructed First Nations village built around a series of major totem and house poles that had been acquired by the AHSA.  This project ultimately failed but it did result in the current display of totem poles in Stanley Park which remain one of the most photographed tourist attractions in Vancouver.In 1930 the museum sponsored an extensive series of archaeological excavations of the Marpole Midden which was one of the most important archaeological sites on the Pacific Northwest Coast but was also an unceded ancestral territory of the Musqueam First Nation and was where the village of c̓əsnaʔəm (Musqueam Marpole Village Site) had been located.  The outcome of this has been dealt with in the award-winning exhibition c̓əsnaʔəm, the city before the city, a joint project between the Musqueam Indian Band, the Museum of Vancouver and the Museum of Anthropology.\nIn 1957 the public library which shared the Carnegie building with the museum moved to a new dedicated building in Burrard Street tripling the available storage and display space for the museum and in 1959 the museum was incorporated into the City Council and became a city department under the control of a Civic Museum Board.  A report was commissioned on the future of the museum (the Heinrich Report of 1965) and this recommended the building of a new museum on the south shore of False Creek near the Burrard Bridge.  Federal and provincial money was made available for the 1967 Confederation Centennial celebrations and the current building was constructed which opened to the public in October 1968. From the opening of the new museum building to 1981, the museum was branded as Centennial Museum; before reverting its name back to Vancouver Museum.\nIn 1972 the city council relinquished its control of the museum and a joint Museum and Planetarium Association was formed as a descendant of the original AHSA which founded the museum. In 1977 the museum was designated a Category A cultural institution by the federal government and named in the Cultural Property Export and Import Act.\nIn 2009, the museum was re-branded as the Museum of Vancouver, in an attempt to reflect its changed focus to Vancouver rather than the lower mainland region of British Columbia as originally set out in its objectives and reaffirmed in 1977.\n\n\n== Building ==\n\nThe building is located at 1100 Chestnut Street in Vanier Park, in the neighbourhood of Kitsilano in Vancouver, BC. The museum is situated at the south end of Vanier Park, with the park acting as a connecting greenspace between the Vancouver Maritime Museum, Bard on the Beach, the Vancouver Archives, and the Vancouver Academy of Music.\nThe building was constructed in 1967 to a design by the architect Gerald Hamilton who had studied at Leeds University before moving to Vancouver in 1950. Hamilton was a practitioner of the New Formalism school of architecture and its most visible proponent in Vancouver at the time.\nOriginally, the building was planned to only house a museum, but a generous gift by the lumber magnate H.R. MacMillan allowed the architect to incorporate a planetarium into the design. As a result, the distinctive roof was added, designed to reflect the shape of a woven basket hat made by Northwest Coast First Nations people.  This decision has created ongoing confusion over the identity of the building as many people associate it mistakenly as only a planetarium whereas the vast majority of the building space is occupied by the galleries of the Museum of Vancouver and the planetarium part was renamed the H.R. MacMillan Space Centre in the late 1990s.\nThe building was officially dedicated on May 20, 1967 and the ceremony was attended by Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra, who was the granddaughter of Queen Mary and King George V and also a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II.\nAlex Bozikovic remarks that the building closesly resembles the John Nugent Studio designed by Saskatchewan architect Clifford Wiens built six years earlier..  The building is considered iconic by Vancouverites and is one of the most immediately recognisable buildings in Vancouver. It was nicknamed 'the Taj Mahal on the creek' when first built and is characterised by its sweeping conical shape and reflecting pools crossed by curved pedestrian bridges.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nThe museum has a large collection of objects which reflect to a large extent the interests of the donors and of the curators who made decisions on acquisitions over the years in a similar way to many museums that were established in this way.  The collection is nationally significant but much of it remains in storage due to a lack of exhibition space.\nThe collection includes the First Nations and Oriental artefacts that were collected by Mary Lipsett who established along with her husband the Lipsett Indian Museum which opened in a former aquarium in the PNE grounds in 1941.  This collection was said to be the finest in Canada when reported on by the Vancouver Sun in 1948 and Mary Lipsett was well-respected for her positive relationship with the First Nations and was honoured with the Kwawlewith name 'Ha-wini-po-la-o-gua', which means “a matriarch to whom many come for good counsel.”  She donated the entire collection to the then Vancouver Museum and it remains in storage there.\nParticular strengths in the MOV collection include:\n\n\n=== Ethnology ===\nOne of the most significant Pacific Northwest Coast First Nations collections in Canada with assemblages such as:\n\n\n=== Asian antiquities ===\nThese include collections such as:\n\n\n=== Egyptian antiquities ===\nThese include:\n\nAncient Egyptian collection, especially mummified boy (previously nicknamed 'Diana') discovered one mile from the Valley of the Kings near Luxor in 1915.  The mummy wrappings are inscribed \"Penechates, son of Hatres\" and it probably dates  from the 1st to the 3rd century CE\nMummified crocodiles, hawk and cats\nMaterial excavated by Sir Flinders Petrie who was a member of the Vancouver Museum Board in 1934\n\n\n=== History of Vancouver ===\nThese include objects such as:\n\n\n== Galleries ==\n\nThe museum has a number of permanent galleries that cover the entire history of Vancouver in an experience which includes sound and film. In addition to the historical permanent galleries, permanent galleries at the Museum of Vancouver include:\n\nWhile most of these galleries explore the history of Vancouver during its specified time period, the Neon Vancouver gallery features a collection of neon signs that were used in Vancouver from the 1950s to 1970s.Along with its permanent galleries, the Museum of Vancouver typically hosts a number of temporary exhibitions. Three temporary exhibitions are presently held at the museum. The c̓əsnaʔəm, the city before the city exhibition was developed in partnership with the Musqueam Indian Band, with plans to remain at the museum from January 2015 to January 2021. The second exhibition, HAIDA NOW: A Visual Feast of Innovation and Tradition opened at the museum in March 2018, and will continue to be held there until June 2021. The museum's most recent exhibition, Acts of Resistance, opened on February 5, 2020 and runs until December 2020.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMuseum of Vancouver official website", "images": [ "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f9\/CarnegieCtr.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/98\/Museum_of_Vancouver.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/d0\/Museum_of_Vancouver_back.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/5f\/Museum_of_Vancouver_neon_exhibit.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/4\/4a\/Commons-logo.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/4\/48\/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg" ], "lat": 49.27611111, "lng": -123.14388889 }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -123.1447262, 49.2762376 ], [ -123.1449286, 49.2761791 ], [ -123.1449563, 49.2762175 ], [ -123.1450052, 49.2762025 ], [ -123.1450298, 49.2762366 ], [ -123.1450942, 49.2762169 ], [ -123.145204, 49.2763693 ], [ -123.1451406, 49.2763887 ], [ -123.1451628, 49.2764195 ], [ -123.1451116, 49.2764352 ], [ -123.1451438, 49.2764799 ], [ -123.1449153, 49.2765499 ], [ -123.1448862, 49.2765096 ], [ -123.1448352, 49.2765253 ], [ -123.1448117, 49.2764927 ], [ -123.1447577, 49.2765093 ], [ -123.1448124, 49.2765852 ], [ -123.1446103, 49.2766472 ], [ -123.1445543, 49.2765695 ], [ -123.1444954, 49.2765875 ], [ -123.1445183, 49.2766193 ], [ -123.1444707, 49.2766339 ], [ -123.1445045, 49.2766809 ], [ -123.1442704, 49.2767527 ], [ -123.1442394, 49.2767096 ], [ -123.1441824, 49.2767271 ], [ -123.1441566, 49.2766914 ], [ -123.1440999, 49.2767088 ], [ -123.1439911, 49.2765577 ], [ -123.1440462, 49.2765408 ], [ -123.1440189, 49.2765029 ], [ -123.1440762, 49.2764853 ], [ -123.1440509, 49.2764502 ], [ -123.1441175, 49.2764299 ], [ -123.1440288, 49.2763068 ], [ -123.143962, 49.2763273 ], [ -123.1439314, 49.2762849 ], [ -123.1438847, 49.2762992 ], [ -123.1438623, 49.2762681 ], [ -123.1437956, 49.2762886 ], [ -123.1436853, 49.2761355 ], [ -123.143741, 49.2761184 ], [ -123.1437175, 49.2760859 ], [ -123.1437731, 49.2760688 ], [ -123.1437454, 49.2760303 ], [ -123.1438245, 49.2760061 ], [ -123.1439801, 49.2759583 ], [ -123.1440089, 49.2759982 ], [ -123.144054, 49.2759844 ], [ -123.1440762, 49.2760152 ], [ -123.144122, 49.2760011 ], [ -123.144218, 49.2761344 ], [ -123.1442418, 49.2761108 ], [ -123.1443409, 49.2760722 ], [ -123.1444552, 49.2760615 ], [ -123.144567, 49.2760804 ], [ -123.1446589, 49.2761259 ], [ -123.1447169, 49.2761911 ], [ -123.1447262, 49.2762376 ] ], [ [ -123.1444262, 49.2766001 ], [ -123.144226, 49.2766615 ], [ -123.1441313, 49.27653 ], [ -123.1443314, 49.2764686 ], [ -123.1444262, 49.2766001 ] ] ] } },

In 2013, VPL had more than 6.9 million visits with patrons borrowing nearly 9.5 million items including: books, ebooks, CDs, DVDs, newspapers and magazines. Across 22 locations and online, VPL serves nearly 428,000 active members and is the third-largest public library system in Canada.\n\n\n== Services ==\nThe Vancouver Public Library includes a large collection of books and digital content. The library provides community information, programs for children, youth, and adults, and delivery to homebound individuals. In addition, the library also provides access to information and reference services, text databases, interlibrary loan services.\n\n\n=== One Book, One Vancouver ===\nOne Book, One Vancouver was a citywide book club sponsored by the Vancouver Public Library. Titles were selected by the library staff, who voted on one of four titles presented by the One Book, One Vancouver Organizing Committee. It was discontinued after 2010.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn January 1869, the manager of the Hastings Mill, J.A. Raymur, started the New London Mechanics Institute, a meeting room and library for mill employees. In March 1869, it was renamed the Hastings Literary Institute, in honour of Rear Admiral the Honourable George Fowler Hastings. No official records of the Hastings Literary Institute have survived, but it is known that membership was by subscription.  The Hastings Literary Institute continued to exist until the Granville area was incorporated as part of the new City of Vancouver on April 6, 1886.\nFollowing the Great Vancouver Fire on June 13, 1886, 400 books from the now-defunct Hastings Literary Institute were donated to the newly established Vancouver Reading Room. In December 1887, the Reading Room opened at 144 West Cordova Street, above the Thomas Dunn and Company hardware store. It was also known as the Vancouver Free Library and the Vancouver Free Reading Room and Library.\nBy the late 1890s, the Free Reading Room and Library in the YMCA Building on West Hastings had become overcrowded. During this period, the American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie was giving money to cities and towns to build libraries. In 1901, the City of Vancouver approached Carnegie about donating money for a new library to replace the space in the YMCA Building.\n\nIn 1901, American steel magnate, Andrew Carnegie agreed to donate $50,000 to build a city library if Vancouver would provide free land and $5,000 annually to support its operation. A fight immediately developed between East and West side Vancouver as to who would get the new cultural institution. A public plebiscite fixed the site at Hastings and Westminster (now Main) Streets, next door to the first City Hall. The cornerstone was laid by the Grand Lodge of the Masonic Order on March 29, 1902 and under it were placed Masonic documents, a copy of the City’s Act of Incorporation, lists of various officials and examples of the postage stamps and coins then in use. The building was designed by Vancouver architect George Grant and is in the style of Romanesque Renaissance, with a domed Ionic portico and French mansard roof. Granite for the foundation came from Indian Arm and sandstone for the 10\" thick walls came from Gabriola Island. A fantastic marble, spiral staircase was built by Albion Iron Works of Victoria. It cost $2.279 million and 9,888 pounds of steel and iron were used. A large multi-panel stained glass window with 3 smaller windows below was designed and crafted by N.T. Lyon of Toronto. Depicted in the windows are John Milton, William Shakespeare, Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott, Sir Thomas More, and Edmund Spenser. The 3 small windows were removed in 1958 when the library was converted into the museum. They were missing for many years but were located intact and returned to the building in 1985. Inside was hardwood panelled walls and ceilings and oak floors. The rooms were heated by eight fireplaces. There were special reading rooms for ladies and for children, a chess room, newspaper reading room, picture gallery, lecture hall, and on the third floor the Art, Historical and Scientific Association (now called the Vancouver Museum). The library opened in November 1903. This branch is now primarily used as a community centre for residents of the Downtown East Side neighbourhood.\n\nThe Vancouver Public Library continued to occupy the Hastings and Main site until the opening of a new central library at 750 Burrard Street in 1957. The move from the Carnegie site to the new location at 750 Burrard began in mid-October 1957, and the official opening of the new library was held on November 1, 1957. The library remained at the Burrard building until April 22, 1995, when it closed in preparation for the move to a new location at Library Square (350 West Georgia Street). The central branch opened in Downtown Vancouver on May 26, 1995 and cost CAD $106.8 million to build.\nIn September, 2009, the library cancelled a room booking made by the group Exit International to hold a workshop by Dr. Philip Nitschke about assisted suicide. The cancellation came despite months of negotiation between Exit and library administration. The library stated that it had received a legal opinion stating the workshop as described could contravene Canada's Criminal Code, but would not make the opinion public. The workshop was held at Vancouver's Unitarian Church. \"Whatever the reasons of the library were, it's obviously not affecting the decision by the Unitarian Church,\" Dr. Nitschke said. David Eby, executive director of the BC Civil Liberties Association, which failed to get the ban lifted, said \"Usually, librarians are our closest allies in this free-speech debate.\"\n\n\n=== Librarians ===\nGeorge Pollay (1887-1890)\nJames Edwin Machin (1892-1910)\nA. E. Goodman (1910)\nRobert Waite Douglas, City Librarian (1911-1924)\nEdgar Stewart Robinson, Director (1924-1957)\nPeter Grossman, Director (1961-1969)\nMorton P. Jordan, Director (1970-1978)\nG. C.

Sixteen years later, in 1943, the second branch, Kerrisdale (Forty-second Avenue and West Boulevard), came into service. Other branches followed throughout the years, with the last branch, the Terry Salman Branch, opening in 2011. The Strathcona Branch, which shared its collection and facilities with Lord Strathcona Elementary School, was removed from the system in 2016, pending the opening of the nə́c̓aʔmat ct Strathcona Branch in same community in 2017.\n\nThe Vancouver Public Library system now consists of 22 branches situated throughout the city.  Since 2013, all branches are open at least Tuesday through Sunday. The administration centre, and also the largest branch, known as the Central Branch, is located at Library Square in downtown Vancouver.\nThe oldest existing branch, the Kitsilano branch, is the regional reference library for the North Area division of the Libraries. The largest non-Central branch in terms of volumes held, is the Renfrew Branch, with 325,000 volumes.  The Renfrew Branch is listed as having the largest square footage, at 16,000 square feet, while the Kensington branch at 7,100 square feet is one of the larger branch libraries.The approximate number of volumes in each VPL branch are:\n\n\n=== Central branch ===\n\nConsolidating Vancouver Public Library's Central Branch, Federal Office Tower, and retail and service facilities, the Library Square occupies a city block in Downtown Vancouver. Centred on the block, the library is a nine-story rectangular box containing book stacks and services, surrounded by a free-standing, elliptical, colonnaded wall featuring reading and study areas that are accessed by bridges spanning skylit light wells. The building is located in the eastern portion of the Vancouver Central Business District. The address of the library is 350 West Georgia Street, and the Federal office tower is addressed at 300 West Georgia Street. Levels 8 and 9 were previously leased to the Provincial government. Their address was 360 West Georgia Street.\nVPL Central branch internal glass facade overlooks an enclosed concourse formed by a second elliptical wall that defines the east side of the site. This glass-roofed concourse serves as an entry foyer to the library and the more lively pedestrian activities at ground level. Public spaces surrounding the library form a continuous piazza with parking located below grade. The building's exterior resembles the current appearance of the Colosseum in Rome.\n\nAdjacent to the Central Branch is Library Square, a public square is bordered by Robson Street, Homer Street, West Georgia Street, and Hamilton Street. Across West Georgia Street is Canada Post. Across Hamilton Street is the CBC Regional Broadcast Centre Vancouver. Across Homer street is The Centre in Vancouver for the Performing Arts, (formerly The Ford Centre for the Performing Arts) also designed by Moshe Safdie as a complementary building to library square. The Library Square Project was the largest capital project ever undertaken by the City of Vancouver. The decision to build the project came after a favourable public referendum in November 1990. The City then held a design competition to choose a design for the new building. The design by Moshe Safdie  and DA Architects was by far the most radical design and yet was the public favourite. 70% of the public liked the Safdie scheme as a \"unique, imaginative, exciting, interesting building.\" The inclusion of the 21 story office tower in the design was required in order to pay for it and as part of a deal with the federal government to obtain the land; the federal government has a long term lease on the high rise office tower portion of the project. Construction began in early 1993 and was completed in 1995. In the year following the new library's opening, library visitors increased by 800,000.In addition to its function as the central branch of the city's public library system, the one square block project includes an attached office high-rise, retail shops, restaurants, and underground public parking. The Library building has a rooftop garden designed by Vancouver landscape architect Cornelia Oberlander. The roof garden is accessible by the public. The new 8,000-sq-ft rooftop garden and the expansion to Level 9 were built at a cost of $15.5 million; they opened to the public in September, 2018. The expansion is LEED Gold CIv1 certified, managed by Light House Sustainable Building Centre\n\n\n==== Access ====\nThere are local bus routes that pass near Library Square including the #'s 5, 17, and 20. and North Shore routes on Georgia Street.

In addition to being a major tourist attraction for Vancouver, the aquarium is a centre for marine research, ocean literacy education, conservation and marine animal rehabilitation.\nThe Vancouver Aquarium was one of the first facilities to incorporate professional naturalists into the galleries to interpret animal behaviours.\nPrior to this, at the London Zoo Fish House, naturalists James S. Bowerbank, Ray Lankester, David W. Mitchell and Philip H. Gosse (the creator of the word aquarium) had regularly held \"open house\" events, but the Vancouver Aquarium was the first to employ educational naturalists on a full-time basis. Aquarium research projects extend worldwide, and include marine mammal rescue and rehabilitation.\nOn August 9, 2010 Prime Minister Stephen Harper and B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell announced capital funding of up to $15 million. The province would donate $10 million in funding over the next three years to help pay for a planned expansion of the 54-year-old facility, Premier Gordon Campbell said.  Harper added that Ottawa would hand over up to $5 million to the aquarium for infrastructure upgrades. The aquarium, however, remains a nonprofit organization. The property is owned by the City of Vancouver and rented to the aquarium for $40,000 a year since 1991 (prior to which it was $1 per year).\nIn October 2009 the Vancouver Aquarium was designated as a Coastal America Learning Center by the US Environmental Protection Agency. As the first Learning Center in Canada, this designation is intended to strengthen the Canadian\/U.S. partnership for protecting and restoring shared ocean resources.On August 31st, 2020, the non-profit announced on Facebook that due to the financial stresses caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it was pausing its public programming for the time being while it engages in strategic planning for the financial sustainability of its future operations.\n\n\n== Aquarium history ==\n\nThe Vancouver Public Aquarium Association was formed in 1950 by UBC fisheries and oceanography professors Murray Newman, Carl Lietze and Wilbert Clemens. After receiving the help of timber baron H.R. MacMillan, alderman and businessman George Cunningham and $100,000 from each of the three levels of government. (City of Vancouver, Province of British Columbia, Federal Government of Canada), it opened on June 15, 1956 with the ribbon being cut by federal Minister of Fisheries James Sinclair. Sinclair's daughter 7-year-old Margaret was also present at the ribbon cutting ceremony (she would later marry Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and give birth to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau).\nOfficially Canada's first public aquarium, the Vancouver Aquarium has become the largest in Canada and one of the five largest in North America. The Vancouver Aquarium was the first aquarium in the world to capture and display an orca. Other whales and dolphins on display included belugas, narwhals and dolphins.\nIn 1975, the Vancouver Aquarium was the first aquarium accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). The aquarium is also accredited by the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA) and in 1987 was designated Canada's Pacific National Aquarium by the Canadian Federal Government.\nOn July 23, 1995, a beluga whale named Qila was born. She was the first beluga to be both conceived and born in a Canadian aquarium. A second calf, Tuvaq, was born on July 30, 2002, but died unexpectedly with no previous sign of illness on July 17, 2005.\nIn 1996, the Vancouver Park Board instituted a municipal bylaw that prevents the Vancouver Aquarium from capturing cetaceans from the wild for display purposes, and only obtain cetaceans from other facilities if they were born in captivity, captured before 1996 or were rescued and deemed un-releasable after this date.\nOn June 15, 2006 Canada Post issued a 51 cent domestic rate stamp to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the aquarium.\nFor many years, the primary attraction for visitors was the orca show. The aquarium was the first to capture and display a killer whale, Moby Doll, in a pen at Burrard Drydocks, for 3 months in 1964. Since then, it was home to Skana, Hyak II, Finna, Bjossa, and three of Bjossa's calves. When Finna died and Bjossa was left without other orca companions, the aquarium attempted to acquire one or more female orcas from other marine parks. However, no suitable companions were found, and Bjossa was moved to SeaWorld, San Diego, in April 2001 where she later died due to a chronic respiratory illness. The aquarium has since moved to emphasize the educational aspects of the displays rather than the public spectacle of the shows. They have also highlighted their research, rescue and rehabilitation efforts.\nThe aquarium has played a significant role in the research of wild orcas in BC. John Ford, a respected researcher who focuses on orca vocalizations, worked there for many years and they still fund a lot of the study. The Wild Killer Whale Adoption Program, which funds research, is also run out of the aquarium.\n\nAfter considerable public discussion and some opposition from an animal rights group, the Vancouver Park Board voted in favour of a proposal to expand the aquarium at a cost of $100 million, funded by the aquarium, private donors, and infrastructure grants. A public consultation process, led by the aquarium and their own consultants, showed 89% of local residents were in favour of the expansion. The proposal will increase the size of the aquarium by 1.5 acres (6,100 m2) and extend its lease by 20 years. Construction was expected to begin in the fall of 2007.Vancouver Aquarium has not kept any orcas in captivity since 2001 and has pledged not to capture wild animals, but to instead rely on captive animals for breeding.\n\n\n=== Temporary closure ===\nOn August 31st, 2020, the Aquarium made public via a Facebook update that it would be temporarily pausing public programming after September 7th. Despite the fact that the summer season was busy upon reopening, the social distancing requirements of being \"COVID-safe\" did not allow for the necessary visitor volume – ticket sales were down 80% and the not-for-profit was not able to cover costs. The organization stated that it would continue providing uninterrupted care to the resident animals while working on strategic planning; namely, how to operate in a way that would be financially sustainable in light of current conditions.\n\n\n== Aquarium facility ==\nThe aquarium covers approximately 9,000 square metres (97,000 sq ft) and has a total 9,500,000 litres (2,100,000 imp gal; 2,500,000 US gal) of water in 166 aquatic displays. There are a number of different galleries, several of which were built at different times throughout the aquarium's history.\n\n\n=== Pacific Canada Pavilion ===\nThis central indoor exhibit consists of a 260,000 litres (57,000 imp gal; 69,000 US gal) tank directly adjacent to the entrance. Fish and invertebrates from the Strait of Georgia are displayed in the exhibit.\n\n\n=== Steller's Bay\/Canada's Arctic ===\nOriginally this gallery included the beluga whales along with several non-living displays. In October 2009, a new exhibit opened here displaying several other arctic species, including fishes and invertebrates, along with expanded non-living exhibits as part of the Canada's Arctic Gallery. In 2016, the two rescued harbour porpoises from the BC Sugar Pool next door, moved to the Canada's Arctic Gallery. Following the deaths of two belugas in 2016, it has been converted into an active Steller sea lion research station called Steller's Bay in collaboration with the University of British Columbia. The exhibit reopened as Steller's Bay on July 1, 2017, while still retaining the Canada's Arctic portion in the underwater gallery. It is home to four female and two male Steller sea lions. In June 2018, a new \"Research Outpost\" Exhibit opened as an addition to Steller's Bay and programs about the aquarium's research and work regarding walruses, northern fur seals, and Steller sea lions occur.\n\n\n=== Penguin Point ===\nInspired by Boulders Beach, this exhibit features African penguins bred by the Species Survival Plan.\n\n\n=== The Wild Coast ===\nThis is an outdoor gallery that includes several pools, home to a Pacific white-sided dolphin and sea otters that are permanently on display here, along with a \"touchpool\" where visitors are able to touch British Columbian invertebrates. Several other species (harbour seals, Steller's sea lions, and a California sea lion) are rotated in to display in this area. When not housed in this gallery, they live in habitats that are either behind the scenes that are not accessible to visitors, Steller's Bay or the Research Outpost exhibits. There are plans to renovate the habitat into a new Canada's Arctic gallery that will house walruses and other arctic species. It is unclear what will happen to Helen, the Pacific white-sided dolphin, when construction starts in fall 2018.\n\n\n=== Treasures of the BC Coast ===\nThis gallery is a series of separate exhibits that simulate the various aquatic environments on the BC coast. Octopuses, rockfish, sea stars, sea urchins, and anemones are among the animals here.\n\n\n=== Tropic Zone ===\nThis gallery contains a large display of tropical fish and other animals, including blacktip reef sharks and a green sea turtle named Schoona.\n\n\n=== Amazon Rainforest ===\nA number of fresh water fish, snakes, caimans, sloths, birds, and other creatures from the Amazon inhabit this gallery.\n\n\n=== Frogs Forever? Gallery ===\nThis gallery is an exhibit focused on the plight of the world's frog population which endeavors to show how people can help protect frogs and other amphibians.  It contains 26 species of amphibians from around the world.\n\n\n=== Canaccord Exploration Gallery ===\nThis gallery is home to jellies, fish, and other animals.  The 4D Theatre and the children's play area known as \"Clownfish Cove\" are here, along with multiple classrooms for school groups, including the wet lab education room, which contains both conventional teaching methods such as computers, tables, and chairs, along with live animals and various artifacts.\n\n\n== Animals at the aquarium ==\n\nThe Vancouver Aquarium currently houses around 300 species of fish, almost 30,000 invertebrates, and 56 species of amphibians and reptiles. They also have around 60 mammals and birds.\nCurrently, the aquarium houses one Pacific white-sided dolphin:\n\nHelen is an approximately 30-year-old female dolphin at the aquarium. She came to the aquarium from the Enoshima Aquarium in Japan, and is also claimed to have been rescued from entanglement in a fishing net. Helen was part of a multi-year and multi-facility research project focusing on metabolic studies while she was at the Enoshima Aquarium, and is part of a pilot project to understand whale echolocation abilities to prevent whales in the future from becoming entangled in fishing nets. She is distinguishable by the fact that her pectoral flippers are partially amputated due to damage from her entanglement. Helen's tankmate Chester the false killer whale joined her at the Wild Coast on Thursday, June 24, 2015. As of November 24, 2017 Helen is the only cetacean left at Vancouver Aquarium after her tank mate Chester died earlier that same day.Past Pacific white-sided dolphins:\n\nLaverne came to Vancouver from SeaWorld San Antonio. She died in 2009 due to a twisted intestine.\nSpinnaker came to Vancouver in 2001 from Japan after getting caught in a fishing net. He died in 2012 due to a prolonged illness.\nHana came to Vancouver with Helen in 2005 from the Enoshima Aquarium in Japan after getting caught in a fixed fishing net. She died in 2015 from gastrointestinal torsion and sepsis following a last attempt to save her life with a \"breakthrough\" surgery.The aquarium used to house a false killer whale:\n\nChester was a young false killer whale that was rescued by the Vancouver Aquarium Marine Mammal Rescue Centre on Chesterman Beach on Vancouver Island in July 2014. In May 2015, Chester was deemed non-releasable by Fisheries and Oceans Canada which based their decision \"on the animal’s age at stranding, his lack of social contact and foraging skills in the wild, and his extensive contact with humans\". Chester was at the Wild Coast habitat along with Helen the Pacific white-wided dolphin. On November 24, 2017 Chester died of a bacterial infection. He was approximately 3 and a half years old.\nUntil 2016, the aquarium also housed two beluga whales. Qila was born in captivity, whereas Aurora was captured from the wild in waters near Churchill, Manitoba in 1990.\nAurora was a female beluga, who gave birth first to Qila, Tuvaq (who died in 2005) and Nala, who died on June 21 at around 10:15 pm due to coins and foreign matter found in her respiratory tract. \"Aurora\" is named after the famous northern light Aurora borealis. Aurora died on November 25, 2016 at around 30 years of age, and was the last remaining beluga at the aquarium.\nQila was a female beluga born at the aquarium to mother Aurora and father Nanuq on July 23, 1995 (21 years old). She is the first beluga to be conceived and born in a Canadian aquarium, and is also the first beluga conceived and born in a Canadian aquarium to give birth to a calf. \"Qila\" derives from the Inuktitut word qilalugaq qualuqtaq, which means \"beluga\". She gave birth to her first calf Tiqa, who died of heart failure and pneumonia on September 16, 2011. Qila died on November 16, 2016.Both belugas lived in the Canada's Arctic enclosure (Now Steller's Bay).\nOn breeding loan to SeaWorld, Shedd Aquarium & Georgia Aquarium are the following:\n\nAllua, a female beluga is around 24 years of age. She was moved to SeaWorld San Diego on a breeding loan in 2005.\nImaq, a male beluga who is around 21 years of age. He is on breeding loan to SeaWorld San Antonio. Currently he is at the Georgia Aquarium.\nGrayson, a  male beluga who is 8 years old living at the Shedd Aquarium. He was born at SeaWorld San Antonio in 2007, but belongs to the Vancouver Aquarium as he was born to Nanuq, who was owned by the aquarium and also fathered Qila. Until early 2016, Grayson was living at the Georgia Aquarium with his half-sister Qinu.\nQinu, a female beluga born in 2010 who is 7 years of age living at the Georgia Aquarium. She was also born at SeaWorld San Antonio and lived with Grayson until he was moved to the Shedd Aquarium. As with Grayson, she was born to Nanuq and belongs to the Vancouver Aquarium.Past belugas:\n\nKavna was estimated to be around 46 years of age at the time of her death on August 6, 2012. Cancerous lesions found on her reproductive tract may have contributed to her death. She was distinguishable from the other belugas by the fact that she was the whitest, due to her age.\nNanuq, was around 31 years of age at the time of his death in 2015. Nanuq was Qila's father and was on breeding loan to SeaWorld since July 1997 when he died of a jaw infection.\nTuaq was born to Kavna and an unknown wild beluga in 1977 but died 4 months later due to malnutrition and a bacterial infection.\nTuvaq was born to Aurora and Imaq in 2002 but died unexpectedly in 2005 from a heart arrhythmia.\nNala was also born to Aurora and Imaq in 2009 but died a year after due to foreign objects found inside her respiratory tract.\nTiqa was born in 2008 to Qila and Imaq and was the first 3rd generation beluga to be born at the aquarium. Tiqa's name stands for T-Tuesday, I-Imaq, Q-Qila and A-Aurora.  She died in 2011 due to pneumonia and heart failure.The Vancouver Aquarium used to house two Pacific harbour porpoise rescued by the aquarium's Marine Mammal Rescue Centre. Daisy was rescued from Gonzolez Beach, B.C. in 2008, and after receiving almost a year of veterinary care and being deemed nonreleasable, was transferred to the Vancouver Aquarium on July 29, 2009. Daisy died on June 16,\n2017 \nAnother Pacific harbour porpoise, Jack, was rescued from Horseshoe Bay, B.C. in September 2011 and transferred to the aquarium on March 15, 2012. Jack died in August 2016.\nThe aquarium is home to Seven sea otters:\n\nKatmai is a young female sea otter recently rescued near Homer, Alaska by the Alaska SeaLife Center on October 17, 2012, when she was only a few weeks old. Shortly thereafter, the Alaska SeaLife Center invited a rotating team of Vancouver Aquarium specialists to help provide intensive 24-hour care and rehabilitation for the pup over the next 17 weeks. After being deemed non-releasable by the U.S. Fisheries and Wildlife Service, she arrived at the Vancouver Aquarium on March 21, 2013. After an online naming contest, on April 2, 2013, the aquarium announced that the pup would be named Katmai after a national park in Alaska.\nRialto is a male pup that was found abandoned at Rialto Beach in Washington state's Olympic National Park by the Seattle Aquarium.  As U.S. Fisheries and Wildlife Services deemed him non-releasable and the Seattle Aquarium did not have space to accommodate another male sea otter, the decision was made to transfer him to the Vancouver Aquarium after he had recovered.  Rialto was permanently moved to Vancouver in September 2016.\nMak is a male sea otter pup who was transported to the aquarium from Alaska in November 2016 with Kunik.  Both were treated at the Alaska SeaLife Center and deemed non-releasable by the U.S. Fisheries and Wildlife Services.  Mak was found stranded in Kachemak Bay, Alaska by a member of the public.  His name derives from his rescue site.\nKunik is a female sea otter pup who was transferred to the aquarium with Mak in November 2016 after both were treated at Alaska SeaLife Center and deemed non-releasable by the U.S. Fisheries and Wildlife Services.  She found by the U.S. Coast Guard stranded on Homer Spit, Alaska, and her name is an Inuktitut word for a traditional Inuit greeting, or \"kiss.\"\nHardy is a male sea otter pup who was rescued in June 2017 at Port Hardy, is the only Canadian sea otter at the aquarium.\nTazlina is a female sea otter pup who was rescued by some fishermen trawling for salmon at Alaska’s Anchor Point in April 2019. She was only a day old when she found by the fisherman, and she got sent to Alaska SeaLife Center by some volunteer. After taking care by the animal trainer from aquarium, she moved to the aquarium in September 2019.\nJoey is a male sea otter rescued near Kyuquot, B.C. on July 2nd, 2020. He was about 10 days old and presumed the deceased, adult otter nearby was the mother.  Joey was rescued and transported to the Marine Mammal rescue Centre for treatment. Now, Joey remain at the Aquarium, with a 24 hour live stream of his recovery.  Currently, Joey has been deemed non-releasable and will remain with Vancouver Aquarium. Past otters:\n\nTanu is an adult female who was abandoned as a pup, rescued by the Alaska SeaLife Center and later moved to the aquarium.\nNyac was a female sea otter rescued from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.  She was one of the last surviving sea otters from the incident and was later featured in a viral YouTube video of sea otters \"holding hands\" recorded by Cynthia Holmes.  Nyac died on September 23, 2008 at approximately 20 years of age.  Days before her death, she was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which has been associated with contact with petroleum in other marine species.\nMilo was a male sea otter rescued and brought to the aquarium after being deemed non-releasable.  Along with Nyac, he was featured in the viral YouTube video of sea otters \"holding hands\" by Cynthia Holmes.  Milo died on January 12, 2012 at the age of 12 years after being diagnosed with lymphoma.  He was the first otter to be treated with chemotherapy as part of a unique chemotherapeutic treatment plan developed by researchers, veterinarians, and pathologists around the world.\nWalter\/Wally was found as an injured adult sea otter in Tofino, on the West Coast of Vancouver Island. He had been shot by a shotgun and suffered extensive injuries as a result. After receiving critical care at the Marine Mammal Rescue Centre he became a healthy sea otter who would not survive in the ocean and was therefore moved to the aquarium. He was estimated to be over 10 years old at the time of his rescue.  He died on December 9, 2015.\nElfin is an adult male sea otter who was abandoned as a pup, was rescued by the Alaska SeaLife Center and later moved to the aquarium. Elfin died peacefully on April 1, 2017, at the age of 16. Elfin was distinctively known for his large amount of white fur.\nThe aquarium is also home to two harbor seals at this time, all of which are male (Jessica Seal, DaVinci, and Hermes). Jessica Seal was rescued from Kitsilano Beach in 2019 after being discovered to have been shot in the head by birdshot and blinded as a result.\nThe aquarium also houses 6 northern fur seals (Meechi, Tikva, Tuku, Kyoo, Aya, and Ani), and seven Steller sea lions (Amak, Kenai, Willo, Ashby, Rogue, Bella Bella, and Izzy). Some of the sea lions actually belong to the University of British Columbia, and are part of a research program aimed at studying the causes for the collapse of the Steller sea lion population in Alaska, while Bella Bella is housed at the aquarium after being rescued as a pup on McInnes Island in June 2017 and being deemed non-releasable. Amak and Kenai are half-siblings who were both born at Ocean Park Hong Kong in 2010 and lived at a Japanese facility before being transferred to the Vancouver Aquarium in May 2017.\nThe aquarium also currently houses an adult male California sea lion (Señor Cinco) who was found with gunshot wounds on Vancouver's Spanish Banks on May 5, 2017, and blinded as a result. He is their first California sea lion on display and currently lives in the BC Sugar Pool habitat.\nAt an off-site research facility, an additional 4 Steller sea lions are kept as part of an open-water research program. They are Hazy, Sitka, Boni, and Yasha.\nOn July 1, 2008, Tag, a 15-year-old male sea lion, died due to oral cancer, despite receiving laser surgery and chemotherapy. Tag was a 15-year-old male sea lion who arrived at the aquarium as a 2-week-old pup.The aquarium has one green sea turtle (Schoona). Schoona is a 16-year-old sea turtle, who has arrived at the aquarium in 2005.\nGiselle is a zebra shark who arrived at the Vancouver Aquarium around 2008. Giselle is around 15 years old.\n\n\n== Mammals at the aquarium ==\n\n\n== Vancouver Aquarium Amazon Gallery ==\n\n\n== Frogs Forever? ==\n\n\n== Conservation and research programs ==\nThe Vancouver Aquarium has created and operates a number of conservation and research programs aimed at understanding and preserving animal species in the wild.\n\n\n=== Ocean Wise Seafood ===\nThe Vancouver Aquarium has a program called Ocean Wise Seafood, which is aimed at promoting sustainable seafood in restaurants, markets, and other food service facilities. Its main thrust is to avoid species whose fishing typically causes large bycatches, species from areas where the habitat will degrade if overfished, and species which themselves are overfished. Ocean Wise works directly with food service companies to select sustainable seafood and actively promote them to the general public. The options are highlighted on participating restaurant menus and display cases with the Ocean Wise symbol, to help consumers make environmentally friendly seafood choices. Today, well over 700 restaurants and food stores in Canada are participants in the Ocean Wise sustainable seafood program.\n\n\n=== Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup ===\nThe Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup is a program that was initiated by the Vancouver Aquarium by a small group of staff members and volunteers in 1994. These employees had heard about the International Coastal Cleanup and decided to participate in it by picking up garbage at a local beach and submitting the information. The Ocean Conservancy's International Coastal Cleanup is an annual international initiative aimed to engage people to remove trash and debris from the world's beaches and waterways, identify the sources of debris, and change the behaviors that cause marine debris in the first place.\nVolunteers and sponsors collect and catalogue debris which is then collected for analysis on sources of garbage that enter the ocean. For example, in 2007, 1,240 beach sites with a collective length of 1,772 km were cleaned by 52,263 volunteers bringing in almost 87.5 metric tons of garbage.\n\n\n=== Marine Mammal Rescue and Rehabilitation Program ===\nThe Vancouver Aquarium operates a Marine Mammal Rescue program which is aimed at rescuing and rehabilitating marine mammals that are found injured, ill, or abandoned, until they can be re-released into their natural habitats. On average, the Rescue Centre admits approximately 100 distressed marine mammals per year. The vast majority of these are harbour seals, but patients can include sea otters, elephant seals, Steller sea lions, harbour porpoises, and common dolphins. The program notably helped rescue Springer, an orphaned killer whale successfully released and reunited with her family pod. Other high-profile rescues include the successful returning of a beached grey whale back to the water in 2005 and the rescue of Schoona, a lost green sea turtle near Prince Rupert, BC. In October 2013, rescued harbour porpoise Levi became the first cetacean to be rehabilitated at the Marine Mammal Rescue Centre and released back into the wild.\n\n\n=== B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network ===\nThe B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network is a collaborative conservation and research program between the Vancouver Aquarium and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada aimed at collecting reports and sightings of whales and sea turtles in the wild. The Sightings Network is a network of over 1,800 observers across British Columbia, including whale watching operators, lighthouse keepers, charter boat operators, tugboat captains, BC Ferries personnel, researchers, government employees, recreational boaters and coastal residents. The program aims to solicit reports through the program's website, a toll-free hotline, email, or through the logbook program.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn 2014, the Vancouver Aquarium's practice of keeping whales, dolphins and porpoises in captivity and its beluga whale breeding program sparked controversy.\nIn March 2014, two Park Board Commissioners, Sarah Blyth and Constance Barnes, publicly spoke out against the practice of keeping whales and dolphins in captivity at the aquarium. Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson, in an emailed letter to The Georgia Straight, expressed his personal belief that \"the Vancouver Aquarium should begin to phase out the holding of whales and dolphins in captivity\". Primatologist and ethologist Jane Goodall called for the Park Board to follow through with the proposed \"phase out\" of cetaceans and end the Vancouver Aquarium's captive breeding program.The Vancouver Aquarium responded to criticism with an open letter in which they explained that it was their policy not to capture cetaceans from the wild and that the aquarium played a role as a home for rescued cetaceans that cannot be returned to the wild.\nThe Park Board proceeded to commission an independent report from US wildlife veterinarian and scientist Dr. Joseph Gaydos in which he examined the aquarium's animal care standards, accreditation and research and compared it to similar facilities in North America. In his report he found that the Vancouver Aquarium \"either meets or exceeds North American industry standards\". He also concluded that the aquarium had \"an active research department that seems to make good use of studying captive cetaceans, not only for being able to provide better care and understanding of captive animals, but to a greater extent [...] to benefit our understanding and conservation of cetaceans in the wild.\" Dr Gaydos also made two recommendations. He recommended that the Park Board conduct \"a large-scale scientific study on the welfare of captive housed cetaceans\" as a way of assessing \"the complex societal issue of captive cetaceans\". He also suggested that the Park Board require the aquarium to release an annual report on the state of its cetaceans.\nIn the media, the Gaydos report was widely received as a positive review of the aquarium's practices and the Vancouver Aquarium also received support from prominent philanthropists and politicians, as well as four former Vancouver mayors. The Monterey Bay Aquarium and the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California also spoke out in favour of the Vancouver Aquarium's cetacean program, citing its importance for scientific research.After a long public debate that ended with the presentation of the Gaydos report and two days of public hearings, the Vancouver Park Board announced in August 2014 that it intended to enact a by-law to ban breeding of cetaceans at the Vancouver Aquarium, and it tasked its staff with drafting an amendment to the existing by-law regulating cetaceans at the aquarium. Vancouver Aquarium CEO Dr. John Nightingale criticized the decision in a public letter, stating that the decision \"was not based on the facts or science presented\" and that it did not take into consideration \"testimony from dozens of the world’s scientific community, including experts in animal welfare and animal cognition.\".Following a defeat in the elections to Park Board as part of the 2014 civic elections, a majority of the Park Board commissioners, in their last session, voted against enacting an amendment to the by-law.\n\n\n=== Federal law banning captivity of cetaceans ===\nIn 2019, the Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act became law in Canada.  Two facilities would be affected, Marineland of Canada and the Vancouver Aquarium. When passed in June 2019, Marineland was reported to have 61 cetaceans, while the Vancouver Aquarium had just one dolphin remaining. The law has a grandfather clause, permitting those cetaceans already in captivity to remain where they are, but breeding and further acquisition of cetaceans is prohibited, subject to limited exceptions.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Vancouver Aquarium was featured frequently in the 1980s Canadian series, Danger Bay, which followed the day to day exploits of the Roberts family, led by Grant \"Doc\" Roberts, a marine veterinarian and his two children, Nicole and Jonah.\nA YouTube video featuring two sea otters \"holding hands\" was recorded at the Vancouver Aquarium. The two sea otters are Nyac and Milo. Nyac died on September 23, 2008. She was one of the last surviving sea otters of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. The video has been viewed over 19 million times on YouTube. As a result, the Vancouver Aquarium created a live sea otter cam on their website. The YouTube video was originally recorded by Cynthia Holmes. Milo died on January 12, 2012.The Vancouver Aquarium was also featured in the family film Andre (1994), and romantic comedy Good Luck Chuck (2007), as Cam's workplace. Television movie The Suite Life Movie (2011) used the aquarium as the research firm where Cody Martin interns.\nOn September 5, 2008, Hayden Panettiere appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman and talked about her visit with the rescue dolphins at the Vancouver Aquarium.\nThe song \"Baby Beluga\" by Raffi was inspired by Kavna, a beluga that he saw while visiting the Vancouver Aquarium.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\nWaters is a magazine published by Canada Wide Media Limited for the official members of the Vancouver Aquarium.

Situated in downtown Vancouver, the museum occupies a 15,300-square-metre-building (165,000 sq ft) adjacent to Robson Square, making it the largest art museum in Western Canada by building size. Designed by Francis Rattenbury, the building the museum presently occupies was originally opened as a provincial courthouse, before it was re-purposed for museum use in the early 1980s. The building was designated as the Former Vancouver Law Courts National Historic Site of Canada in 1980.\nThe museum was opened to the public in 1931 in a building designed by architectural firm Sharp and Johnston. The museum expanded its first building once in 1950, before plans were undertaken to move the institution to the former provincial courthouse building. The museum was relocated to the provincial courthouse in 1983. Plans were undertaken by the museum in the late 2000s and 2010s to relocate the institution to a new facility in Larwill Park.\nThe Vancouver Art Gallery's permanent collection serves as a repository of art for the Lower Mainland region, and has approximately 12,000 works by artists from Canada, and around the world. In addition to exhibiting works from its collection, the museum has also organized, and hosted a number of travelling arts exhibitions.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn April 1931, the Vancouver Art Gallery Association was established under the provincial Society Act, in order to establish and maintain a museum for the City of Vancouver. The Association opened the art museum to the public at 1145 West Georgia Street on 5 October 1931. The building was designed by architectural firm Sharp and Johnston, and featured four galleries, one of which included a sculpture hall, a lecture hall, and a library. The cost to construct the building was approximately C$40,000.\n \nWorks by British, and other European artists dominated the works exhibited at the museum at the time of its opening. In 1938, the museum was the one of the buildings occupied by unemployed protesters during a sitdown strike in the weeks leading up to Bloody Sunday. No paintings were damaged while the protesters occupied the building.In 1950, the museum conducted renovations to its building, reshaping the design of the building towards an International Style of architecture; with the removal of the building's Art Deco facade. Renovations were also conducted to accommodate the 157 works bequeathed to the museum by Emily Carr, with the building reopened to the public in 1951. Cost for the renovation was approximately C$600,000, funded by the City of Vancouver government, and funds raised by Lawren Harris.In 1983 the museum was relocated to its present location, the former provincial courthouse. The building continues to be owned by the Government of British Columbia, although the museum occupies the building through a 99-year sublease signed with the City of Vancouver government in 1974; who in turn leases the building from the provincial government. Before the re-purposed building was opened to the public, it was renovated by architect Arthur Erickson at a cost of C$20 million, as a part of his larger three city-block Robson Square redevelopment. The gallery connects to the rest of Robson Square via an underground passage below Robson Street.\n\nPlans to build a new building for the museum were undertaken in 2004, a result from its need for more exhibition and storage space for its collections. In November 2007, the museum publicly announced plans to move to seek approval from Vancouver City Council to build a new building at Larwill Park, a block formerly occupied by a bus depot on the corner of Cambie and Georgia streets. However, in May 2008, the museum and the City of Vancouver government announced its intention to relocate to an area occupied by the Plaza of Nations. The Vancouver City Council later reversed its decision in April 2013, opting to approve the original proposed site in Larwill Park. In September 2013, the museum formally issued requests for qualifications to construct the new building, receiving responses from 75 architectural firms from 16 countries. In April 2014, Herzog & de Meuron's bid was selected by the museum. The development of the Vancouver Art Gallery's new building is the first project for the architectural firm in the country. Perkins and Will's Vancouver branch was contracted as the project's executive architects.The cost to construct the building has been estimated to be C$330 million, with the federal and provincial governments expected to provide C$200 million, and the museum expected to raise the rest from public and private donors. Should the museum secure its relocation, the museum would occupy the building under similar arrangements as the former courthouse, with the museum leasing the property from the City of Vancouver. Completion of the building was originally announced to be in 2020 by the architect selection committee in 2014. However, as of September 2019, developments for the new building have stalled due to a funding dispute between the federal and provincial governments.\n\n\n=== Select exhibitions since 2006 ===\n\nThe Vancouver Art Gallery has organized and hosted a number of temporary, and travelling exhibitions. A select list of exhibitions held at the museum since 2005 include:\n\n\n== Building ==\n\nThe art museum is located in the former provincial courthouse for Vancouver. The 15,300-square-metre (165,000 sq ft) neoclassical building was designed by Francis Rattenbury after winning a design competition in 1905. The building was opened as a provincial courthouse in 1911, and operated as such until 1979, with the provincial courts moved to the Law Courts, located south of the building. The building was designated the Former Vancouver Law Courts National Historic Site of Canada in 1980. Both the main and annex portions of the building are also designated \"A\" heritage structures by the municipal government. The Vancouver Art Gallery moved into the former courthouse in 1983.The Centennial Fountain on the Georgia Street side of the building was installed in 1966 to commemorate the centennial of the union of the colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia; although it was later removed in 2017 as part of the Georgia Street plaza renovations. Shortly after the provincial courts moved out of the building, the building was renovated for museum use, and as a part of Arthur Erickson's redevelopment of Robson Square. The Annex Building is the only part of the building complex that was not converted for museum use.\nThe design of the building includes ionic columns, a central dome, formal porticos, and ornate stonework. The building was constructed using marble imported from Alaska, Tennessee, and Vermont. Construction for the building began in 1906 and replaced the previous courthouse located at Victory Square. At the time, the building contained 18 courtrooms. An annex designed by Thomas Hooper was added to the western side of the building in 1912. It was declared a heritage site and retains the original judges' benches and walls as they were when the building was a courthouse.\n\n\n=== Gathering place ===\nThe front lawn and steps of the building has hosted a number of public gatherings and protests. The building serves as the monthly meeting spot for Vancouver's Critical Mass, as well as flash mobs, the Zombie Walk, pro-marijuana rallies, and numerous environmental demonstrations. The steps on both the Robson Street and Georgia Street sides of the building are popular gathering spots for protest rallies. The Georgia Street side is also a popular place in the summertime for people to relax or socialize.\nIn March 2007, the 2010 Olympic countdown clock was placed in the front lawn of the building. It was open for free for the public to see. The clock has since been disassembled, with one half going to BC Place and the other to Whistler Village.\n\n\n== Permanent collection ==\n\nAs of December 2018, the Vancouver Art Gallery's permanent collection had approximately 12,000 works by Canadian, and international artists. The museum's permanent collection is formally owned by the City of Vancouver, with the museum acting as the custodians for the collection under a lease and license agreement. The permanent collection acts as the principal repository of works produced in the Lower Mainland region, with museum acquisitions typically focused on historical and contemporary art from the region. Approximately half of the works in its collection were produced by artists from Western Canada. In addition to art from the region, the collection also has a focus on First Nations art, and art from Asia. The museum's collection is organized into several smaller areas, contemporary art from Asia, photography and conceptual photography, works by indigenous Canadian artists from the region, and artists from Vancouver and British Columbia.The museum's photography and conceptual art collection includes photographs from the 1950s to the present, and includes photos by the N.E. Thing Co. artist collective, photographers of the Vancouver School of conceptual photography, and other artists including Dan Graham, Andreas Gursky, Thomas Ruff, Cindy Sherman, Robert Smithson, and Thomas Struth. The museum's collection of contemporary Asian art includes works by Eikoh Hosoe, Mariko Mori, Fiona Tan, Jin-me Yoon, Reena Saini Kallat, Song Dong, Wang Du, Wang Jianwei, Yang Fudong, and O Zhang.\n\n\n=== Canadian art ===\n\nServing as a repository for art for the region, the museum holds a number of works by artists based in the Lower Mainland, in addition to artists based in other regions of British Columbia. The museum's collection includes works from Canadian artists, including members of the Group of Seven, Gathie Falk, Michael Snow, and Joyce Wieland. The museum's collection also features a significant number of works by Emily Carr, dating from 1913 to 1942. The painting Totem Poles, Kitseukla, by Carr, was among the original set of works acquired for the museum's collection prior to opening in 1931. The permanent collections of the Vancouver Art Gallery, along with the collections of the National Gallery of Canada, hold the largest number of works by Carr of any collection in the world.The museum's also features a collection of indigenous Canadian art from the region, including works from Haida, Heiltsuk, Inuit, Kwakwakaʼwakw, Nuu-chah-nulth, Nuxalk, and Tlingit artists. Regular acquisitions of indigenous Canadian works was undertaken by the museum beginning in the 1980s; with the museum's practices prior to the 1980s typically leaving the acquisition of indigenous Canadian works for the collections of ethnographic, or history museums.In 2015, George Gund III bequeathed to the museum 37 First Nations works, including totem poles by Ken Mowatt and Norman Tait, drawings by Bill Reid, and thirteen carved works by Robert Davidson. Other works in the museum's indigenous Canadian collection includes works by Sonny Assu, Rebecca Belmore, Dempsey Bob, Dana Claxton, Joe David, Reg Davidson, Beau Dick, Brian Jungen, Marianne Nicolson, and Lawrence Paul Yuxweluptun.\n\n\n=== Selected works ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Library and archive ==\nThe Vancouver Art Gallery Library and Archives is a non-circulating library that specializing in modern, contemporary and Canadian art.

The 62-storey Shangri-La tower contains a 5-star hotel and its offices on the first 15 floors, with condominium apartment units occupying the rest of the tower. The building's podium complex also includes a spa, Urban Fare specialty grocery store, a Vancouver Art Gallery public display, and a curated public sculpture garden. The high-rise stands 200.86 metres (659 ft) tall and there is a private roof garden on floor 61. It is the 7th tallest building in Canada.\nAs part of the development deal, the Coastal Church, built in 1919 and located at the west end of the site, underwent a $4.4 million restoration.\n\n\n== Hotel ==\nThe Shangri-La Hotel Vancouver is a full-service hotel that is part of the building. It is a member of the Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts chain, and is Shangri-La's first North American property. The hotel occupies floors Ground to 15 with 119 rooms (including a presidential suite on the 15th floor). There is no 4th or 13th floor. The hotel includes 5-star services such as restaurants, shops, and Chi The Spa at Shangri-La.\n\n\n== Residences ==\nLiving Shangri-La also contains 307 residential units, consisting of 234 general live-work homes on floors 16 to 43 and 63 private access residential units on floors 44–60 with three penthouses on floor 61. The condominium units are accessible from the entrance at 1128 West Georgia Street and 1111 Alberni Street.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThe project required 3.1 million man-hours of employment, 15,000 truckloads of earth excavated, 51,000 cubic metres (1,800,000 cu ft) of concrete, and 7,000 metric tons (6,900 long tons; 7,700 short tons) of reinforcing steel. During the height of construction activity, 1,000 workers were on site constructing one floor per week. The Shangri-La set Vancouver's record for the deepest excavation of 26 m (85 ft), defeating the past record of 23 m (75 ft) set by the One Wall Centre, and it officially became the tallest building in Vancouver on October 2, 2007. The total cost of this building was near CA$350 million. The tower crane on top of the building was fitted with Christmas lights on November 13, 2007, and was the tallest crane illuminated in Vancouver in 2007.A windstorm on January 15, 2008, caused loose construction materials to blow off the building and into the streets below.

The museum is affiliated with CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.\n\n\n== Collection ==\n \nThe main exhibit is the St. Roch, a historic arctic exploration vessel used by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The museum also has extensive galleries of model ships, including one with historic model ships built entirely from cardboard or paper as well as a particularly fine bone model of the French warship Vengeur du Peuple which was built around 1800 by French prisoners of war, a Children's Maritime Discovery Centre, a recreation of the forecastle of Vancouver's ship Discovery, an extensive collection of maritime art, and a large library and archives. \nOutdoor displays include the NASA undersea research vessel Ben Franklin and the boiler of the Beaver, the first steamship in the Pacific Northwest; it also has a small heritage harbour. There is a workshop where visitors can watch craftsmen build models. Of particular significance is the extensive Chung collection of material relating to Canadian Pacific steamships and original hand drawn charts from Captain Cook's exploration of the Pacific. This collection is separate from the Wally Chung material housed at the Rare Books and Archives Collection at the University of British Columbia.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMaritime Museum of British Columbia\nMuseum ship\nList of museum ships\nShip replica\nShips preserved in museums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website", "images": [ "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4c\/15_Metro_Vancouver_Regional_District_British_Columbia.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/32\/Ben_franklin_today.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/fc\/Maple_Leaf_%28from_roundel%29.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/d5\/Maritime_museum_st_roch.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/90\/Museum_btn.png", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/0c\/Red_pog.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/b\/b4\/Ambox_important.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/4\/4a\/Commons-logo.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/c\/cf\/Flag_of_Canada.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/4\/48\/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/8\/8a\/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/9\/99\/Question_book-new.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/2\/21\/Vancouver_Maritime_Museum_%28emblem%29.png" ], "lat": 49.277507, "lng": -123.147265 }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -123.1473173, 49.2775568 ], [ -123.1473057, 49.2776737 ], [ -123.1470689, 49.2776692 ], [ -123.1470726, 49.2773111 ], [ -123.1473278, 49.2773159 ], [ -123.1473194, 49.2775082 ], [ -123.1474688, 49.277511 ], [ -123.1474717, 49.2774449 ], [ -123.148062, 49.2774558 ], [ -123.1480542, 49.2776327 ], [ -123.147464, 49.2776218 ], [ -123.1474667, 49.2775596 ], [ -123.1473173, 49.2775568 ] ] ] } },

The building was designed by architects Zeidler Roberts Partnership in joint venture with Musson Cattell Mackey Partnership and DA Architects + Planners.\nCanada Place can be reached via the SkyTrain line at the nearby Waterfront Station terminus or via West Cordova Street in Vancouver. The white sails of the building have made it a prominent landmark for the city, as well as drawing comparisons to the Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia and the Denver International Airport in Denver, Colorado.The structure was expanded in 2001 to accommodate another cruise ship berth. In 2009\/10, for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Canada Place served as the Main Press Centre.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nCanada Place was built on the land which was originally the Canadian Pacific Railway's Pier B-C. Built in 1927, its primary purpose was to serve CPR and other shipping lines trading across the Pacific Ocean.In 1978 Federal, Provincial and Municipal governments commenced planning for development of convention, cruise ship and hotel facilities. Four years later, the Government of Canada created a crown corporation, Canada Harbour Place Corporation (known as Canada Place Corporation until 2012), to develop the Canada Place project on the Pier B-C site. Construction began when Queen Elizabeth II arrived on the Royal Yacht Britannia with Pierre Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada and William R. Bennett, Premier of BC to initiate the first concrete pour.\nDuring Expo 86, the Canada Pavilion at Canada Place was opened by Prince Charles and Brian Mulroney, Prime Minister of Canada. Among the largest and most elaborate pavilions presented by any nation at any World's Fair, the Canada Pavilion hosted more than 5 million visitors prior to the October 13, 1986 closing date.\nCanada Place Corporation (CPC), a Crown agent, continues to act as the coordinating landlord for Canada Place facilities.\n\n\n=== Events ===\nThroughout the year many community events are held at and hosted by Canada Place.\n\n\n== Pan Pacific Vancouver ==\n\nThe Pan Pacific Vancouver opened in January 1986 and has 503 rooms and suites, two restaurants, and a lounge.\nThe Hotel is operated by Pan Pacific Hotels and Resorts.\n\n\n== Heritage Horns ==\n\nThe Heritage Horns, formerly known as the 12 O'clock Horn, sound the first four notes of O Canada every day at noon and can be heard throughout Downtown Vancouver and beyond. The ten horns have five facing north and five facing east on the roof of the Pan Pacific hotel and have an output of 115 Decibels. They were the brainchild of Les Southwell, designed and constructed by Robert Swanson for Canada's centennial 1967, and funded by BC Hydro. They were originally on the roof of the BC Hydro building (now The Electra) and were silent when the headquarters was converted to condominiums in the early 1990s. The horns started sounding again on November 8, 1994 after being acquired, refurbished, and relocated to Canada Place. Due to complaints, the timer was changed from mechanical to electrical soon after to make them accurate. They sounded 26 times during the 2010 Olympics, once for each medal won by Canada. The first was at 7:30pm on February 13 for a silver won by Jennifer Heil. The Heritage Horns will also be sounding at 7:00 p.m. each evening from March 26 to April 16, 2020 in support of essential service workers across Canada. Another notable time signal in the area is the 9 O'Clock Gun across the harbour in Stanley Park.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBallantyne Pier - overflow cruise ship terminal in Vancouver\nCPR Pier B and C\nExpo 86\nThe Drop (sculpture)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website", "images": [ "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/c\/ca\/CanadaPlaceByNight.JPG", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/52\/Canada_Place_Landing.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/42\/Canada_Place_with_Downtown_Vancouver%2C_British_Columbia%2C_Canada_Masson.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/87\/Canadaplace-pano.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8c\/Heritage_Horns_at_the_Pan_Pacific_Vancouver.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/08\/Hertage_Horns_2013.ogg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/95\/Pan_Pacific_Vancouver_Lobby.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/7c\/Vancouver_Landsat.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/4\/4a\/Commons-logo.svg" ], "lat": 49.288635, "lng": -123.111119 }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -123.1138712, 49.2880742 ], [ -123.1138077, 49.2880958 ], [ -123.113825, 49.2881164 ], [ -123.1131075, 49.2883795 ], [ -123.1130244, 49.2883955 ], [ -123.1129566, 49.2884116 ], [ -123.1128327, 49.2883737 ], [ -123.1106231, 49.2891529 ], [ -123.1105603, 49.2890774 ], [ -123.1105081, 49.2890954 ], [ -123.1104123, 49.2889847 ], [ -123.1103164, 49.2890329 ], [ -123.110225, 49.2890358 ], [ -123.1101205, 49.2890187 ], [ -123.1100508, 49.2889761 ], [ -123.1100247, 49.2889222 ], [ -123.110029, 49.288871 ], [ -123.1100639, 49.2888199 ], [ -123.110151, 49.2887716 ], [ -123.1120363, 49.2880993 ], [ -123.1123004, 49.2879811 ], [ -123.1131772, 49.2876694 ], [ -123.1132204, 49.287655 ], [ -123.1134439, 49.2877212 ], [ -123.113482, 49.2877074 ], [ -123.1135272, 49.2877006 ], [ -123.1135649, 49.2877055 ], [ -123.1136026, 49.2877213 ], [ -123.1136281, 49.2877451 ], [ -123.1136388, 49.2877726 ], [ -123.1136366, 49.2877987 ], [ -123.1136817, 49.2878467 ], [ -123.113772, 49.2879621 ], [ -123.1138712, 49.2880742 ] ] ] } },

It was the home of Gustav Roedde and his family. The house was built in 1893 and was allegedly designed by architect Francis Rattenbury in the Queen Anne Revival style. After having been a rooming house for years, the house was restored and refurnished in the 1980s and has been open to the public as a museum since 1990.\n\n\n== The Roedde Family ==\nGustav Roedde (1860-1930) emigrated from Grossbodungen, Germany to Cleveland, US in 1882 where he completed his apprenticeship as a bookbinder. During a Halloween party, he met Matilda Cassebohm (1862-1951), who emigrated from the island of Helgoland, Germany. The two were married in Cleveland in 1883. Together they lived in different cities; San Francisco, California and Victoria, British Columbia, before settling down in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1888. Gustav Roedde's bookbindery blossomed along with Vancouver's quick development. His skills, such as the paper marbling technique, made him a successful businessman. The company continues to operate as G.A. Roedde Printers under new ownership.\nThe family grew to include seven children and three St. Bernard dogs. The family's first born, Anna Henrietta died at age four after eating poisoned berries. When World War I began, the sons Walter Herman Widemann (adopted) and William August travelled to Europe to fight for the British army and returned safely. During that time, daughter Emma Cather moved back to the Roedde House with her two daughters, Emma Gwendolyn and Kathleen Frances. Stories have been passed down, that the children used to play in the upstairs storage room to hear the adults’ conversations on the lower floor. In 1925, daughter Anna Catherine was killed at age 28, while on duty as a nurse at the Vancouver General Hospital. During the same year, the family moved to a new home on Drummond Drive, in Point Grey.\n\n\n== House history ==\n\nThe house's alleged architect, Francis Rattenbury (1867-1935), was an ambitious English immigrant. He also designed The Empress Hotel and Vancouver's 1910 provincial courthouse (currently the Vancouver Art Gallery). The Roedde House's asymmetrical plans, verandas and turret are all features of the Queen Anne Revival style. Both the interior and exterior of the house are made of cedar and fir, due to the cheap availability of lumber at the time.\nIn the late 1970s, the house was at risk of being demolished. The Community of Arts Council of Vancouver urged that the building not be torn down due to its historical significance. They succeeded and the house was designated a “Class A Heritage Building” in 1976, which meant that the house could not be moved, nor the exterior walls changed. The City of Vancouver restored the exterior of the house. In 1984, the Roedde House Preservation Society was formed to implement the interior restoration. Historical records were used to insure the house replicated what it would have looked like between 1893 and 1925. Stripping down wallpaper helped discover the original colours of the walls and the house was furnished with all the accoutrements of middle-class life in the 1890s. On May 12, 1990, the Roedde House Museum was officially opened by then-Mayor Gordon Campbell.\n\n\n== The Museum ==\nThe museum's collection of over 2,700 artifacts includes furniture, clothing, books and household items; some of which were owned by the Roedde family. Highlights include, the George III longcase clock manufactured in 1775, the upright Steinway piano dated 1893 and other interesting items like the stereoscope, the chestnut roaster and the universal bread maker.\nIn addition to guided tours, the museum features Classical and Jazz Concert series. On Sunday Tea and Tour, the museum serves the “Roedde House Blend”, made especially by the Metropolitan Tea Company for the Museum.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n1. Roedde House Museum Website\n2.

That garden, VanDusen Botanical Garden, is situated in the Shaughnessy neighbourhood of  Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada at the North West corner of 37th Avenue and Oak Street. It is named for local lumberman and philanthropist Whitford Julian VanDusen.The Botanical Garden opened to the public on August 30, 1975 and remains jointly managed by the Vancouver Park Board and the Vancouver Botanical Gardens Association (VBGA), similar to the operation of nearby Bloedel Conservatory. An administrative staff is bolstered by approximately 1200 non-gardening volunteers and six full-time unionized gardeners with seasonal interns assisting during the summer. The VBGA is responsible for membership, volunteering, education, the library, and development fundraising.\nVanDusen's volunteers have a 45-year history in the garden and often exhibit a proprietary connection to the trees, shrubs and annuals. Trained volunteer guides interpret the plant collection and the history of the garden to visitors on foot and in motorized golf carts from April through October (see web site for actual dates, the carts have a limited season). In addition to guiding tours, volunteers collect seeds of annuals and perennials (which they clean and package for sale in the garden shop and on the Internet). Other volunteers operate the information desk, produce dried flower arrangements, staff a large and very successful plant sale each spring, write and produce self-guided tours to hand out to visitors, package manure and compost for sale to local gardeners, and work with Park Board staff to install plant identification signs in the garden.\nThe Garden covers 22 hectares (55 acres). In addition to displays of plants from all over the world, there is an extensive collection of native British Columbia (Northwest Coast) plants. A recently launched \"re-wilding\" outreach program aims to rescue and propagate native plants for reintroduction into Vancouver's regional parks.\nAlthough the garden's mission statement upholds the ideals of a botanical garden, an early decision not to partake in scientific research channeled funds and energy into garden construction and released the staff from the responsibility of building research collections or a herbarium. The VBGA conducts citizen science initiatives and works with local community partners and schools interested in on-site research.\nMore recently, the garden's Visitor Centre was designed and built to a LEED Platinum standard. Opened in November 2011, this modern structure features a gift\/garden shop, a  specialized botanical library, a restaurant and a coffee shop. The VanDusen Botanical Garden Visitors Center project, registered with the International Living Future Institute, is pursuing a Living Building Challenge certification.\nThe building was constructed under the direction Cornelia Oberlander landscape architect, Perkins and Will Canada  architects, Morrison Hershfield energy consultants, Fast + Epp structural engineers, StructureCraft timber design-builders, and Ledcor Construction Limited.In addition to water features throughout the rolling landscape, special features in the garden include carved totem poles, large stone sculptures, and a Korean Pavilion. Children enjoy the maze adjacent to VanDusen's heirloom vegetable garden.\nThe Education Centre, located at the rear of the garden, houses a seed bank and serves as home to the Vancouver Festival of Lights volunteers, seed collectors, the Sakura Festival staff and the dried flower arrangers.\nMay is Rhodo time at VanDusen and visitors are treated to a large colourful collection of species and hybridized Rhododendron cultivars. The collection is estimated at nearly 1,000 different varieties of rhodos. Some can be found blooming virtually year round, with intense blooms of species rhodos in the Sino Himalayan garden in the late months of winter. Also of note are  cultivars of Fagus sylvatica, as well as collections of Sorbus, Fraxinus and Magnolia.\nSpecialized niche plantings include a Heather garden, a \"black\" garden, a seasonal \"Laburnum Walk\", a majestic stand of Sequoiadendron giganteum, a cypress pond, a formal perennial garden, a heritage vegetable garden (seasonal), a fragrance garden (seasonal) of course, and the large sino-Himalayan garden which covers about eight acres by itself.\nIn recognition of the extensive and timeless design work that makes VanDusen the pride of Vancouver's gardeners, R. Roy Forster was recognized with the Order of Canada on April 14, 1999, for his work in designing the gardens and their plant collections. Forester continued earlier landscape work established by Bill Livingston of the Vancouver Park Board. Appreciation for Forster's contribution to the design of the garden was recognized recently by VBGA renaming Cypress Pond the Roy Forster Pond.The garden is open to the public every day of the year except Christmas. There are admission fees for day visitors and memberships (family and individual) for repeat visitors.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in Canada\nSeed library\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVanDusen Botanical Garden website\nVanDusen Volunteer Seed Collectors' Online Store\nVanDusen Botanical Garden Association Library Photographs", "images": [ "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/d7\/Autumn_colours_at_VanDusen_Botanical_Garden.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/c\/ca\/Fall_colours_at_VanDusen_Botanical_Garden.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3d\/VanDusen_Botanical_Garden_1.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/50\/VanDusen_Botanical_Garden_3.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/ba\/VanDusen_Botanical_Garden_4.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/ee\/VanDusen_Botanical_Garden_5.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/b2\/VanDusen_Botanical_Garden_6.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/86\/VanDusen_Botanical_Garden_maze.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/4\/4a\/Commons-logo.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/9\/99\/Question_book-new.svg" ], "lat": 49.239722220000019, "lng": -123.13222222 }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -123.1280063, 49.2409171 ], [ -123.1300948, 49.2409899 ], [ -123.1345024, 49.2411679 ], [ -123.1361173, 49.2412331 ], [ -123.1361403, 49.2411555 ], [ -123.1361425, 49.2411138 ], [ -123.1361765, 49.2411096 ], [ -123.1361637, 49.2410638 ], [ -123.1361616, 49.2410221 ], [ -123.1361659, 49.2409915 ], [ -123.1361637, 49.2409762 ], [ -123.136104, 49.2409706 ], [ -123.1361058, 49.2408663 ], [ -123.1361088, 49.2407716 ], [ -123.135961, 49.2407705 ], [ -123.1359623, 49.2407187 ], [ -123.135814, 49.2407161 ], [ -123.1358186, 49.2406683 ], [ -123.1356742, 49.2406652 ], [ -123.1356691, 49.2406204 ], [ -123.1355143, 49.2406153 ], [ -123.1355201, 49.2405342 ], [ -123.1355225, 49.2404633 ], [ -123.1353743, 49.2404631 ], [ -123.1353766, 49.2404203 ], [ -123.1352267, 49.2404192 ], [ -123.1352271, 49.2403685 ], [ -123.135071, 49.240366 ], [ -123.1350628, 49.2403659 ], [ -123.1350672, 49.2402465 ], [ -123.1350328, 49.2402226 ], [ -123.1349975, 49.2402176 ], [ -123.1350134, 49.2401446 ], [ -123.1350903, 49.2400493 ], [ -123.1352388, 49.2399757 ], [ -123.1354283, 49.2399189 ], [ -123.1355897, 49.2398771 ], [ -123.1356972, 49.2398319 ], [ -123.1357848, 49.2397937 ], [ -123.1360609, 49.2397584 ], [ -123.1366141, 49.2397667 ], [ -123.1369624, 49.239765 ], [ -123.1374132, 49.2393989 ], [ -123.1377154, 49.2387952 ], [ -123.1377973, 49.2381113 ], [ -123.1370905, 49.2381015 ], [ -123.1347032, 49.238024 ], [ -123.1280985, 49.2377635 ], [ -123.1280483, 49.2394797 ], [ -123.1280063, 49.2409171 ] ] ] } },

Located at 1154 Gilford Street on English Bay near Stanley Park. Constructed in 1912, the Sylvia was designed as an apartment building by Mr. W.P. White, a Seattle architect. It was built by Booker, Campbell and Whipple Construction Company for a Mr. Goldstein, who had a daughter named Sylvia. During the Depression the Sylvia Court Apartments fell on hard times, and in 1936 the building was converted into an apartment hotel. With the advent of World War II, many of the suites were converted to rooms, to provide accommodation for crews of the merchant marine.\nAfter the war the number of permanent residents in the hotel gradually decreased, until by the sixties the Sylvia had become a completely transient full-service hotel. In 1954 it opened the first cocktail bar in Vancouver. Until 1958 the Sylvia Hotel was the tallest building in the West End – a well-known landmark, its brick and terracotta extension softened by the Virginia creeper that now completely covers the Gilford Street side of the hotel.  Until superseded by the West-End building boom of the 1960s, the hotel restaurant's slogan was \"Dine in the Sky\". \nIn 1975 the Sylvia was designated by the City of Vancouver as a \"heritage building\", thereby ensuring its survival for many years to come. \nThe famous Sylvia Hotel cat, \"Mr. Got To Go\", has inspired three popular children's books by Lois Simmie and illustrated by Cynthia Nugent. They are engaging tales of the stray cat who arrived at the Sylvia Hotel one day, took control of the premises and decided to check in permanently.  A feline resident – possibly the same cat – is mentioned in a song about the hotel by American folk singer-songwriter Cheryl Wheeler.\n\n\n== Sylvia Ablowitz ==\nSylvia Goldstein, (later Ablowitz) spent her childhood in the West End. A strong swimmer, she sometimes practised in English Bay and once won a race between the bay and Kitsilano Beach. (Later, she would attract the attention of her future husband, Harry Ablowitz, by diving into False Creek from a boat carrying Jewish singles on an outing.) After Sylvia completed a degree at the University of British Columbia, her family moved to Los Angeles, where she worked for a labour union. She returned to Vancouver in 1928, and met Harry, marrying him within a year and settling in North Vancouver. Together, they founded a realty company.\nSylvia and her husband were very committed to Jewish seniors. Sylvia worked with Jewish community groups, and she and Harry helped set up a rest home and hospital, now in operation for nearly 60 years. In her 90s, Sylvia was still volunteering for a telephone home-check program to help out other senior Jews. She died on April 12, 2002 at the University of British Columbia Hospital.\n\n\n== References ==\nTrek Magazine, University of British Columbia Alumni Association, Fall 2002, Retrieved January 1, 2006\nThe Sylvia Hotel on English Bay Vancouver Retrieved January 1, 2006\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of heritage buildings in Vancouver", "images": [ "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/6\/67\/Sylvia_hotel_vancouver.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/7c\/Vancouver_Landsat.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/9\/99\/Question_book-new.svg" ], "lat": 49.288684, "lng": -123.14239 }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -123.1421558, 49.2887385 ], [ -123.1422092, 49.2887041 ], [ -123.1422395, 49.2886848 ], [ -123.1424955, 49.2885172 ], [ -123.1425498, 49.2884824 ], [ -123.1427276, 49.2886002 ], [ -123.1423313, 49.2888547 ], [ -123.1421558, 49.2887385 ] ] ] } },

The archives serves as the repository for historical records generated by the City of Vancouver, including the Mayor's Office, the Parks Board, the Board of Police Commissioners, the Vancouver Police Department, and the Office of the City Clerk. It also contains numerous collections from private donors, businesses, and community groups. The archives are part of the City Clerk's Department.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe archives began as the personal collection of J. S. Matthews, who was born in Wales, and settled in Vancouver in 1898. For decades he collected and catalogued artifacts, solicited donations, interviewed early inhabitants of the young city, and wrote historical narratives.\nThe archives began in Major Matthews' home until he was eventually given space by the City in various locations and was officially made the City's archivist in 1933. He moved the collection back into his home for a period following a dispute with Mayor Gerry McGeer over ownership of the collection. The archives did not find a permanent home in his lifetime, but were given to the city with the condition of a dedicated building in his will within one year after his death in 1970.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe first space provided for the archives by the city was in the attic of the old City Hall on Main Street, in 1931. In 1933, the archives moved to the temporary City Hall in the Holden Building on East Hastings Street. In 1936, the archives moved again to the new City Hall at Cambie Street and West 12th Avenue. In 1959, the archives moved again to space in the Main Library on Burrard Street.The current archives building, located at 1150 Chestnut Street, is a semi-underground modern structure in Vanier Park, designed by Bill Leithead. When the building was opened in 1972, it was the first building in Canada built specifically as a city archive.\n\n\n== City Archivists ==\n1933–1970 J. S.

The hotel displays art on loan from each of these partner entities and has created a constantly evolving collection of international and First Nations art.\nThe hotel is a leader in sustainability in the Canadian hotel community. It was an inaugural participant in both the City of Vancouver's \"Corporate Climate Leader\" and Tourism Vancouver's \"Tourism Ambassador for Conservation\" programs. In addition to 20 solar panels and a state-of-the-art heat-capture program (reducing the hotel's natural-gas use by 30 percent annually), many water-reduction and air-quality programs and an ambitious bulk amenities program, the hotel has also been 100 percent zero-waste-to-landfill since 2011.\nForage, the hotel's restaurant, is a showcase in sustainable operations and is an active member of both the Green Table Network and the Vancouver Aquarium's Ocean Wise seafood program. The restaurant's small-plate menu is locally sourced.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nthelistelhotel.com, the hotel's official website", "images": [ "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/b7\/Flag_of_Vancouver_%28Canada%29.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/06\/Hotelli_723_tunnusosa.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/2a\/Industry5.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f4\/P_parthenon.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/b\/b4\/Ambox_important.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/c\/cf\/Flag_of_Canada.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/9\/99\/Question_book-new.svg" ], "lat": 49.28706, "lng": -123.12932 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -123.1291922, 49.2872256 ] } },

Right beside the Shaw Tower, it is also attached to the West Building of the Vancouver Convention & Exhibition Centre. The Southern and Eastern exteriors are wrapped with an art installation of a Liam Gillick poem. Fairmont Pacific Rim was developed by Westbank Corp. and the Peterson Group with architecture by James KM Cheng Architects Inc.This is the fourth Fairmont Hotel in the Vancouver Metropolitan Area.  The hotel occupies the first 22 floors of the 44 storey building, with the remaining floors being condominiums. There are a total of 175 residential condominium units beginning from the 23rd floor. The entrance for the residential units is located at 1011 Cordova Street W.The condominiums were sold at a price of $2,100 per square foot, one of the highest in Canada at the time.Glee actor Cory Monteith was found dead in his room on July 13, 2013. He was 31 years old.

It is the home of the Vancouver Convention Centre, the Pan Pacific Vancouver Hotel, Vancouver's World Trade Centre, and the virtual flight ride FlyOver Canada. The building's exterior is covered by fabric roofs resembling sails. It is also the main cruise ship passenger terminal for the region, where cruises to Alaska originate. The building was designed by architects Zeidler Roberts Partnership in joint venture with Musson Cattell Mackey Partnership and DA Architects + Planners.\nCanada Place can be reached via the SkyTrain line at the nearby Waterfront Station terminus or via West Cordova Street in Vancouver. The white sails of the building have made it a prominent landmark for the city, as well as drawing comparisons to the Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia and the Denver International Airport in Denver, Colorado.The structure was expanded in 2001 to accommodate another cruise ship berth. In 2009\/10, for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Canada Place served as the Main Press Centre.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nCanada Place was built on the land which was originally the Canadian Pacific Railway's Pier B-C. Built in 1927, its primary purpose was to serve CPR and other shipping lines trading across the Pacific Ocean.In 1978 Federal, Provincial and Municipal governments commenced planning for development of convention, cruise ship and hotel facilities. Four years later, the Government of Canada created a crown corporation, Canada Harbour Place Corporation (known as Canada Place Corporation until 2012), to develop the Canada Place project on the Pier B-C site. Construction began when Queen Elizabeth II arrived on the Royal Yacht Britannia with Pierre Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada and William R. Bennett, Premier of BC to initiate the first concrete pour.\nDuring Expo 86, the Canada Pavilion at Canada Place was opened by Prince Charles and Brian Mulroney, Prime Minister of Canada. Among the largest and most elaborate pavilions presented by any nation at any World's Fair, the Canada Pavilion hosted more than 5 million visitors prior to the October 13, 1986 closing date.\nCanada Place Corporation (CPC), a Crown agent, continues to act as the coordinating landlord for Canada Place facilities.\n\n\n=== Events ===\nThroughout the year many community events are held at and hosted by Canada Place.\n\n\n== Pan Pacific Vancouver ==\n\nThe Pan Pacific Vancouver opened in January 1986 and has 503 rooms and suites, two restaurants, and a lounge.\nThe Hotel is operated by Pan Pacific Hotels and Resorts.\n\n\n== Heritage Horns ==\n\nThe Heritage Horns, formerly known as the 12 O'clock Horn, sound the first four notes of O Canada every day at noon and can be heard throughout Downtown Vancouver and beyond. The ten horns have five facing north and five facing east on the roof of the Pan Pacific hotel and have an output of 115 Decibels. They were the brainchild of Les Southwell, designed and constructed by Robert Swanson for Canada's centennial 1967, and funded by BC Hydro. They were originally on the roof of the BC Hydro building (now The Electra) and were silent when the headquarters was converted to condominiums in the early 1990s. The horns started sounding again on November 8, 1994 after being acquired, refurbished, and relocated to Canada Place. Due to complaints, the timer was changed from mechanical to electrical soon after to make them accurate. They sounded 26 times during the 2010 Olympics, once for each medal won by Canada. The first was at 7:30pm on February 13 for a silver won by Jennifer Heil. The Heritage Horns will also be sounding at 7:00 p.m. each evening from March 26 to April 16, 2020 in support of essential service workers across Canada. Another notable time signal in the area is the 9 O'Clock Gun across the harbour in Stanley Park.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBallantyne Pier - overflow cruise ship terminal in Vancouver\nCPR Pier B and C\nExpo 86\nThe Drop (sculpture)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website", "images": [ "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/c\/ca\/CanadaPlaceByNight.JPG", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/52\/Canada_Place_Landing.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/42\/Canada_Place_with_Downtown_Vancouver%2C_British_Columbia%2C_Canada_Masson.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/87\/Canadaplace-pano.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8c\/Heritage_Horns_at_the_Pan_Pacific_Vancouver.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/08\/Hertage_Horns_2013.ogg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/95\/Pan_Pacific_Vancouver_Lobby.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/7c\/Vancouver_Landsat.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/4\/4a\/Commons-logo.svg" ], "lat": 49.288635, "lng": -123.111119 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -123.1079022, 49.2895459 ] } },

Located at 240 E. Cordova Street in Vancouver's Gastown, the museum is housed in a building that was once both the Coroner’s Court and autopsy facilities (until 1980) and the City Analyst’s laboratory (until 1996). In 1935, the Coroner's Court was used as a makeshift hospital by police during the Battle of Ballantyne Pier. It was designed by architect Arthur J. Bird, and today it is a municipally designated heritage building.\nThe museum is run by the Vancouver Police Historical Society, a non-profit organization established in 1983 with the mandate to foster interest in the history of the Vancouver Police Department and to open a museum for this purpose. The catalyst for the project was the museum's first curator, Joe Swan, a former police sergeant and amateur historian. Swan wrote the department's official history book, which was published by the Vancouver Historical Society in 1986, entitled, A Century of Service: The Vancouver Police, 1886-1986.\nThe museum houses a collection of approximately 20,000 objects. This includes archival documents, photographs, publications, confiscated firearms and other weapons, counterfeit currency, and various other artifacts and memorabilia, of which an estimated 40% is on display. The museum offers educational programs for children and walking tours of the neighbourhood on the theme, \"Sins of the City.\" The museum has a gift shop and publishes a quarterly newsletter.\nThe museum is self-funded through admission and program fees, membership fees, donations, gift shop sales, and project grants; the museum receives no direct funding from the Vancouver Police Department or the City of Vancouver but does receive in-kind support.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of heritage buildings in Vancouver\nList of museums in British Columbia\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website", "images": [ "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/ea\/Coroner%27s_Court.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/fc\/Maple_Leaf_%28from_roundel%29.svg" ], "lat": 49.28194444, "lng": -123.09916667 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -123.0981897, 49.2820831 ] } },

Named after Francis Brockton, it is the most easterly part of Stanley Park and is home to a 100-year-old lighthouse and several hand-carved totem poles made in British Columbia.\nPart of the land at the point was first cleared in 1865 in order to construct a sawmill.  Due to rough currents around the point and a reef offshore, the Burnaby Shoal, however, the mill was built in Gastown and the point instead became the primary sports fields of early Vancouver. The main sporting venue, Brockton Oval, has been visited by cricket players such as Donald Bradman, Fred Trueman and Geoffrey Boycott. Cricket and rugby are still played here.\n\n\n== History ==\nBefore 1865, the point was utilized as a graveyard for early settlers who came to Vancouver.  That year, Edward Stamp—a British businessman in the timber industry—cleared away part of the site in order to build a sawmill.  However, he was forced to abandon his plans after realizing the strong currents from the harbour impeded the construction of log booms.  He ended up moving the mill to Gastown, becoming Hastings Mill.The land cleared by Stamp was converted into sports fields by 1891. One of these, Brockton Oval, became a key amateur sports venue and was mostly used for cricket.  Donald Bradman and Fred Trueman both played at the Oval, and after Bradman's visit in 1932, he called the venue the most beautiful cricket ground in the world.  Geoffrey Boycott also played at the grounds in September 1964 and echoed Bradman's sentiments and praise of the Oval.\n\n\n=== Totem poles ===\n\nOne of the province's most popular attractions is a group of ten totem poles at Brockton Point. Four totem poles were originally brought from Alert Bay and placed at Lumbermen's Arch in 1924.  Some had been carved back in the late 1880s.  More totem poles were purchased in the 1920s and 1930s, this time originating from the Haida Gwaii and Rivers Inlet. All of the totem poles were moved to Brockton Point in 1962 to allow the construction of an overhead road at Lumberman's Arch. Many of them have been replaced with replicas, with the originals now kept in museums for preservation. The most recent addition, erected in 2009, was carved by a member of the Squamish Nation whose mother was born in Stanley Park.\n\n\n== Lighthouse ==\nA number of ship collisions in the waters around the point led to the construction of a lighthouse and signaling station at Brockton Point. For a time, Brockton Point had a lighthouse keeper, who served for 25 years starting in 1855 and is credited for having saved 16 people from drowning. The present day lighthouse tower with an automatic light was built in 1914.  It was designed by British Landscape Architect Thomas Hayton Mawson, who also constructed the lifeboat house located below the point and other Stanley Park landmarks.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of lighthouses in British Columbia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCricket ground photo from 2002\nMatches played on this cricket ground", "images": [ "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/af\/Brockton_Point%2C_Stanley_Park%2C_Vancouver_%282012%29_-_1.JPG", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/88\/Canada_British_Columbia_relief_location_map.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/b0\/Cricketball.png", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/77\/Lighthouse_icon_centered.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/7a\/Nuvola_apps_kcmsystem.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/04\/P1030295_-_Vancouver_-_Stanley_Park_-_totem.JPG", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/4\/4a\/Commons-logo.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/c\/cf\/Flag_of_Canada.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/4\/48\/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg" ], "lat": 49.30089, "lng": -123.11704 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -123.1170478, 49.3008242 ] } },

The structure, at 301 Park Avenue between 49th and 50th streets, is a 47-story 625 ft (191 m) Art Deco landmark designed by architects Schultze and Weaver, which was completed in 1931. The building was the world's tallest hotel from 1931 until 1963, when it was surpassed by Moscow's Hotel Ukraina by 23 feet (7.0 m). An icon of glamour and luxury, the current Waldorf Astoria is one of the world's most prestigious and best-known hotels.  Waldorf Astoria Hotels and Resorts is a division of Hilton Hotels, and a portfolio of high-end properties around the world now operate under the name, including in New York City. Both the exterior and the interior of the Waldorf Astoria are designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission as official landmarks.\nThe original Waldorf–Astoria was built in two stages, as the Waldorf Hotel and the Astoria Hotel, which accounts for its dual name. That original site was situated on Astor family properties along Fifth Avenue, opened in 1893, and designed by Henry J. Hardenbergh. It was demolished in 1929 to make way for the construction of the Empire State Building. \nParticularly after its relocation, the Waldorf Astoria gained international renown for its lavish dinner parties and galas, often at the center of political and business conferences and fundraising schemes involving the rich and famous. Particularly after World War II it played a significant role in world politics and the Cold War, culminating in the controversial World Peace Conference of March 1949 at the hotel, in which Stalinism was widely denounced. Conrad Hilton acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949, and the Hilton Hotels Corporation finally bought the hotel outright in 1972. It underwent a $150 million renovation by Lee Jablin in the 1980s and early 1990s, and in October 2014 it was announced that the Anbang Insurance Group of China had purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US$1.95 billion, making it the most expensive hotel ever sold. On July 1, 2016, Anbang announced that it would convert some of the Waldorf's hotel rooms into condominiums, closing the hotel for a three-year renovation on March 1, 2017. The renovated structure will house 375 hotel rooms and 375 brand-new residential condos.The Waldorf Astoria and Towers has a total of 1,413 hotel rooms as of 2014. In 2009, when it had 1,416 rooms, the main hotel had 1,235 single and double rooms and 208 mini suites, while the Waldorf Towers, from the 28th floor up to the 42nd, had 181 rooms, of which 115 were suites, with one to four bedrooms. Several of the luxury suites are named after celebrities who lived or stayed in them such as the Cole Porter Suite, the Royal Suite, named after the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, the MacArthur Suite and the Churchill Suite. The most expensive room, the Presidential Suite, is designed with Georgian-style furniture to emulate that of the White House. It was the residence of Herbert Hoover from his retirement for over 30 years, and Frank Sinatra kept a suite at the Waldorf from 1979 until 1988. The hotel has three main restaurants: Peacock Alley, The Bull and Bear Steak House, and La Chine—a new Chinese restaurant that replaced Oscar's Brasserie in late 2015. Sir Harry's Bar, also located in the hotel, is named after British explorer Sir Harry Johnston.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name of the hotel is ultimately derived from the town of Walldorf, which lies in the north of the German state of  Baden-Württemberg, south of Mannheim and Heidelberg. Walldorf is the ancestral home of the prominent German-American Astor family who originated there. In German, \"Waldorf\" (with one l, like the hotel) means \"Whale Village\" (Wal = whale, Dorf = village), and \"Walldorf\" (with two l's, like the town) means \"Rampart Village\" (Wall = rampart). The name of the town, however, formed through an elision: \"Walddorf\" (with two d's), meaning \"Forest Village\" (Wald = forest), became \"Walldorf\". An oak tree in the coat of arms of the town refers to this etymology.\nThe hotel was originally known as the Waldorf-Astoria with a single hyphen, as recalled by a popular expression and song, \"Meet Me at the Hyphen\". The sign was changed to a double hyphen, looking similar to an equals sign, by Conrad Hilton when he purchased the hotel in 1949. The double hyphen visually represents \"Peacock Alley\", the hallway between the two hotels that once stood where the Empire State building now stands today. The use of the double hyphen was discontinued by parent company Hilton in 2009, shortly after the introduction of the Waldorf Astoria Hotels and Resorts chain. The hotel has since been known as the Waldorf Astoria New York, without any hyphen, though this is sometimes shortened to the Waldorf Astoria.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Original buildings ===\n\n\n==== Creation ====\nThe original hotel started as two hotels on Fifth Avenue built by feuding relatives. The first hotel, the 13-story, 450-room Waldorf Hotel, designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh in the German Renaissance style, was opened on March 13, 1893, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street, on the site where millionaire developer William Waldorf Astor had his mansion. The original hotel stood 225 feet (69 m) high, with a frontage of about 100 feet (30 m) on Fifth Avenue, with an area of 69,475 square feet (6,454.4 m2). The original hotel was described as having a \"lofty stone and brick exterior\", which was \"animated by an effusion of balconies, alcoves, arcades, and loggias beneath a tile roof bedecked with gables and turrets\". William Astor, motivated in part by a dispute with his aunt Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor, had built the Waldorf Hotel next door to her house, on the site of his father's mansion. The hotel was built to the specifications of founding proprietor George Boldt, who owned and operated the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, a fashionable hotel on Broad Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with his wife Louise. Boldt was described as \"Mild mannered, undignified, unassuming\", resembling \"a typical German professor with his close-cropped beard which he kept fastidiously trimmed... and his pince-nez glasses on a black silk cord\". Boldt continued to own the Bellevue even after his relationship with the Astors blossomed.\nAt first, the Waldorf appeared destined for failure. It was originally a laughing stock with its high number of bathrooms and was known briefly as \"Boldt's Folly\" or \"Astor's Folly\", with the general perception of the palatial hotel being that it had no place in New York City. Wealthy New Yorkers were angry because they viewed the construction of the hotel as the ruination of a good neighborhood. Business travelers found it too expensive and too far uptown for their needs. In the face of all of this, George Boldt decided that the hotel would host a benefit concert for St. Mary's Hospital for Children on its opening day. The hospital was the favorite charity of those on the Social Register. The ballroom filled with many of New York's First Families, who had paid five dollars for the concert and dinner at the Waldorf. It soon became a major success, earning $4.5 million in its first year, exorbitant for that period.\n\nWilliam Astor's construction of a hotel next to his aunt's house worsened his feud with her, but with Boldt's assistance, Waldorf's cousin, John Jacob Astor IV, persuaded his mother to move uptown. On November 1, 1897, John Jacob Astor IV opened the 17-story Astoria Hotel on an adjacent site, and leased it to Boldt. The hotels were initially built as two separate structures, but Boldt planned the Astoria so it could be connected to the Waldorf by an alley. Peacock Alley was constructed to connect the two buildings, and the hotel subsequently became known as the \"Waldorf-Astoria\", the largest hotel in the world at the time.\n\n\n==== Heyday ====\nWith a telephone in every room and first-class room service, the hotel was designed specifically to cater to the needs of socially prominent \"wealthy upper crust\" of New York and distinguished foreign visitors to the city. The hotel became, according to author Sean Dennis Cashman, \"a successful symbol of the opulence and achievement of the Astor family\". It was the first hotel to offer complete electricity and private bathrooms. Founding proprietor Boldt, whose motto was \"the guest is always right\", became wealthy and prominent internationally, if not so much a popular celebrity as his famous employee, Oscar Tschirky, known as \"Oscar of the Waldorf\", maître d'hôtel from the hotel's inauguration in 1893 until his retirement in 1943. Tschirky had arrived in the United States from Switzerland 10 years prior to applying for the position at the new Waldorf, and over the years grew to possess a great knowledge of cuisine. He authored The Cookbook by Oscar of the Waldorf (1896), a 900-page book featuring all of the popular recipes of the day, including his own, for which he garnered great acclaim, such as Waldorf salad, eggs Benedict, and Thousand Island dressing, which remain popular worldwide today. James Remington McCarthy wrote in his book Peacock Alley that Oscar gained renown among the general public as an artist who \"composed sonatas in soups, symphonies in salads, minuets in sauces, lyrics in entrees\". In 1902, Tschirky published Serving a Course Dinner by Oscar of the Waldorf-Astoria, a booklet that explains the intricacies of being a caterer to the American and international elite. Tschirky had an excellent memory and an encyclopedic memory of the culinary preferences of many of the guests, which further added to his popularity. In 1937, for instance, he recalled the opening night and notable people present at the old Waldorf, a guest at the old building known to the public as Buffalo Bill, and spoke at length about the planning for the Panama Canal that took place at the Waldorf-Astoria.The Waldorf gained significant renown internationally for its fundraising dinners and balls, regularly attracting notables of the day such as Andrew Carnegie, who became a fixture. Banquets were often held in the ballroom for esteemed figures and international royalty. The Waldorf Astoria was influential in advancing the status of women, who were admitted singly without escorts. George Boldt's wife, Louise Kehrer Boldt, was influential in evolving the idea of the grand urban hotel as a social center, particularly in making it appealing to women as a venue for social events. On February 11, 1899, Oscar hosted a lavish dinner reception that the New York Herald Tribune cited as the city's costliest dinner at the time. Some $250 were spent per guest, with bluepoint oysters, green turtle soup, lobster, ruddy duck, and blue raspberries. One article that year claimed that at any one time, the hotel had $7 million worth of valuables locked in the safe, testament to the wealth of its guests. In 1902, a lavish dinner was organized for Prince Henry of Prussia, and in 1909, banquets attended by hundreds were organized for Arctic explorer Frederick Cook in September and Elbert Henry Gary, a founder of US Steel, the following month.The United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic was opened at the hotel on April 19, 1912, and continued there for some time in the Myrtle Room, before moving on to Washington, D.C. John Jacob Astor IV was one of the people who perished on its ill-fated journey. Seven senators were present on the subcommittee, including William Alden Smith (Republican, Michigan) as chair, Jonathan Bourne (R, Oregon), Theodore E. Burton (R, Ohio), Duncan U. Fletcher (Democrat, Florida), Francis G. Newlands (D, Nevada), George Clement Perkins (R, California), and Furnifold McLendel Simmons (D, North Carolina). The composition of the subcommittee was carefully chosen to represent the conservative, moderate, and liberal wings of the two parties.\n\nIn 1919, restaurateur Louis Sherry announced an \"alliance\" with the Waldorf-Astoria that involved both his candies and catering services. Although it was not disclosed at that time, at some point, ownership of Louis Sherry Inc. was significantly vested in \"Boomer-duPont interests\", a reference to Lucius M. Boomer, then chairman of the Waldorf-Astoria, and T. Coleman du Pont. Upon his death that year, William Waldorf Astor was reputed to have been worth £200 million, which he left in trust for his two sons Waldorf and John Jacob. His half share of the Waldorf Astoria and the Astor Hotel at the time were reported to have been worth £10 million. On the evening of November 15, 1926, the National Broadcasting Company broadcast its inaugural program from the grand ballroom of the old Waldorf-Astoria. Among the entertainers heard by radio listeners was Will Rogers. The network became the Red Network on January 1, 1927, when NBC launched its second network, designated the Blue Network. An antitrust suit forced the sale of the Blue Network in 1942; it became the American Broadcasting Company.The hotel faced stiff competition from the early 20th century, with a range of new hotels springing up in New York City such the Hotel Astor (1904), the St. Regis (1904), the Knickerbocker (1906), and the Savoy-Plaza Hotel (1927). By the 1920s, the hotel was becoming dated, and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north than 34th Street. The Astor family finally sold the hotel to the developers of the Empire State Building and closed the hotel on May 3, 1929. It was demolished soon after.\n\n\n=== Current building ===\n\n\n==== Early years and international politics ====\nThe idea of a new Waldorf-Astoria hotel was based on the concept that a large, opulent hotel should be available in New York for distinguished visitors. Financial backing was not difficult to get in the summer of 1929, as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious about whether this was the right time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, which had operated a power plant for Grand Central Terminal on the site. New York Central had promised $10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate.The new building opened on Park Avenue, between East 49th and East 50th streets, on October 1, 1931. It was the tallest and largest hotel in the world at the time, covering the entire block. The slender central tower became known as the Waldorf Towers, with its own private entrance on 50th Street, and consisted of 100 suites, about one-third of which were leased as private residences. President Herbert Hoover said on the radio, broadcast from the White House: \"The opening of the new Waldorf Astoria is an event in the advancement of hotels, even in New York City. It carries great tradition in national hospitality...marks the measure of nation's growth in power, in comfort and in artistry...an exhibition of courage and confidence to the whole nation\". About 2,000 people were in the ballroom listening to this speech, but by the end of the business day, the 2,200-room hotel had only 500 occupancies.  The Waldorf-Astoria did not begin operating at a profit until 1939. Lucius Boomer continued to manage the hotel in the 1930s and 1940s, a commanding figure to whom Tony Rey referred as \"the greatest hotelman of his era\". Boomer was elected chairman of the board of the Waldorf-Astoria Corporation on February 20, 1945, a position he held until his death in July 1947.Like the original hotel, from its inception, the Waldorf Astoria gained worldwide renown for its glamorous dinner parties and galas, often at the center of political and business conferences and fundraising schemes. Author Ward Morehouse III has referred to the Waldorf Astoria as \"comparable to great national institutions\" and a \"living symbol deep within our collective consciousness\". It had the \"greatest banquet department in the world\" at the time according to restaurateur Tom Margittai, with the center of activity being the Grand Ballroom. On August 3, 1932, some 200 people representing the \"cream of New York's literary world\" attended the Waldorf Astoria to honor Pearl S. Buck, the author of The Good Earth, which was the best-selling novel in the United States in 1931 and 1932. One dinner alone, a relatively \"small dinner\" attended by some 50 people in June 1946, raised over $250,000. During the 1930s and 1940s the hotel's guests were also entertained at the elegant \"Starlight Roof\" nightclub by the Waldorf-Astoria Orchestra and such noted musicians as: Xavier Cugat, Eddie Duchin, Lester Lanin and Glenn Miller.The hotel played a considerable role in the emerging Cold War and international relations during the postwar years, staging numerous events and conferences. On March 15, 1946, Winston Churchill attended a welcoming dinner at the hotel given by Governor Thomas E. Dewey, 10 days after making his famous Iron Curtain speech, and from November 4 to December 12, 1946, the Big Four Conference was held in Jørgine Boomer's apartment on the 37th floor of the Towers between the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to discuss the future of Eastern Europe. On November 24, 1947, 48 prominent figures of the Hollywood film industry, including various film executives such as Louis B. Mayer of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures, Spyros Skouras of 20th Century Fox, Albert Warner of Warner Bros., and Eric Johnston, the head of the Association of Motion Picture Producers, met at the Waldorf Astoria and discussed what would become the Waldorf Statement, banning people with Communist beliefs or tendencies from the Hollywood film industry. The statement was a response to the contempt of Congress charges against the so-called \"Hollywood Ten\".\nOn June 21, 1948, a press conference at the hotel introduced the LP record. From March 27 to 29, 1949, the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace, also known as the Waldorf World Peace Conference, was held at the hotel to discuss the emerging Cold War and the growing divide between the US and the Soviet Union. The conference came at time when deep anti-Communist sentiment and suspicion of the Soviet Union existed in the United States, following the Berlin Blockade and the Czechoslovak coup d'état the previous year. The event was organized by the struggling American Communist Party. It was sponsored by many individuals who were not Stalinists, such as Leonard Bernstein, Marlon Brando, Albert Einstein, and Aaron Copland. They joined with the intention of promoting peace, and the Party found them useful. The conference was attended by the likes of Soviet Foreign Minister Andrey Vyshinsky, composer and pianist Dmitri Shostakovich, and writer Alexsander Fadeyev. Tension mounted during the controversial event, and culminated when Shostakovich, in front of a crowd of some 800 people, launched a scathing attack on western civilization, announcing, \"a small clique of hatemongers was preparing world public opinion for the transition from cold war to outright aggression\". The event was picketed in a counterattack by anti-Stalinists running under the banner of America for Intellectual Freedom, and prominent individuals such as Irving Howe, Dwight Macdonald, Mary McCarthy, Robert Lowell, and Norman Mailer angrily denounced Stalinism at the hotel. In 1954, Israeli statesman and archaeologist Yigael Yadin met secretly with the Syriac Orthodox Archbishop Mar Samuel in the basement of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel to negotiate the purchase of four Dead Sea Scrolls for Israel. The scrolls were kept in a vault at the Waldorf-Astoria branch of New York's Chemical Bank. At the request of the Israeli government, respected biblical scholar Dr. Harry Orlinsky examined the scrolls and verified their authenticity; Yadin paid $250,000 for all four. Restaurateur George Lang began working at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in 1955, and on December 13, 1955, he helped organize the American Theatre Wing's First Night Ball to celebrate Helen Hayes's 50th year in show business. He did much to organize dinners at the Waldorf to assist Hungarian issues and relief. On one occasion, an event was attended by  Edward G. Robinson and pianist Doklady and some $60,000 were raised.\n\n\n==== April in Paris Ball ====\n\nThe April in Paris Ball was an annual gala event whose mission was to improve Franco–American relations, to share cultures, and to help provide assistance to US and French charities, aside from commemorating the 2000th anniversary of the founding of Paris. It was established by Claude Philippe, the hotel banquet manager, in 1952. While the hotel's management handled invitations and publicity, other details were coordinated by socialites. Elsa Maxwell was given the primary responsibility in organizing it. It was initially held annually in April, but according to Ann Vaccaro, former executive director of the ball, it was changed to October because \"Mr. Philippe decided that because there are so many balls in the spring, he would make it in October\". After being changed to October, it often marked the start of the US fall social season. It was staged in the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf for eight years before moving to the Hotel Astor in 1960, the Seventh Regiment Armory in 1961, and other venues.The ball was designed to cater for \"very, very high-class people\" according to Vaccaro. Raffle tickets cost US$100 per person and offered opulent prizes such as a US$5000 bracelet and other jewels, expensive furs, perfumes, and even cars. In the 1960 event, prizes given included a Ford Thunderbird car, a chinchilla coat, a Renault Dauphine, a TV Hi-Fi system, an electric typewriter, 25 cases of expensive French wines, original paintings and porcelains, jewels, clocks, evening bags, and a pedigreed poodle; guests were given gift boxes containing gold key rings and jewelry, champagne and brandy, Maxim ashtrays, pipes, silver bottle openers, hats and scarves, and flowers. Every guest was said to have gone home with at least one gift in return. In the 1979 event, some US$106,000 worth of prizes was given out. Over its history, the ball, which was exempt from taxes, earned millions of dollars, which went primarily to over 20 American charities such as the American Cancer Society, with 15 to 20% going towards French charities. A staff of three people was paid full-time throughout the year to organize it. Of the expenses of the ball, founder Philippe stated, \"We charge the most, give the most, and make the most – it's a success formula\". Bernard F. Gimbel served as chief treasurer.\n\nThe Paris Ball became a notable event in the annual calendar during the 1950s, with one early show featuring a \"three-hour spectacular of five tableaux, directed by Stuart Chaney\", [depicting] a 12th-century scene of troubadours at the court of Eleanor of Aquitane, Henry VIII's meeting at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, Louis XIV at Versailles, and a fashion show of 40 creations by Dior, Fath, Balmain, Desses, and Givenchy\". French stars Juliette Gréco, Jean Sablon, Beatrice Lillie, John Loder and many others were flown over for the ball. The 1957 event was attended by some 1300 guests, including the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Senator John F. Kennedy, his wife, Jackie, and Marilyn Monroe, who paid $100 each and donated $130,000 to charities. The following year, the ballroom was decorated with 30 feet (9.1 m) high chestnut trees, earning US$170,000 for charities.  The final ball to be hosted in the hotel was held on April 10, 1959, with the main theme being the Parisian circus of the 18th century. Genuine circus costumes from the period were flown over from France, and the ball was attended by Marlene Dietrich, who performed two Maurice Chevalier songs, wearing a top hat, trousers, a waistcoat, and white gloves.\n\n\n=== Later history ===\nOn May 6, 1963, Time celebrated its 40th anniversary at the hotel. The event was attended by some 1500 celebrities, including General Douglas MacArthur, Jean Monnet, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., Bob Hope, Joe Louis, David O. Selznick, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Edward Kennedy, Henry Ford II, and many others.  In 1968, British rock band The Who checked into the hotel, where they encountered difficulties with the staff of the Waldorf Astoria. Due to the band's reputation for trashing their hotel rooms and rowdy behavior, the Waldorf demanded that they pay cash up front. However, following their gig, the band members were refused access to their hotel rooms, where their luggage was being kept. Tony Fletcher, in his biography on Keith Moon, claims that Moon challenged the staff and blew the door to their room off the hinges with his cherry bombs and retrieved their luggage, which prompted The Who to be shown the door and banned from the hotel for life. However, clearly the ban was later revoked as they performed at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction at the Waldorf on January 17, 1990.\n\nSoon after the opening of the hotel in 1931, hotelier Conrad Hilton, almost bankrupt at the time, reportedly cut out a photograph of the hotel from a magazine and wrote across it, \"The Greatest of Them All\". He acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949. The Hilton Hotels Corporation finally bought the hotel outright in 1972.In the 1970s, the Waldorf Astoria continued to play an important role in international politics, particularly between the US and the Middle East. In November 1974, a \"20-car motorcade, with eight shotgun-toting police marksmen aboard in bullet-proof vests\" brought Palestinian Fatah party leader Farouk Kaddoumi to the Waldorf from John F. Kennedy International Airport. The Waldorf was on red alert, and German Shepherd sniffer dogs were brought in prior to his arrival to look for possible bombs. Fifteen suites of the hotel were reserved for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) delegation. The following month, President Ford met with Nelson Rockefeller after he was voted Vice President, and a 90-minute press conference was held in a suite in the hotel. In November 1975, the US government insisted that PLO leader Yasser Arafat stay at the Waldorf during his visit to America, against the wishes of the hotel staff; security was stepped up severely. On August 12, 1981, IBM unveiled its Personal Computer in a press conference at the Waldorf Astoria, and in 1985, the NBA held its first-ever draft lottery between nonplayoff teams at the Starlight Room. The lottery was for the 1985 NBA Draft in which Patrick Ewing was the consensus number-one pick.Lee Jablin, of Harman Jablin Architects, fully renovated and upgraded the historical property to its original grandeur during the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s in a $150 million renovation.  The hotel was named an official New York City Landmark in 1993. On May 27, 2001, the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America had a grand banquet at the hotel to celebrate the 1700th anniversary of Armenia's conversion to Christianity, with Ambassador Edward Djerejian as guest speaker. On May 7, 2004, a press conference was held by MGM, discussing Steve Martin's The Pink Panther of the Pink Panther series. The 5th Annual DGA Honors Gala was held at the Waldorf on September 29.In 2006, Hilton launched Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts, a brand named for the hotel. Branches of the Waldorf Astoria are now located in Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, and Louisiana in the United States, and abroad in France, Israel, Italy, and Saudi Arabia. In 2006, Hilton was reported to be considering opening a new Waldorf Astoria hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. In 2008, the Waldorf Astoria opened the Guerlain and Spa Chakra, Inc. spa at the hotel, as part of the Waldorf Astoria Collection, which offers a \"body massage and facial using Guerlain's age-defying Orchidee Imperiale skincare\".The Waldorf Astoria New York is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. \"The Towers of the Waldorf Astoria\" continues to operate as a boutique \"hotel within a hotel\". In October 2014,  the Anbang Insurance Group, based in China, was announced to have purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US$1.95 billion, making it the most expensive hotel ever sold.On July 1, 2016, Anbang announced plans to refurbish the hotel and turn some rooms into condominiums. Under the plan, some of the hotel's rooms will be turned into apartments, with the remainder of the rooms remaining hotel suites. As part of the refurbishment process, the hotel closed on March 1, 2017. The hotel's restaurants, including Peacock Alley, The Bull and Bear Steak House, and the recently opened La Chine, closed along with the hotel; they will reopen when the renovation is completed. A week after the hotel closed, on March 7, 2017, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission voted unanimously to list the interiors of the hotel's famous public spaces as New York City landmarks, protecting them from any alteration during the renovations. In November 2019 it was announced that the 375 condos in the Waldorf-Astoria would go on sale starting in early 2020, while the 350 remaining hotel rooms would not reopen until 2021.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nTravel America stated: \"To linger in the sumptuous salons of the Waldorf-Astoria is to step back in time. Your trip down memory lane is a flashback to the glamor days of the 1930s, when this Art Deco masterpiece was the tallest hotel in the world and the epicenter of elite society. A legendary limestone landmark occupying a whole block of prime real estate in midtown Manhattan, it's still a prestigious address that embodies luxury and power in the richest city on earth.\"\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\n\nThe hotel was designed by architects Schultze and Weaver and constructed at 301 Park Avenue, just north of Grand Central Terminal. That area was developed atop the existing railroad tracks leading to the station, as part of the Terminal City complex, wherein buildings like the Waldorf Astoria using \"air rights\" to the space above the tracks. The new building opened on October 1, 1931. The 47-story 190.5 m (625 ft) hotel was the tallest and largest hotel in the world, and remained so for a number of years.\n1,585 cubic feet (44.9 m3) of black marble was imported from Belgium, 600 cubic feet (17 m3) of Brech Montalto and 260 cubic feet (7.4 m3) of Alps Green arrived from Italy, and some 300 antique mantles were brought in to furnish it; 200 railroad cars brought some 800,000 cubic feet (23,000 m3) of limestone for the building's facing, 27,100 tons of steel for the skeleton superstructure, and 2.595 million square feet (241,100 m2) of terra cotta and gypsum block. The towers are brick-faced, which led many to believe that the builders ran out of money.Peacock Alley, a 300-ft-long corridor lined with amber marble, connects the two hotel buildings. Gilded, women of the times would enjoy walking along it and admiring themselves in the mirrors. In 1931,  as many as 36,000 people reportedly were walking down it on any given day. The Peacock Alley restaurant of the Waldorf took its name from the alley.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\n\nSuch is the architectural and cultural heritage of the hotel that tours are conducted of the hotel for guests. Frommer's has cited the hotel as an \"icon of luxury\", and highlights the \"wide stately corridors, the vintage Deco door fixtures, the white-gloved bellmen, the luxe shopping arcade\", the \"stunning round mosaic under an immense crystal chandelier\", and the \"free-standing Waldorf clock, covered with bronze relief figures\" in the main lobby. They compare the decor of the rooms to those of an English country house, and describe the corridors as being wide and plush-carpeted, which \"seem to go on forever\".The lobby floor contains the room registration and cashier desks, the Empire Room and Hilton Room, the private Marco Polo Club, the Wedding Salon, Kenneth's Salon, the Peacock Alley lounge and restaurant, and Sir Harry's Bar. From 1992 to 2013, Kenneth, sometimes called the world's first celebrity hairdresser, famed for creating Jacqueline Kennedy's bouffant in 1961, moved his hairdressing and beauty salon to the Waldorf after a 1990 fire destroyed his East 54th Street shop. In the main foyer is a chandelier measuring 10 feet (3.0 m) by 10 feet (3.0 m). The elevator is furnished with paneled pollard oak and Carpathian elm. Special desks in the lobby are allocated to transportation and theatre, where exclusive tickets to many of the city's prominent theatres can be purchased. The lobby is furnished with polished nickel-bronze cornices and rockwood stone. The grand clock, a 4000-lb bronze, was built by the Goldsmith's Company of London originally for the 1893 World Columbia Exposition in Chicago, but was purchased by the Waldorf owners.  Its base is octagonal, with eight commemorative plaques of presidents George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, Andrew Jackson, Benjamin Harrison, and Grover Cleveland, and Queen Victoria and Benjamin Franklin. A shield once belonging to the Waldorf was moved to the Alexis restaurant on W. Franklin Street in 1984. Several boutiques surround the lobby, which contains Cole Porter's Steinway & Sons floral print-decorated grand piano on the Cocktail Terrace, which the hotel had once given him as a gift. Porter was a resident at the hotel for 30 years and composed many of his songs here. The Empire Room is where many of the musical and dance performances were put on, from Count Basie, to Victor Borge, Gordon MacRae, Liza Minnelli, George M. Cohan, and Lena Horne, the first black performer at the hotel.\n\nThe third floor contains the Grand Ballroom, the Silver Corridor, the Basildon Room, the Jade Room, and the Astor Gallery. Numerous organizations hold their annual dinners in the grand ballroom of the Waldorf, including St. John's University President's Dinner, the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York's annual gala, during which the Deus Caritas Est Award for philanthropy is presented, and the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. The NASCAR Sprint Cup end-of-season awards banquet was held at the Waldorf-Astoria every year between 1981 and 2008 before moving to the Wynn in Las Vegas. It was held initially in the Starlight Room, but from 1985, it was staged in the Grand Ballroom, except in 2001 and 2002. On May 1, 2004, the Waldorf-Astoria was the venue for the Manhattan Hungarian Network Grand Europe Ball, a historic black-tie charitable affair co-chaired by Archduke Georg of Austria-Hungary which celebrated the enlargement of the European Union. Bob Hope was such a regular performer at the Ballroom that he said, \"I've played so many dinners in the Grand Ballroom, I always make a crack when I get up to speak that I leave my dinner jacket in the lobby so that I don't have to ship it to the Coast all the time\". Of note in the Astor Gallery are 12 allegorical females, painted by Edward Emerson Simmons. Every October, the Paris Ball was held in the Grand Ballroom, before moving to the Americana (now the Sheraton Center). It hosted a memorable New Year's Eve party with Guy Lombardo and the Royal Canadians, and Lombardo used to broadcast live on the radio there from the \"Starlight Roof\". Maurice Chevalier performed at the ballroom in 1965 in his last appearance. The Silver Corridor outside the ballroom bears a resemblance to the Peacock Alley, but is shorter and wider. The fourth floor has the banquet and sales offices, and many of the suites including Barron, Vanderbilt, Windsor, Conrad, Vertès, Louis XVI, and Cole Porter, named after the celebrities who stayed in them. The fourth floor was where the notorious Sunday-night card games were played. Also, it has a re-creation of one of the living rooms of Hoover's Waldorf-Astoria suite in the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum.\n\n\n==== Rooms and suites ====\n\nThe Waldorf Astoria and Towers has a total of 1,413 hotel rooms as of 2014.\nIn 2009, when it had 1,416 rooms, the main hotel had 1,235 single and double rooms and 208 minisuites, 17 of which were classified as \"Astoria Level\", which are upgraded rooms with deluxe amenities and complimentary access to the Astoria Lounge. The Waldorf Towers, from the 28th floor up to the 42nd, had 181 rooms, of which 115 were suites, with one to four bedrooms. As of the late 1990s, the hotel had a housekeeping staff of nearly 400, with 150 day maids and 24 night maids.\nThe rooms retain the original Art Deco motifs, although each room is decorated differently. The guests rooms, classified as Deluxe, Superior, and Luxury, feature \"Waldorf Serenity\" beds and have a marble bath or shower with amenities designed by Salvatore Ferragamo. The suites featured king or double beds and start in size at 450 square feet (42 m2). The smallest are the one-bedroom suites, which range from 450 to 600 square feet (42 to 56 m2), then the Signature suites have a separate living room and one or two bedrooms, which range from 750 to 900 square feet (70 to 84 m2), and finally, the suites of The Towers are generally larger and costlier still, and have a twice-daily maid service.\nThe Tower suites are divided into standard ones, The Towers Luxury Series, which have their own sitting room, the Towers Penthouse Series, the Towers Presidential-Style Suites, and finally the most expensive Presidential Suite on the 35th floor. The Penthouse Series contains three suites, The Penthouse, The Cole Porter Suite, and The Royal Suite, named after the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. They start at 1,800 square feet (170 m2) in size, with two or more bedrooms, and are fitted with a kitchen and dining room which can accommodate for 8–12 guests. The Towers Presidential-Style Suites are divided into the MacArthur Suite and the Churchill Suite, and have their own grand entry foyer. Like the Penthouse Series, they have their own kitchen and dining room. The 2,250 square feet (209 m2) Presidential Suite is designed with Georgian-style furniture to emulate that of the White House. It has three large bedrooms and three bathrooms, and boasts numerous treasures, including the desk of General MacArthur and rocking chair of John F. Kennedy.\n\n\n==== Other facilities ====\nA 2,500 square feet (230 m2) fitness center is on the 5th floor. The $21.5 million Waldorf Astoria Guerlain Spa was inaugurated on September 1, 2008 on the 19th floor. It features 16 treatment rooms and two relaxation lounges. The hotel has its own Business Center, a 1,150 square feet (107 m2) digital facility, where guests can access the Internet and photocopy. In 2004 the hotel launched a line of products in keeping with the Art Deco style of the hotel, reportedly becoming the first individual hotel in the world to have its own merchandise collection.\n\n\n==== Secret railway track ====\nThe hotel has its own railway platform, Track 61, that was part of the New York Central Railroad (later Metro-North Railroad), and was connected to the Grand Central Terminal complex. The platform was used by Franklin D. Roosevelt, James Farley, Adlai Stevenson, and Douglas MacArthur, among others. The platform was also used for the exhibition of American Locomotive Company's new diesel locomotive in 1946. In 1948, Filene's and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad also staged a fashion show on the platform. An elevator large enough for Franklin D. Roosevelt's automobile provides access to the platform. There is a pedestrian entrance from E 50th St., just to the left of the Waldorf Towers entrance. However, it is rarely opened to the public.\n\n\n== Restaurants and cuisine ==\n\nThe Waldorf Astoria was the first hotel to offer room service and was the first major hotel in the world to hire women as chefs, beginning in 1931. An extensive menu is available for guests, with special menus for children and for dieters. The executive chef of the Waldorf for many years was John Doherty, following the Austrian Arno Schmidt who held the position for ten years from 1969 to 1979. Restaurateur George Lang was awarded the Hotelman of the Year Award in 1975. As of the early 1990s, the hotel served over three million dishes a year, and got through 27,000 pounds of lobster, 100 pounds of beluga caviar, 380,000 pints of strawberries annually. The hotel has gained significant renown for its lavish feasts. During one grand feast for Francis Cardinal Spellman, over 200 VIP guests, according to Arno Schmidt, devoured some 3,600 pounds of fillet, 600 pounds of fresh halibut, 1,500 pounds of potatoes, and 260 pounds of petit fours, eaten on gold china plates. One 1973 feast by the Explorer's Club devoured hippo meat, a 4-foot (1.2 m) alligator, a baby shark, an amberjack tuna, a boa, wild boar hams, 480 pieces of breaded-fried cod tongues and cheeks, antelope steaks, two boxes of Chinese rabbit, and 20 pounds of rattlesnake.\n\nThe hotel has three main restaurants, Peacock Alley, The Bull and Bear Steak House, and Oscar's Brasserie, as well as a secondary restaurant, the Japanese Inagiku. At its peak in the late 1940s, the hotel once had nine restaurants. Peacock Alley, situated in the heart of the lobby, features an Art Deco design with gilded ceilings and includes a main restaurant, a bar and lounge, and three private dining salons. It is known primarily for its fish and seafood dishes. Sunday Brunch is particularly popular with locals and features over 180 gourmet dishes divided into 12 themed displays, with cuisine ranging from lobster and oysters to Belgian waffles, Eggs Benedict, and omelettes to hollandaise sauces. The Bull and Bear Steak House is furnished in richly polished mahogany in the English Regency style, and has a \"den-like\" atmosphere, and is reportedly the only restaurant on the East Coast which serves 28 days prime grade USDA Certified Angus Beef. It has won awards from the National Restaurant Association and Holiday magazine. Between 2007 and 2010, the restaurant was the filming location for Fox Business Happy Hour, presented live between 5 and 6 pm. The Bull and Bear Bar is based on the original Waldorf Astoria Bar, which was a favorite haunt of many of the financial elite of the city from the hotel's inception in 1893, and adventurers such as Diamond Jim Brady, Buffalo Bill Cody and Bat Masterson. Behind the bar are bronze statues of a bull and a bear, which represent the successful men of Wall Street. The Inagiku, meaning the \"rice chrysanthemum\", serves contemporary Japanese cuisine. The restaurant opens for lunch on weekdays and cocktails and dinner in the evenings. Designed by Henry Look of San Francisco, the restaurant has four \"distinctly different\" rooms, including one which represents an old Japanese farmhouse, and the Kinagu Room, resembling a Japanese temple. Guests have the option to reserve private orthodox tatami rooms.\n\nOscar's Brasserie, overlooking Lexington Avenue in what was once a Savarin restaurant, is designed by Adam Tihany. The restaurant takes its name from Oscar Tschirky (Oscar of the Waldorf) and serves traditional American cuisine, with many dishes based upon his cookbook which have gained world renown, including the Waldorf salad, Eggs Benedict, Thousand Island dressing, and Veal Oscar. The Waldorf salad—a salad made with apples, walnuts, celery, grapes, and mayonnaise or a mayonnaise-based dressing—was first created in 1896 at the Waldorf by Oscar. The original recipe, however did not contain nuts, but they had been added by the time the recipe appeared in The Rector Cook Book in 1928. Tschirky was also noted for his \"Oscar's Sauce\", which became so popular that it was sold at the hotel. Another of the hotel's specialties was red velvet cake, which became one of its most popular desserts.Sir Harry's Bar is one of the principal bars of the hotel, situated just off the main lobby. It is named after British Sir Harry Johnston (1858–1927). In the 1970s the bar was renovated in a \"plush African safari\" design to honor Johnston, a notable explorer of Africa, with \"zebra-striped wall coverings and carpeting, with bent-cane furnishings\". It has since been redecorated back to a more conservative design, with walnut paneling and leather banquettes, and featured a 23 feet (7.0 m) by 8 feet (2.4 m) ebony bar as of the early 1990s. Frank Sinatra frequented Sir Harry's Bar for many years. In 1991, while drinking at Sir Harry's with Jilly Rizzo and Steve Lawrence, he was approached by a fan asking for an autograph. Sinatra responded, \"Don't you see I'm on my own time here? You asshole. What's wrong with you?\" The fan said something which angered Sinatra, who lunged at the fan, and Sinatra had to be restrained.\n\n\n=== Cocktail books ===\nAlbert Stevens Crockett, the hotel's veteran publicist and historian, wrote his first cocktail book \"Old Waldorf Bar Days\" in 1931 during Prohibition and the construction of the current hotel on Park Avenue. It was an homage to the original hotel and its famous bar and clientele. The book contains Crockett's takes on the original hand-written leather bound book of recipes that was given to him at the time of the closure by bartender Joseph Taylor. This edition was never reprinted.In 1934, Crockett wrote a second book, \"The Old Waldorf Astoria Bar Book\", in response to the repeal of the Volstead Act and the end of the Prohibition era. He edited out most of the text from the first book. Drawing from his experiences as a travel writer, Crockett added nearly 150 more recipes, the bulk of which can be found in the \"Cuban Concoctions\" and \"Jamaican Jollifers\" chapters. These books became reference books on the subject of pre-Prohibition cocktails and its culture.In 2016, the long-time hotel bar manager of Peacock Alley and La Chine, Frank Caiafa, added a completely new edition to the canon. Caiafa's \"The Waldorf Astoria Bar Book\" includes all of the recipes in Crockett's books; many of the hotel's most important recipes created since 1935; and his own creations. In 2017, it was nominated for a James Beard Foundation Award for Best Beverage Book.Other notable books with connections to the hotel include \"Drinks\" (1914) by Jacques Straub, a wine steward and friend of Oscar Tschirky who had written about the first hotel's notable recipes. Tschirky himself compiled a list of 100 recipes for his own book \"100 Famous Cocktails\" (1934), a selection of favorites from Crockett's books. Finally, hotel publicist Ted Saucier wrote \"Bottoms Up\" in 1951, consisting of a compendium of popular, national recipes of the day.\n\n\n== Notable residents and tenants ==\n\n\n=== Leaders and businesspeople ===\n\nOn the 100th anniversary of the hotel in 1993, one publication wrote: \"It isn't the biggest hotel in New York, nor the most expensive. But when it comes to prestige, the Waldorf-Astoria has no peer. When presidents come to New York, they stay at the Waldorf-Astoria. Kings and queens make it their home away from home, as have people as diverse as Cary Grant, the Dalai Lama and Chris Evert. Some of them liked the hotel so well, they made their home there.\" From its inception, the Waldorf was always a \"must stay\" hotel for foreign dignitaries. The viceroy of China, Li Hung Chang stayed at the hotel in 1896 and feasted on hundred-year-old eggs which he brought with him. Over the years many royals from around the world stayed at the Waldorf Astoria including Shahanshah of Iran and Empress Farah, King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid of Denmark, Princess Astrid of Norway, Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Martha of Norway, King Baudouin I of Belgium and Queen Fabiola, Prince Albert and Princess Paola of Belgium, King Hussein I of Jordan, Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace of Monaco, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, King Michael of Romania, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip of the Commonwealth realms, Mohammed Zahir Shah and Homaira Shah of Afghanistan, King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit of Thailand, and Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko of Japan, Prince Frederick Joseph the great great  grandson of King Joseph Bonaparte and many others. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip stayed at the hotel during their first visit to America on October 21, 1957, and a banquet was held for them in the Grand Ballroom. In the Bicentennial year in 1976, most of the heads of state from around the world and all of the Kings and Queens of Europe were invited to the hotel, and it also served the presidential candidates in the run up to the elections of that year.\n\nIn modern times, the clientele of the Waldorf is more typically wealthy politicians and businessmen than playboys and royalty. An entire floor was often rented out to wealthy Saudi Arabians with their own staff. Wealthy Japanese businessmen during their stay would sometimes remove the furniture and replace it with their own floor mats. One early wealthy resident was Chicago businessman J. W. Gates who would gamble on stocks on Wall Street and play poker at the hotel. He paid up to $50,000 a year to hire suites at the hotel. Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was invited by Waldorf president Lucius Bloomer to stay at the hotel in the 1920s. Demands by people of prominence could often be exorbitant or bizarre, and Fidel Castro once walked into the hotel with a flock of live chickens, insisting that they be killed and freshly cooked on the premises to his satisfaction, only to be turned away. While serving as Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger ordered all of the antiques to be removed from one suite and replaced them with 36 desks for his staff. An unnamed First Lady also once demanded that all of the bulbs in her suite be changed to 100 watt ones and kept on all day and night to simulate daylight; she further insisted that there be an abundance of chewing gum available.\n\nPostmaster General James Farley occupied two adjoining suites in the current Waldorf Astoria during his tenure as the chairman of the board of Coca-Cola's International division from 1940 until his death in 1976, arguably one of the landmark's longest housed tenants. The Presidential Suite at the hotel come from when, during the 1950s and early 1960s, former U.S. president Herbert Hoover and retired U.S. General Douglas MacArthur lived in suites on different floors of the hotel. Hoover lived at the Waldorf Astoria for over 30 years from after the end of his presidency until he died in 1964; former President Dwight D. Eisenhower lived there between 1967 and 1969. MacArthur's widow, Jean MacArthur, lived there from 1952 until her death in 2000. A plaque affixed to the wall on the 50th Street side commemorates this. John F. Kennedy was fond of the Waldorf Astoria and had a number of private meetings at the hotel, including one with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. Since Hoover, every President of the United States has either stayed over or lived in the Waldorf Astoria, although Jimmy Carter claimed to have never stayed overnight at the hotel. Nancy Reagan was reputedly not fond of the Presidential Suite.\n\nThe official residence of the United States' Permanent Representative to the United Nations, an unnamed 42nd-floor apartment, was located in the Waldorf Towers for many years. On June 17, 2015, however, the US Department of State announced that it was moving its headquarters during meetings of the UN General Assembly to The New York Palace Hotel. Although State Department officials did not give an official reason for the change affecting both the President and hundreds of American diplomats and support staff who travel to New York for the General Assembly each September and usually stay and hold meetings on two secured floors at the Waldorf, they pointed to Hilton Worldwide's sale of the Waldorf-Astoria to China's Beijing-based Anbang Insurance Group for $1.95 billion in 2014, a deal that prompted security concerns. While the terms of the sale allow Hilton to run the hotel for the next 100 years, they also call for \"a major renovation\" that the officials say has raised eyebrows in the US Government because of concerns about Chinese eavesdropping and cyber espionage.Carlos P. Romulo, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines and member of the UN had suite 3600, below Hoover's, for some 45 years from 1935 onwards, and former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos also spent much time and money at the hotel. Another connection with the Philippines is that many meetings were held here between President Manuel L. Quezon and high ranking American politicians and senators. Through the meetings, Quezon encouraged investment into the country and convinced General MacArthur to accompany him back to the Philippines as his military adviser.\n\n\n=== Celebrities ===\n\nThe hotel has had many well-knowns under its roof throughout its history, including Charlie Chaplin, Ava Gardner, Liv Ullmann, Edward G. Robinson, Gregory Peck, Ray Bolger, John Wayne, Tony Bennett, Jack Benny, Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, Muhammad Ali, Vince Lombardi, Judy Garland, Sonny Werblin, Greer Garson, Harold Lloyd, Liberace, Burt Reynolds, Robert Montgomery, Cesar Romero, and many others. Due to the number of high-profile guests staying at the hotel at any one time, author Ward Morehouse III has referred to the Towers as a \"kind of vertical Beverly Hills. On any one given night you might find Dinah Shore, Gregory Peck, Frank Sinatra [or] Zsa Zsa Gabor staying there\". Gabor married Conrad Hilton in 1941. During the 1930s, gangster Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel owned an apartment at the Waldorf, and Frank Costello was said to have got his haircut and nails done in the Barber's Shop at the Waldorf. Around the time of World War I, inventor Nikola Tesla lived in the earlier Waldorf-Astoria.In 1955, Marilyn Monroe and her husband, Arthur Miller stayed at the hotel for several months, but due to costs of trying to finance her production company \"Marilyn Monroe Productions\", only being paid $1,500 a week for her role in The Seven Year Itch and being suspended from 20th Century Fox for walking out on Fox after creative differences, living at the hotel became too costly and Monroe had to move into a different hotel in New York City. Around the same time that Monroe lived in the hotel, Cole Porter and his wife Linda Lee Thomas had an apartment in the Waldorf Towers, where Thomas died in 1954. Porter's 1934 song \"You're the Top\", contains the lyric, \"You're the top, you're a Waldorf salad\". The Cole Porter Suite, Suite 33A, was the place where Porter lived and entertained for a period. Frank Sinatra paid nearly $1 million a year to keep it as his personal suite at the hotel between 1979 and 1988, which he called home when out of Los Angeles. Sinatra took over part of the hotel during the filming of The First Deadly Sin in 1980.\n\nGrace Kelly and Rainier III were regular guests at the hotel. At one time Kelly was reputed to be in love with the hotel banquet manager of the Waldorf, Claudius Charles Philippe. Elizabeth Taylor frequented the hotel, and would often attend galas at the hotel to talk about her various causes. Her visits were excitedly awaited by the hotel staff, who would prepare long in advance. Taylor was honored at the 1983 Friars Club dinner at the hotel.Brooke Shields has stated that her very first encounter with the paparazzi was in the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf at the age of 12, stating that she \"stood like a statue wondering why they were all hired to photograph me\", and that she \"debuted at the Waldorf\".  During her childhood in the 1980s and 1990s, Paris Hilton lived with her family in the hotel.\n\nOne of the most prestigious, the most exclusive and the most famous debutante balls in the world is the invitation-only International Debutante Ball held biennially in the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, where girls from prominent world families are presented to high society. Since 1954 the musical entertainment at the ball has traditionally been provided by the musicians of the Lester Lanin Orchestra.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Waldorf Astoria has been a filming location for numerous films and TV series. Ginger Rogers headlined an all star ensemble cast in the 1945 film Week-End at the Waldorf, set at the hotel and filmed partially on location there. Other films shot at the hotel include The Out-of-Towners (1970), Broadway Danny Rose (1984), Coming to America (1988), Scent of a Woman (1992), The Cowboy Way (1994), Random Hearts (1999), Analyze This (1999), For Love of the Game (1999), Serendipity (2001), The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), Maid in Manhattan (2002), Two Weeks Notice (2002), End of the Century (2005),  Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005), The Pink Panther  (2006), and The Hoax (2006). Television series that have filmed at the Waldorf include Law and Order, Rescue Me, Sex and the City, The Sopranos and Will and Grace.Several biographies have been written about the Waldorf, including Edward Hungerford's Story of the Waldorf (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1925) and Horace Sutton's Confessions of a Grand Hotel: The Waldorf-Astoria (New York: Henry Holt, 1953).Langston Hughes wrote a poem entitled \"Advertisement for the Waldorf-Astoria\", criticizing the hotel and inviting the jobless and homeless to take over the space of the hotel. Wallace Stevens wrote a poem entitled \"Arrival at the Waldorf\", in which he contrasts the wild country of the jungles of Guatemala to being \"back at the Waldorf\". In Meg Cabot's novel Jinx, the Chapman School Spring Formal takes place in the Waldorf-Astoria. It is at this point that Tory (the main antagonist) reveals Jean's first attempt at a love spell, which served as a catalyst for the novel's events.Waldorf of the Muppets series was named after the hotel. In the episode starring Dizzy Gillespie his heckling partner Statler (named after Statler Hilton, also in Manhattan) couldn't make it due to illness so Waldorf's wife Astoria came with him. Ayn Rand biographer Anne Heller wrote that the Waldorf Astoria inspired the \"Wayne-Falkland Hotel\" in Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tallest buildings in New York City\nThe Waldorf–Astoria Orchestra\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Explanatory notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n=== Further reading ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial hotel website\nOfficial corporate website\nWaldorf Astoria at the Internet Archive\nThe Astor Collection at the University of Virginia virtual exhibition of Native American artifacts originally displayed in the Grill Room of the Astor Hotel\nWaldorf–Astoria at History of New York City\nPlan of the lobby floor of the hotel", "images": [ "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/05\/%28Portrait_of_Frank_Sinatra%2C_Liederkrantz_Hall%2C_New_York%2C_N.Y.%2C_ca._1947%29_%28LOC%29_%284843758334%29.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/41\/58th_International_Debutante_Ball_2012%2C_New_York_City_%28Waldorf-Astoria_Hotel%29.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f3\/Cast_from_Parks_and_Recreation%2C_Portlandia_and_Game_of_Thrones_at_the_71st_Annual_Peabody_Awards.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/80\/Conrad_Hilton_%28croped%29.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/6\/63\/Dwight_D._Eisenhower%2C_official_photo_portrait%2C_May_29%2C_1959.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/6\/6c\/Elbert_Henry_Gary_banquet_at_Waldorf-Astoria_1909.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/07\/Eleanor_Roosevelt_and_the_Royal_Family_of_Norway_with_Princess_Juliana_of_the_Netherlands_and_Thomas_Watson_-_NARA_-_195657.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/d2\/Elizabeth_Taylor-1945.JPG", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/b8\/Elsa_Maxwell_Marilyn_Monroe_April_in_Paris_Ball_1957.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/ba\/Flag_of_New_York_City.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/47\/GCT_in_Blizzard_of_2015.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/c\/c7\/Khrushchev_family_at_the_Waldorf-Astoria_1959.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/b9\/Marlene_Dietrich_April_in_Paris_Ball_1959.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/0a\/NY_Octagon_Room_Waldof_Astoria_Hotel_1893.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/77\/Open_Access_logo_PLoS_transparent.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/97\/Oscar-Tschirky.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f4\/P_parthenon.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/57\/President_Hoover_portrait.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/ea\/St_Bartholomews_and_The_Waldorf_Astoria_Hotel.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/ab\/The_Waldorf_and_The_Astoria_Hotels%2C_New_York_City_c1915.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/31\/US_Senate_Committee_hearings_Titanic_sinking_1912.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/dc\/Waldolfastoriaelevatorlobby.JPG", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/10\/Waldorf-Astoria_menu_Archbishop_of_York_dinner.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/c\/c9\/Waldorf_-_Astoria_ad_1933.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/2c\/Waldorf_Astoria%2C_NY.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/ab\/Waldorf_Astoria_NY_logo.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/1c\/Waldorf_Astoria_buffet.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/da\/Waldorf_Astoria_exterior.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/99\/Waldorf_Astoria_foyer.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/db\/Waldorf_Astoria_lobby_view_2.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/74\/Waldorf_Towers_suite_30A.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/39\/Waldorfsalat.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f0\/William_Waldorf_Astor.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/13\/Women_in_Waldorf-Astoria.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/4\/4a\/Commons-logo.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/71\/Image-Grand_central_Station_Outside_Night_2.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/9\/94\/Symbol_support_vote.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/57\/Waldorf-Astoria_1904-1908b.jpg" ], "lat": 40.75638889, "lng": -73.974166669999946 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -123.0743321, 49.2814894 ] } },

The 4.6-metre (15 ft) sculpture of a square, cut and twisted \"like a paper clip\" to form an arch, is composed of weathered Corten steel that rusts to provide a protective layer. The work was installed in 1980 to commemorate the arrival of Captain George Vancouver in Burrard Inlet, following a competition sponsored by Parks Canada one year prior. Gate to the Northwest Passage received an adverse reaction initially, but reception has improved over time. The sculpture has been included in walking tours of the surrounding neighborhoods as a highlight of Vanier Park.\n\n\n== Background ==\nGate to the Northwest Passage was designed by Alan Chung Hung (1946–1994), who was born in Canton, China, moved to Vancouver in 1969, and studied at the Vancouver School of Art. Chung Hung's other works displayed in Vancouver include Spring (1981) and Clouds (1991).\n\nIn 1979, Parks Canada sponsored a competition for a permanent work to commemorate Captain George Vancouver, the first European to enter Burrard Inlet, in 1792. Guidelines for the competition required the use of permanent materials other than wood and that the work should \"not be in the likeness of a man\". Hugh Faulkner, Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development during 1977–1979, offered the opportunity for the sculpture, and the project was recommended by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. Gate to the Northwest Passage was selected by a five-person jury, led by former parks superintendent Stuart Lefeaux, then confirmed by the Parks Board. The work was originally to be installed at Stanley Park's Ferguson Point, but was sited in Vanier Park adjacent to the Vancouver Maritime Museum in 1980.The 4.6-metre (15 ft) sculpture of a square, cut and twisted \"like a paper clip\" to form an arch, is composed of weathered Corten steel. Each of the square's sides measure 0.9 metres (3.0 ft) x 0.9 metres (3.0 ft). The Corten steel rusts, forming a protective layer at the surface. The work, sited on a plaza of paving stones that measures 7.9 metres (26 ft) x 8.5 metres (28 ft), frames views of English Bay, the North Shore Mountains and the city. In their guide for public art in Vancouver, John Steil and Aileen Stalker suggested two sources for the sculpture's design: Chung Hung's training as a civil engineer, and the shapes of plane tables and quadrants, both navigational instruments used by George Vancouver. According to Chung Hung: \"The objective of the sculpture is to create a symbolic image with definite visual expression, awakening an awareness in Captain George Vancouver's contribution to the world, his remarkable and meticulous surveys which included the north Pacific coast.\" The sculpture is owned by the City of Vancouver, with Parks Canada serving as the sponsoring organization.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nAccording to the City of Vancouver Public Art Registry, Gate to the Northwest Passage initially received an adverse reaction from local residents. Michael Duncan, then chief curator of the Vancouver Maritime Museum, called it \"a bloody monstrosity\". One member of the five-person jury responded to the criticism: \"If people think Hung's sculpture is a poor catch, they should have seen the ones that got away.\"A 1983 article published in The Globe and Mail referred to the sculpture as the \"world's largest paper clip\". The same article included a statement from the city planning study: \"Vancouver's peerless natural setting is a permanent gift from nature. So massive and close are the North Shore mountains that no amount of human folly can ever obliterate them.\"\nReception of the work, which has become a familiar landmark, has improved over time. One travel guide by Eyewitness Books referred to Gate to the Northwest Passage as an \"imposing giant red steel\" sculpture. Frommer's includes  the sculpture in walking tours for Vancouver as a highlight of Vanier Park.\nIn 2006, the work was mentioned in a Sunday serial thriller for The Province by author Daniel Kalla. In the series, the sculpture is described as a \"massive Greek letter pi\", and later a character is found dead, hanging from the sculpture.\n\n\n== See also ==\n1980 in art\nCanadian art\nNorthwest Passage\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAn artist and a journalist agree to disagree about some public art. by Michael Cox\nArte nas ruas de Vancouver – Parte 1, 2012 (French)\nCaptain George Vancouver RN, Recording Archive for Public Sculpture in Norfolk & Suffolk", "images": [ "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/76\/Big_Giant_Staple_March_2011.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/6\/68\/Gate-to-the-Northwest-Passage.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/c\/cd\/WPVA-khamsa.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/59\/Wishing_it_was_the_weekend._%282689092139%29.jpg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/4\/4a\/Commons-logo.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/c\/cf\/Flag_of_Canada.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/4\/48\/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/9\/94\/Symbol_support_vote.svg" ], "lat": 49.27812, "lng": -123.14498 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -123.1449681, 49.2781334 ] } },

MacMillan Space Centre, founded 1968, is an astronomy museum in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, that is located at Vanier Park in Vancouver. Inside the building, there are live demonstrations on science in the GroundStation Canada Theatre, exhibits and games in the Cosmic Courtyard, and shows about astronomy in the Planetarium Star Theatre. Next to the building is the Gordon MacMillan Southam Observatory. This centre of astronomy is a popular attraction in Vancouver.\nThe Space Centre is named for H. R. MacMillan, a British Columbia industrialist and philanthropist.  The building was designed in the 1960s by architect Gerald Hamilton  to house what was then called The Centennial Museum. The planetarium was added as part of a pre-construction re-design. Outside the museum is a sculpture by George Norris called The Crab. Norris's sculpture won a 1967 design competition. The Space Centre originated as the H.R.

Part of the Vancouver Biennale, the piece was unveiled in April 2015.  Located at the intersection of  Quebec Street and Milross Avenue, near False Creek, east of Vancouver's Downtown area, the sculpture incorporates stacked cars on top of a base made from a tree trunk. It stands 10 metres (33 ft) high and weighs 11,340 kilograms (25,000 lb).\n\n\n== Background ==\nBowcott's fascination with crumbling cars started when working on tow boats on the Fraser River in the 1980s. Farmers used cars as breakwaters to stop the river banks from eroding, leaving the cars in various states of ruin. Bowcott attempted to record his impressions of the decayed vehicles in paintings, but was dissatisfied with the results. After teaching at Capilano University for 22 years, Bowcott started working on the Trans Am Totem project for the 2014–2016 Vancouver Biennale.Construction of the stack of automobiles took two years, with the assistance of Bowcott's partner Helene Aspinall and structural engineer Eric Karsh.  The Vancouver Biennale supplied 10,000 CAD of the construction and installation costs; the remainder were put up by the artist. After installing the sculpture, Bowcott launched a crowdfunding campaign that recouped 6,500 CAD of the installation costs.  Bowcott has stated that the piece is a \"sculptural response\" to the urban site. It is as much a \"celebration\" of our mobility and technology as it is a critique of \"throwaway consumer culture\".\n\n\n== Materials ==\n\nThe sculpture incorporates five vehicles atop a wood base, made from a single tree. The vehicles are (from top to bottom) a Pontiac Trans Am, a BMW 7 Series, a Honda Civic, a Volkswagen Golf Mk1 Cabriolet, and a Mercedes-Benz.  The vehicles, donated by a local scrapyard, had their engines, transmissions and drivetrains removed to reduce their weight. A solar-powered electrical system was installed to power the vehicles' headlights and taillights.  The cars are fixed to a steel column which rises through the centre of the sculpture.  Bowcott also repainted the vehicles.  The wooden base which supports the cars is from the stump of an old-growth cedar tree, which was transported from southern Vancouver Island. The tree was separated into halves along its length to incorporate the central steel column.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2015 in art\nCarhenge\nSpindle (sculpture), Berwyn, Illinois\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTrans Am Totem on the artist's website\nTime lapse of the installation process on YouTube", "images": [ "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/18\/Sportcar_sergio_luiz_ara_01.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/15\/TransAmTotemMediumNorth.JPG", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/c\/cd\/WPVA-khamsa.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/4\/4a\/Commons-logo.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/c\/cf\/Flag_of_Canada.svg", "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/c\/c8\/TransAmTotemCarDetail_%28cropped%29.JPG" ], "lat": 49.276105559999984, "lng": -123.10181388999993 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -123.1023933, 49.2762785 ] } },

In addition to being a major tourist attraction for Vancouver, the aquarium is a centre for marine research, ocean literacy education, conservation and marine animal rehabilitation.\nThe Vancouver Aquarium was one of the first facilities to incorporate professional naturalists into the galleries to interpret animal behaviours.\nPrior to this, at the London Zoo Fish House, naturalists James S. Bowerbank, Ray Lankester, David W. Mitchell and Philip H. Gosse (the creator of the word aquarium) had regularly held \"open house\" events, but the Vancouver Aquarium was the first to employ educational naturalists on a full-time basis. Aquarium research projects extend worldwide, and include marine mammal rescue and rehabilitation.\nOn August 9, 2010 Prime Minister Stephen Harper and B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell announced capital funding of up to $15 million. The province would donate $10 million in funding over the next three years to help pay for a planned expansion of the 54-year-old facility, Premier Gordon Campbell said.  Harper added that Ottawa would hand over up to $5 million to the aquarium for infrastructure upgrades. The aquarium, however, remains a nonprofit organization. The property is owned by the City of Vancouver and rented to the aquarium for $40,000 a year since 1991 (prior to which it was $1 per year).\nIn October 2009 the Vancouver Aquarium was designated as a Coastal America Learning Center by the US Environmental Protection Agency. As the first Learning Center in Canada, this designation is intended to strengthen the Canadian\/U.S. partnership for protecting and restoring shared ocean resources.On August 31st, 2020, the non-profit announced on Facebook that due to the financial stresses caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it was pausing its public programming for the time being while it engages in strategic planning for the financial sustainability of its future operations.\n\n\n== Aquarium history ==\n\nThe Vancouver Public Aquarium Association was formed in 1950 by UBC fisheries and oceanography professors Murray Newman, Carl Lietze and Wilbert Clemens. After receiving the help of timber baron H.R. MacMillan, alderman and businessman George Cunningham and $100,000 from each of the three levels of government. (City of Vancouver, Province of British Columbia, Federal Government of Canada), it opened on June 15, 1956 with the ribbon being cut by federal Minister of Fisheries James Sinclair. Sinclair's daughter 7-year-old Margaret was also present at the ribbon cutting ceremony (she would later marry Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and give birth to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau).\nOfficially Canada's first public aquarium, the Vancouver Aquarium has become the largest in Canada and one of the five largest in North America. The Vancouver Aquarium was the first aquarium in the world to capture and display an orca. Other whales and dolphins on display included belugas, narwhals and dolphins.\nIn 1975, the Vancouver Aquarium was the first aquarium accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). The aquarium is also accredited by the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA) and in 1987 was designated Canada's Pacific National Aquarium by the Canadian Federal Government.\nOn July 23, 1995, a beluga whale named Qila was born. She was the first beluga to be both conceived and born in a Canadian aquarium. A second calf, Tuvaq, was born on July 30, 2002, but died unexpectedly with no previous sign of illness on July 17, 2005.\nIn 1996, the Vancouver Park Board instituted a municipal bylaw that prevents the Vancouver Aquarium from capturing cetaceans from the wild for display purposes, and only obtain cetaceans from other facilities if they were born in captivity, captured before 1996 or were rescued and deemed un-releasable after this date.\nOn June 15, 2006 Canada Post issued a 51 cent domestic rate stamp to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the aquarium.\nFor many years, the primary attraction for visitors was the orca show. The aquarium was the first to capture and display a killer whale, Moby Doll, in a pen at Burrard Drydocks, for 3 months in 1964. Since then, it was home to Skana, Hyak II, Finna, Bjossa, and three of Bjossa's calves. When Finna died and Bjossa was left without other orca companions, the aquarium attempted to acquire one or more female orcas from other marine parks. However, no suitable companions were found, and Bjossa was moved to SeaWorld, San Diego, in April 2001 where she later died due to a chronic respiratory illness. The aquarium has since moved to emphasize the educational aspects of the displays rather than the public spectacle of the shows. They have also highlighted their research, rescue and rehabilitation efforts.\nThe aquarium has played a significant role in the research of wild orcas in BC. John Ford, a respected researcher who focuses on orca vocalizations, worked there for many years and they still fund a lot of the study. The Wild Killer Whale Adoption Program, which funds research, is also run out of the aquarium.\n\nAfter considerable public discussion and some opposition from an animal rights group, the Vancouver Park Board voted in favour of a proposal to expand the aquarium at a cost of $100 million, funded by the aquarium, private donors, and infrastructure grants. A public consultation process, led by the aquarium and their own consultants, showed 89% of local residents were in favour of the expansion. The proposal will increase the size of the aquarium by 1.5 acres (6,100 m2) and extend its lease by 20 years. Construction was expected to begin in the fall of 2007.Vancouver Aquarium has not kept any orcas in captivity since 2001 and has pledged not to capture wild animals, but to instead rely on captive animals for breeding.\n\n\n=== Temporary closure ===\nOn August 31st, 2020, the Aquarium made public via a Facebook update that it would be temporarily pausing public programming after September 7th. Despite the fact that the summer season was busy upon reopening, the social distancing requirements of being \"COVID-safe\" did not allow for the necessary visitor volume – ticket sales were down 80% and the not-for-profit was not able to cover costs. The organization stated that it would continue providing uninterrupted care to the resident animals while working on strategic planning; namely, how to operate in a way that would be financially sustainable in light of current conditions.\n\n\n== Aquarium facility ==\nThe aquarium covers approximately 9,000 square metres (97,000 sq ft) and has a total 9,500,000 litres (2,100,000 imp gal; 2,500,000 US gal) of water in 166 aquatic displays. There are a number of different galleries, several of which were built at different times throughout the aquarium's history.\n\n\n=== Pacific Canada Pavilion ===\nThis central indoor exhibit consists of a 260,000 litres (57,000 imp gal; 69,000 US gal) tank directly adjacent to the entrance. Fish and invertebrates from the Strait of Georgia are displayed in the exhibit.\n\n\n=== Steller's Bay\/Canada's Arctic ===\nOriginally this gallery included the beluga whales along with several non-living displays. In October 2009, a new exhibit opened here displaying several other arctic species, including fishes and invertebrates, along with expanded non-living exhibits as part of the Canada's Arctic Gallery. In 2016, the two rescued harbour porpoises from the BC Sugar Pool next door, moved to the Canada's Arctic Gallery. Following the deaths of two belugas in 2016, it has been converted into an active Steller sea lion research station called Steller's Bay in collaboration with the University of British Columbia. The exhibit reopened as Steller's Bay on July 1, 2017, while still retaining the Canada's Arctic portion in the underwater gallery. It is home to four female and two male Steller sea lions. In June 2018, a new \"Research Outpost\" Exhibit opened as an addition to Steller's Bay and programs about the aquarium's research and work regarding walruses, northern fur seals, and Steller sea lions occur.\n\n\n=== Penguin Point ===\nInspired by Boulders Beach, this exhibit features African penguins bred by the Species Survival Plan.\n\n\n=== The Wild Coast ===\nThis is an outdoor gallery that includes several pools, home to a Pacific white-sided dolphin and sea otters that are permanently on display here, along with a \"touchpool\" where visitors are able to touch British Columbian invertebrates. Several other species (harbour seals, Steller's sea lions, and a California sea lion) are rotated in to display in this area. When not housed in this gallery, they live in habitats that are either behind the scenes that are not accessible to visitors, Steller's Bay or the Research Outpost exhibits. There are plans to renovate the habitat into a new Canada's Arctic gallery that will house walruses and other arctic species. It is unclear what will happen to Helen, the Pacific white-sided dolphin, when construction starts in fall 2018.\n\n\n=== Treasures of the BC Coast ===\nThis gallery is a series of separate exhibits that simulate the various aquatic environments on the BC coast. Octopuses, rockfish, sea stars, sea urchins, and anemones are among the animals here.\n\n\n=== Tropic Zone ===\nThis gallery contains a large display of tropical fish and other animals, including blacktip reef sharks and a green sea turtle named Schoona.\n\n\n=== Amazon Rainforest ===\nA number of fresh water fish, snakes, caimans, sloths, birds, and other creatures from the Amazon inhabit this gallery.\n\n\n=== Frogs Forever? Gallery ===\nThis gallery is an exhibit focused on the plight of the world's frog population which endeavors to show how people can help protect frogs and other amphibians.  It contains 26 species of amphibians from around the world.\n\n\n=== Canaccord Exploration Gallery ===\nThis gallery is home to jellies, fish, and other animals.  The 4D Theatre and the children's play area known as \"Clownfish Cove\" are here, along with multiple classrooms for school groups, including the wet lab education room, which contains both conventional teaching methods such as computers, tables, and chairs, along with live animals and various artifacts.\n\n\n== Animals at the aquarium ==\n\nThe Vancouver Aquarium currently houses around 300 species of fish, almost 30,000 invertebrates, and 56 species of amphibians and reptiles. They also have around 60 mammals and birds.\nCurrently, the aquarium houses one Pacific white-sided dolphin:\n\nHelen is an approximately 30-year-old female dolphin at the aquarium. She came to the aquarium from the Enoshima Aquarium in Japan, and is also claimed to have been rescued from entanglement in a fishing net. Helen was part of a multi-year and multi-facility research project focusing on metabolic studies while she was at the Enoshima Aquarium, and is part of a pilot project to understand whale echolocation abilities to prevent whales in the future from becoming entangled in fishing nets. She is distinguishable by the fact that her pectoral flippers are partially amputated due to damage from her entanglement. Helen's tankmate Chester the false killer whale joined her at the Wild Coast on Thursday, June 24, 2015. As of November 24, 2017 Helen is the only cetacean left at Vancouver Aquarium after her tank mate Chester died earlier that same day.Past Pacific white-sided dolphins:\n\nLaverne came to Vancouver from SeaWorld San Antonio. She died in 2009 due to a twisted intestine.\nSpinnaker came to Vancouver in 2001 from Japan after getting caught in a fishing net. He died in 2012 due to a prolonged illness.\nHana came to Vancouver with Helen in 2005 from the Enoshima Aquarium in Japan after getting caught in a fixed fishing net. She died in 2015 from gastrointestinal torsion and sepsis following a last attempt to save her life with a \"breakthrough\" surgery.The aquarium used to house a false killer whale:\n\nChester was a young false killer whale that was rescued by the Vancouver Aquarium Marine Mammal Rescue Centre on Chesterman Beach on Vancouver Island in July 2014. In May 2015, Chester was deemed non-releasable by Fisheries and Oceans Canada which based their decision \"on the animal’s age at stranding, his lack of social contact and foraging skills in the wild, and his extensive contact with humans\". Chester was at the Wild Coast habitat along with Helen the Pacific white-wided dolphin. On November 24, 2017 Chester died of a bacterial infection. He was approximately 3 and a half years old.\nUntil 2016, the aquarium also housed two beluga whales. Qila was born in captivity, whereas Aurora was captured from the wild in waters near Churchill, Manitoba in 1990.\nAurora was a female beluga, who gave birth first to Qila, Tuvaq (who died in 2005) and Nala, who died on June 21 at around 10:15 pm due to coins and foreign matter found in her respiratory tract. \"Aurora\" is named after the famous northern light Aurora borealis. Aurora died on November 25, 2016 at around 30 years of age, and was the last remaining beluga at the aquarium.\nQila was a female beluga born at the aquarium to mother Aurora and father Nanuq on July 23, 1995 (21 years old). She is the first beluga to be conceived and born in a Canadian aquarium, and is also the first beluga conceived and born in a Canadian aquarium to give birth to a calf. \"Qila\" derives from the Inuktitut word qilalugaq qualuqtaq, which means \"beluga\". She gave birth to her first calf Tiqa, who died of heart failure and pneumonia on September 16, 2011. Qila died on November 16, 2016.Both belugas lived in the Canada's Arctic enclosure (Now Steller's Bay).\nOn breeding loan to SeaWorld, Shedd Aquarium & Georgia Aquarium are the following:\n\nAllua, a female beluga is around 24 years of age. She was moved to SeaWorld San Diego on a breeding loan in 2005.\nImaq, a male beluga who is around 21 years of age. He is on breeding loan to SeaWorld San Antonio. Currently he is at the Georgia Aquarium.\nGrayson, a  male beluga who is 8 years old living at the Shedd Aquarium. He was born at SeaWorld San Antonio in 2007, but belongs to the Vancouver Aquarium as he was born to Nanuq, who was owned by the aquarium and also fathered Qila. Until early 2016, Grayson was living at the Georgia Aquarium with his half-sister Qinu.\nQinu, a female beluga born in 2010 who is 7 years of age living at the Georgia Aquarium. She was also born at SeaWorld San Antonio and lived with Grayson until he was moved to the Shedd Aquarium. As with Grayson, she was born to Nanuq and belongs to the Vancouver Aquarium.Past belugas:\n\nKavna was estimated to be around 46 years of age at the time of her death on August 6, 2012. Cancerous lesions found on her reproductive tract may have contributed to her death. She was distinguishable from the other belugas by the fact that she was the whitest, due to her age.\nNanuq, was around 31 years of age at the time of his death in 2015. Nanuq was Qila's father and was on breeding loan to SeaWorld since July 1997 when he died of a jaw infection.\nTuaq was born to Kavna and an unknown wild beluga in 1977 but died 4 months later due to malnutrition and a bacterial infection.\nTuvaq was born to Aurora and Imaq in 2002 but died unexpectedly in 2005 from a heart arrhythmia.\nNala was also born to Aurora and Imaq in 2009 but died a year after due to foreign objects found inside her respiratory tract.\nTiqa was born in 2008 to Qila and Imaq and was the first 3rd generation beluga to be born at the aquarium. Tiqa's name stands for T-Tuesday, I-Imaq, Q-Qila and A-Aurora.  She died in 2011 due to pneumonia and heart failure.The Vancouver Aquarium used to house two Pacific harbour porpoise rescued by the aquarium's Marine Mammal Rescue Centre. Daisy was rescued from Gonzolez Beach, B.C. in 2008, and after receiving almost a year of veterinary care and being deemed nonreleasable, was transferred to the Vancouver Aquarium on July 29, 2009. Daisy died on June 16,\n2017 \nAnother Pacific harbour porpoise, Jack, was rescued from Horseshoe Bay, B.C. in September 2011 and transferred to the aquarium on March 15, 2012. Jack died in August 2016.\nThe aquarium is home to Seven sea otters:\n\nKatmai is a young female sea otter recently rescued near Homer, Alaska by the Alaska SeaLife Center on October 17, 2012, when she was only a few weeks old. Shortly thereafter, the Alaska SeaLife Center invited a rotating team of Vancouver Aquarium specialists to help provide intensive 24-hour care and rehabilitation for the pup over the next 17 weeks. After being deemed non-releasable by the U.S. Fisheries and Wildlife Service, she arrived at the Vancouver Aquarium on March 21, 2013. After an online naming contest, on April 2, 2013, the aquarium announced that the pup would be named Katmai after a national park in Alaska.\nRialto is a male pup that was found abandoned at Rialto Beach in Washington state's Olympic National Park by the Seattle Aquarium.  As U.S. Fisheries and Wildlife Services deemed him non-releasable and the Seattle Aquarium did not have space to accommodate another male sea otter, the decision was made to transfer him to the Vancouver Aquarium after he had recovered.  Rialto was permanently moved to Vancouver in September 2016.\nMak is a male sea otter pup who was transported to the aquarium from Alaska in November 2016 with Kunik.  Both were treated at the Alaska SeaLife Center and deemed non-releasable by the U.S. Fisheries and Wildlife Services.  Mak was found stranded in Kachemak Bay, Alaska by a member of the public.  His name derives from his rescue site.\nKunik is a female sea otter pup who was transferred to the aquarium with Mak in November 2016 after both were treated at Alaska SeaLife Center and deemed non-releasable by the U.S. Fisheries and Wildlife Services.  She found by the U.S. Coast Guard stranded on Homer Spit, Alaska, and her name is an Inuktitut word for a traditional Inuit greeting, or \"kiss.\"\nHardy is a male sea otter pup who was rescued in June 2017 at Port Hardy, is the only Canadian sea otter at the aquarium.\nTazlina is a female sea otter pup who was rescued by some fishermen trawling for salmon at Alaska’s Anchor Point in April 2019. She was only a day old when she found by the fisherman, and she got sent to Alaska SeaLife Center by some volunteer. After taking care by the animal trainer from aquarium, she moved to the aquarium in September 2019.\nJoey is a male sea otter rescued near Kyuquot, B.C. on July 2nd, 2020. He was about 10 days old and presumed the deceased, adult otter nearby was the mother.  Joey was rescued and transported to the Marine Mammal rescue Centre for treatment. Now, Joey remain at the Aquarium, with a 24 hour live stream of his recovery.  Currently, Joey has been deemed non-releasable and will remain with Vancouver Aquarium. Past otters:\n\nTanu is an adult female who was abandoned as a pup, rescued by the Alaska SeaLife Center and later moved to the aquarium.\nNyac was a female sea otter rescued from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.  She was one of the last surviving sea otters from the incident and was later featured in a viral YouTube video of sea otters \"holding hands\" recorded by Cynthia Holmes.  Nyac died on September 23, 2008 at approximately 20 years of age.  Days before her death, she was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which has been associated with contact with petroleum in other marine species.\nMilo was a male sea otter rescued and brought to the aquarium after being deemed non-releasable.  Along with Nyac, he was featured in the viral YouTube video of sea otters \"holding hands\" by Cynthia Holmes.  Milo died on January 12, 2012 at the age of 12 years after being diagnosed with lymphoma.  He was the first otter to be treated with chemotherapy as part of a unique chemotherapeutic treatment plan developed by researchers, veterinarians, and pathologists around the world.\nWalter\/Wally was found as an injured adult sea otter in Tofino, on the West Coast of Vancouver Island. He had been shot by a shotgun and suffered extensive injuries as a result. After receiving critical care at the Marine Mammal Rescue Centre he became a healthy sea otter who would not survive in the ocean and was therefore moved to the aquarium. He was estimated to be over 10 years old at the time of his rescue.  He died on December 9, 2015.\nElfin is an adult male sea otter who was abandoned as a pup, was rescued by the Alaska SeaLife Center and later moved to the aquarium. Elfin died peacefully on April 1, 2017, at the age of 16. Elfin was distinctively known for his large amount of white fur.\nThe aquarium is also home to two harbor seals at this time, all of which are male (Jessica Seal, DaVinci, and Hermes). Jessica Seal was rescued from Kitsilano Beach in 2019 after being discovered to have been shot in the head by birdshot and blinded as a result.\nThe aquarium also houses 6 northern fur seals (Meechi, Tikva, Tuku, Kyoo, Aya, and Ani), and seven Steller sea lions (Amak, Kenai, Willo, Ashby, Rogue, Bella Bella, and Izzy). Some of the sea lions actually belong to the University of British Columbia, and are part of a research program aimed at studying the causes for the collapse of the Steller sea lion population in Alaska, while Bella Bella is housed at the aquarium after being rescued as a pup on McInnes Island in June 2017 and being deemed non-releasable. Amak and Kenai are half-siblings who were both born at Ocean Park Hong Kong in 2010 and lived at a Japanese facility before being transferred to the Vancouver Aquarium in May 2017.\nThe aquarium also currently houses an adult male California sea lion (Señor Cinco) who was found with gunshot wounds on Vancouver's Spanish Banks on May 5, 2017, and blinded as a result. He is their first California sea lion on display and currently lives in the BC Sugar Pool habitat.\nAt an off-site research facility, an additional 4 Steller sea lions are kept as part of an open-water research program. They are Hazy, Sitka, Boni, and Yasha.\nOn July 1, 2008, Tag, a 15-year-old male sea lion, died due to oral cancer, despite receiving laser surgery and chemotherapy. Tag was a 15-year-old male sea lion who arrived at the aquarium as a 2-week-old pup.The aquarium has one green sea turtle (Schoona). Schoona is a 16-year-old sea turtle, who has arrived at the aquarium in 2005.\nGiselle is a zebra shark who arrived at the Vancouver Aquarium around 2008. Giselle is around 15 years old.\n\n\n== Mammals at the aquarium ==\n\n\n== Vancouver Aquarium Amazon Gallery ==\n\n\n== Frogs Forever? ==\n\n\n== Conservation and research programs ==\nThe Vancouver Aquarium has created and operates a number of conservation and research programs aimed at understanding and preserving animal species in the wild.\n\n\n=== Ocean Wise Seafood ===\nThe Vancouver Aquarium has a program called Ocean Wise Seafood, which is aimed at promoting sustainable seafood in restaurants, markets, and other food service facilities. Its main thrust is to avoid species whose fishing typically causes large bycatches, species from areas where the habitat will degrade if overfished, and species which themselves are overfished. Ocean Wise works directly with food service companies to select sustainable seafood and actively promote them to the general public. The options are highlighted on participating restaurant menus and display cases with the Ocean Wise symbol, to help consumers make environmentally friendly seafood choices. Today, well over 700 restaurants and food stores in Canada are participants in the Ocean Wise sustainable seafood program.\n\n\n=== Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup ===\nThe Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup is a program that was initiated by the Vancouver Aquarium by a small group of staff members and volunteers in 1994. These employees had heard about the International Coastal Cleanup and decided to participate in it by picking up garbage at a local beach and submitting the information. The Ocean Conservancy's International Coastal Cleanup is an annual international initiative aimed to engage people to remove trash and debris from the world's beaches and waterways, identify the sources of debris, and change the behaviors that cause marine debris in the first place.\nVolunteers and sponsors collect and catalogue debris which is then collected for analysis on sources of garbage that enter the ocean. For example, in 2007, 1,240 beach sites with a collective length of 1,772 km were cleaned by 52,263 volunteers bringing in almost 87.5 metric tons of garbage.\n\n\n=== Marine Mammal Rescue and Rehabilitation Program ===\nThe Vancouver Aquarium operates a Marine Mammal Rescue program which is aimed at rescuing and rehabilitating marine mammals that are found injured, ill, or abandoned, until they can be re-released into their natural habitats. On average, the Rescue Centre admits approximately 100 distressed marine mammals per year. The vast majority of these are harbour seals, but patients can include sea otters, elephant seals, Steller sea lions, harbour porpoises, and common dolphins. The program notably helped rescue Springer, an orphaned killer whale successfully released and reunited with her family pod. Other high-profile rescues include the successful returning of a beached grey whale back to the water in 2005 and the rescue of Schoona, a lost green sea turtle near Prince Rupert, BC. In October 2013, rescued harbour porpoise Levi became the first cetacean to be rehabilitated at the Marine Mammal Rescue Centre and released back into the wild.\n\n\n=== B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network ===\nThe B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network is a collaborative conservation and research program between the Vancouver Aquarium and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada aimed at collecting reports and sightings of whales and sea turtles in the wild. The Sightings Network is a network of over 1,800 observers across British Columbia, including whale watching operators, lighthouse keepers, charter boat operators, tugboat captains, BC Ferries personnel, researchers, government employees, recreational boaters and coastal residents. The program aims to solicit reports through the program's website, a toll-free hotline, email, or through the logbook program.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn 2014, the Vancouver Aquarium's practice of keeping whales, dolphins and porpoises in captivity and its beluga whale breeding program sparked controversy.\nIn March 2014, two Park Board Commissioners, Sarah Blyth and Constance Barnes, publicly spoke out against the practice of keeping whales and dolphins in captivity at the aquarium. Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson, in an emailed letter to The Georgia Straight, expressed his personal belief that \"the Vancouver Aquarium should begin to phase out the holding of whales and dolphins in captivity\". Primatologist and ethologist Jane Goodall called for the Park Board to follow through with the proposed \"phase out\" of cetaceans and end the Vancouver Aquarium's captive breeding program.The Vancouver Aquarium responded to criticism with an open letter in which they explained that it was their policy not to capture cetaceans from the wild and that the aquarium played a role as a home for rescued cetaceans that cannot be returned to the wild.\nThe Park Board proceeded to commission an independent report from US wildlife veterinarian and scientist Dr. Joseph Gaydos in which he examined the aquarium's animal care standards, accreditation and research and compared it to similar facilities in North America. In his report he found that the Vancouver Aquarium \"either meets or exceeds North American industry standards\". He also concluded that the aquarium had \"an active research department that seems to make good use of studying captive cetaceans, not only for being able to provide better care and understanding of captive animals, but to a greater extent [...] to benefit our understanding and conservation of cetaceans in the wild.\" Dr Gaydos also made two recommendations. He recommended that the Park Board conduct \"a large-scale scientific study on the welfare of captive housed cetaceans\" as a way of assessing \"the complex societal issue of captive cetaceans\". He also suggested that the Park Board require the aquarium to release an annual report on the state of its cetaceans.\nIn the media, the Gaydos report was widely received as a positive review of the aquarium's practices and the Vancouver Aquarium also received support from prominent philanthropists and politicians, as well as four former Vancouver mayors. The Monterey Bay Aquarium and the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California also spoke out in favour of the Vancouver Aquarium's cetacean program, citing its importance for scientific research.After a long public debate that ended with the presentation of the Gaydos report and two days of public hearings, the Vancouver Park Board announced in August 2014 that it intended to enact a by-law to ban breeding of cetaceans at the Vancouver Aquarium, and it tasked its staff with drafting an amendment to the existing by-law regulating cetaceans at the aquarium. Vancouver Aquarium CEO Dr. John Nightingale criticized the decision in a public letter, stating that the decision \"was not based on the facts or science presented\" and that it did not take into consideration \"testimony from dozens of the world’s scientific community, including experts in animal welfare and animal cognition.\".Following a defeat in the elections to Park Board as part of the 2014 civic elections, a majority of the Park Board commissioners, in their last session, voted against enacting an amendment to the by-law.\n\n\n=== Federal law banning captivity of cetaceans ===\nIn 2019, the Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act became law in Canada.  Two facilities would be affected, Marineland of Canada and the Vancouver Aquarium. When passed in June 2019, Marineland was reported to have 61 cetaceans, while the Vancouver Aquarium had just one dolphin remaining. The law has a grandfather clause, permitting those cetaceans already in captivity to remain where they are, but breeding and further acquisition of cetaceans is prohibited, subject to limited exceptions.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Vancouver Aquarium was featured frequently in the 1980s Canadian series, Danger Bay, which followed the day to day exploits of the Roberts family, led by Grant \"Doc\" Roberts, a marine veterinarian and his two children, Nicole and Jonah.\nA YouTube video featuring two sea otters \"holding hands\" was recorded at the Vancouver Aquarium. The two sea otters are Nyac and Milo. Nyac died on September 23, 2008. She was one of the last surviving sea otters of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. The video has been viewed over 19 million times on YouTube. As a result, the Vancouver Aquarium created a live sea otter cam on their website. The YouTube video was originally recorded by Cynthia Holmes. Milo died on January 12, 2012.The Vancouver Aquarium was also featured in the family film Andre (1994), and romantic comedy Good Luck Chuck (2007), as Cam's workplace. Television movie The Suite Life Movie (2011) used the aquarium as the research firm where Cody Martin interns.\nOn September 5, 2008, Hayden Panettiere appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman and talked about her visit with the rescue dolphins at the Vancouver Aquarium.\nThe song \"Baby Beluga\" by Raffi was inspired by Kavna, a beluga that he saw while visiting the Vancouver Aquarium.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\nWaters is a magazine published by Canada Wide Media Limited for the official members of the Vancouver Aquarium.
